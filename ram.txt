CHAPTER     X 

Shri  Narada  relates  to  Valmiki  the  story  of  Rama 

The  Sage  Valmiki,1  chief  among  the  munis1  and  the  most 
eloquent  of  men,  constantly  engaged  in  the  practice  of  self- 
control  and  the  study  of  the  holy  scriptures,  enquired  of  Shri 
Narada  :3 — 

"  Who  is  there  in  the  world  to-day,  endowed  with  excellent 
and  heroic  qualities,  who  is  versed  in  all  the  duties  of  life, 
grateful,  truthful,  firm  in  his  vows,  an  actor  of  many  parts, 
benevolent  to  all  beings,  learned,  eloquent,  handsome,  patient, 
slow  to  anger,  one  who  is  truly  great ;  who  is  free  from  envy 
and  when  excited  to  wrath  can  strike  terror  into  the  hearts 
of  celestial  beings  ?  O  Sage,  I  would  hear  of  such  a  man  from 
thee,  who  art  able  to  describe  him  to  me.1' 

Narada,  acquainted  with  the  past,  the  present  and  the  future, 
pleased  with  the  words  of  the  Sage  Valmiki,  answered  him 
saying: — 

"  Rare  indeed  are  those,  endowed  with  the  qualities  thou 
hast  enumerated,  yet  I  can  tell  thee  of  such  a  one.  Born  in 
the  family  of  Ikshwaku,*  he  is  named  Rama  ;*  one  renowned, 
fully  self-controlled,  valorous  and  illustrious,  the  Lord  of  AIL 
Wise,  conversant  with  the  ethical  code,  eloquent,  fortunate} 
a  slayer  of  his  foes,  broad-shouldered,  long-armed,  possessing 
a  conch-shaped  neck  and  prominent  chin,  eminent  in  archery, 
with  a  muscular  body,  arms  extending  to  the  knees,  and  a 
noble  head  and  brow ;   of  mighty  prowess  ;   possessing  well-

proportioned  limbs  and  skin  of  bluish  tint,1  one  renowned  for 
his  virtue ;  of  prominent  eyes,  deep-chested,  bearing  auspicious 
marks ;  one  who  protects  those  who  take  refuge  in  him  and  is 
ever-mindful  of  the  good  of  those  dependent  on  him  ;  true  to 
his  promises,  benevolent  to  his  subjects,  omniscient,  renowned 
for  his  good  deeds,  pure,  and  ever  responsive  to  devotion  ;  med- 
itating on  his  own  essence. 

"  Equal  to  Brahma,  the  Protector  of  his  people,  pleasing  to 
look  upon ;  supporting  the  universe ;  the  destroyer  of  those 
who  contravene  the  moral  code ;  the  inspirer  of  virtue ;  the 
giver  of  special  grace  to  his  devotees  and  to  those  who  duly 
observe  sacrificial  rites  and  are  charitable ;  conversant  with 
the  essence  of  the  Vedic  philosophy  ;  an  adept  in  the  science 
of  warfare ;  skilled  in  the  scriptural  law  ;  of  infallible  memory  ; 
beloved  of  all ;  of  courteous  disposition  ;  incapable  of  cowardice  ; 
acquainted  with  the  laws  of  this  world  as  also  of  the  other 
worlds. 

"As  the  rivers  hasten  to  the  ocean,  so  do  men  of  virtue  ever 
approach  him. 

"  Equal  to  Vishnu2  in  valour ;  grateful  to  the  sight  as  the 
full  moon ;  when  stirred  to  righteous  anger,  resembling  all- 
consuming  death ;  in  patience  like  the  earth,  in  generosity  like 
Kuvera  ;*  in  truthfulness  the  personification  of  virtue.  Such 
are  his  great  qualities — Rama,  the  beloved  heir  of  King  Dasar- 
atha,  possessing  every  excellent  attribute,  benevolent  to  all, 
devoted  to  the  welfare  of  every  living  being." 

His  father,  King  Dasaratha,  made  preparations  to  install  him 
as  his  regent,  but  the  Queen  Kaikeyi,  claiming  the  boons  formerly 
promised  to  her,  demanded  the  exile  of  Rama  and  the  enthrone- 
ment of  her  own  son  Bharata.  The  king  held  by  his  promise 
and  by  the  ties  of  honour,  sent  his  son  Rama,  whom  he  loved 
as  his  own  life,  into  exile.  Obeying  the  command  of  his  royal 
sire,  and  in  order  to  gratify  Kaikeyi,  Shri  Rama  went  to  the 
forest. 

The  son  of  Queen  Sumitra,  Prince  Lakshmana,  inspired  by 
affection  and  humility,  followed  his  brother  Rama  into  exile.

The  daughter  of  King  Janaka,  an  incarnation  of  Lakshmi,1 
endowed  with  the  highest  feminine  virtues,  seeing  Prince 
Lakshmana  accompanying  Rama,  obedient  to  her  lord,  followed 
him  as  Venus  follows  the  moon. 

Accompanied  for  some  leagues  by  King  Dasaratha  and  his 
people,  Rama  dismissed  the  chariot  on  reaching  the  town  of 
Shringavera  on  the  banks  of  the  Ganges,  and  commanded  the 
minister  Sumantra  to  return  to  the  capital. 

Here  the  prince  met  his  beloved  Guha,  the  chief  of  the 
Chandalas,3  accompanied  by  whom,  with  Lakshmana  and  Sita, 
he  crossed  the  river  Ganges  and  entered  the  forest,  arriving  at 
length  at  the  Chittrakuta  mountain  described  by  the  Sage 
Bharadwaja.  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sita  dwelt  happily  in  the 
forest  like  devas3  or  gandharvas,* 

Overwhelmed  with  grief  at  the  separation  from  his  sons  and 
lamenting  their  absence,  the  king  departed  this  life,  while  Rama 
was  dwelling  on  the  Chittrakuta  mountain. 

The  holy  sages  offered  the  throne,  left  vacant  on  the  death 
of  King  Dasaratha,  to  Prince  Bharata,  who  declined  it,  not 
desiring  the  kingdom.  Setting  forth  to  the  forest  where  Shri 
Rama  dwelt,  in  order  to  propitiate  him,  he  approached  that  hero 
of  truth  with  humility  and  directing  his  attention  to  the  code 
of  justice  with  which  he  was  conversant,  requested  Rama  to 
return  and  govern  the  kingdom. 

The  magnanimous,  handsome  and  mighty  Rama  refused  to 
accept  the  throne,  preferring  to  carry  out  the  command  of  his 
sire  and,  presenting  Prince  Bharata  with  his  sandals  as  a  symbol 
of  authority,  repeatedly  exhorted  him  to  return  to  the  capital. 

Shri  Bharata,  touching  the  feet  of  Rama  in  submission, 
departed  and  began  to  rule  the  dominion  from  the  town  of 
Nandigrama,  while  eagerly  awaiting  the  return  of  his  brother. 

The  sages  and  hermits,  who  dwelt  in  the  forest,  constantly 
harassed  by  asuras,6  approached  Shri  Ramachandra  to  ask  for 
his  protection — Shri  Rama  agreed  to  slay  the  evil  asuras  in 
order  to  preserve  the  Sages  who  had  sought  his  help.   The  holy

men,  whose  appearance  equalled  the  fire  in  lustre,  heard  of 
Shri  Rama's  resolve  and  were  assured  by  him  of  his  pro- 
tection. 

The  female  asura  Shurpanakha,  who  could  assume  various 
forms  at  will,  was  overpowered  and  disfigured  by  Rama  and 
Lakshmana.  All  the  wicked  rakshasas1  came  led  by  Khara, 
Dushana  and  Trishira,  to  engage  in  combat  with  Shri  Rama,  and 
were  slain  by  him.  Shri  Rama  slew  fourteen  thousand  rakshasas 
who  dwelt  in  that  forest.  Hearing  of  the  slaughter  of  the 
rakshasas,  King  Ravana  transported  with  rage,  took  with  him 
Maricha,  a  demon  like  himself.  Maricha,  knowing  the  superior 
strength  of  Rama,  sought  to  dissuade  Ravana  from  entering 
into  combat  with  him,  but  Ravana  who  was  marked  down  by 
destiny,  disregarded  the  advice  and  went  with  Maricha  to  Shri 
Rama's  abode.  There,  Maricha  lured  Shri  Rama  and  Laksh- 
mana away  from  the  hermitage,  and  Ravana,  having  slain  the 
vulture  Jatayu,  carried  Sita  away. 

Learning  from  the  dying  Jatayu  of  the  abduction  of  the 
daughter  of  the  King  of  Mithila,  Shri  Rama  was  overwhelmed 
with  grief  and  began  to  mourn. 

Having  performed  the  funeral  rites  of  the  vulture,  while 
wandering  in  search  of  Sita,  he  encountered  an  asura  named 
Kabandha  whose  form  was  menacing  and  terrible. 

Shri  Rama  slew  him  and  then  performed  the  funeral  rites 
whereupon  his  soul  ascended  to  heaven.  While  passing  to  the 
celestial  sphere,  Kabandha  spoke  to  Rama  of  Shabari,  a  female 
ascetic,  and  entreated  him  to  visit  her.  Shri  Rama,  the  ever 
resplendent  Destroyer  of  his  foes,  came  to  where  Shabari  dwelt 
and  was  duly  worshipped  by  her. 

On  the  banks  of  the  Lake  Pampa,  Shri  Rama  met  the  monkey 
Hanuman  who  presented  Sugriva  to  him.  The  mighty  Rama 
related  the  whole  of  his  story  to  him  as  far  as  the  abduction 
of  Shri  Sita.  Sugriva  having  listened  to  Shri  Rama  entered 
into  the  rite  of  friendship  with  him,  witnessed  by  the  fire. 
With  full  faith  in  Rama,  Sugriva  then  recounted  to  him  all 
the  sufferings  he  had  endured  through  his  enmity  with  Bali8 
and  the  great  daring  of  the  latter.    Then  Shri  Rama  vowed  to 

1  Evil  spirits  or  fiends,  enemies  of  the  gods.

slay  Bali,  but  Sugriva,  uncertain  of  Rama's  prowess  and  desiring  to 
test  him,  snowed  him  the  bones  of  the  body  of  Dundhubi,1 
forming  a  heap  as  high  as  a  mountain.  With  his  foot,  Rama 
kicked  the  heap  to  a  distance  of  ten  yojanas  and,  discharging  an 
arrow,  pierced  seven  palmyra  trees,  cleaving  a  mountain  and  with 
the  shaft  penetrating  to  the  centre  of  the  earth.  Having  witnessed 
this  exploit,  Sugriva  was  satisfied,  and  thereafter  trusted  Rama 
implicitly.  In  his  company  he  passed  through  deep  valleys  to 
the  town  of  Kishkindhya ;  there,  the  yellow-eyed  Sugriva  roared 
like  thunder.  At  this  terrible  sound,  the  powerful  and  valiant 
monkey  chief,  Bah,  issued  forth,  disregarding  the  warning  of 
his  wife  Tara,  and  engaged  in  combat  with  Sugriva. 

As  desired  by  Sugriva,  Shri  Rama  slew  Bali  with  a  single 
arrow;  then  he  entrusted  the  government  of  Kishkindhya 
to  Sugriva  who  now,  as  king  of  the  monkey  tribe,  gathered 
his  forces  together  and  dispatched  them  to  every  quarter  in 
search  of  Sita. 

The  vulture  chief,  the  courageous  Sampati,  informed  Hanu- 
man  where  Sita  was,  whereupon  the  monkey  leapt  over  the  sea 
that  lies  between  Bharatvarsh1  and  Lanka,3  a  distance  of  five 
hundred  miles. 

Entering  the  city  of  Lanka  that  was  protected  by  Ravana, 
Hanuman  beheld  Sita,  meditating  on  Rama  in  the  ashoka  garden. 
He  there  delivered  Rama's  ring  to  her  and  acquainted  her  with 
the  welfare  of  her  lord.  Having  revived  the  courage  of  Sita, 
he  shattered  the  gate  of  the  garden  and  slew  seven  sons  of  the 
counsellors  of  Ravana,  five  great  captains  and  levelled  Akshya- 
kumara,  the  son  of  Ravana,  to  the  dust.  Then  he  suffered 
himself  to  be  taken  captive. 

Knowing  he  could  not  be  subdued  by  the  weapon  granted  by 
Brahma  to  Ravana,  yet  acknowledging  the  power  of  its  blessing,* 
Hanuman  allowed  himself  to  be  imprisoned,  suffering  many 
indignities.  Subsequently  he  burnt  the  whole  of  Lanka,  only 
sparing  the  place  where  Sita  dwelt.

*  The  God  Brahma  had  given  Ravana  a  weapon  which  entangled  everyone  on 
whom  it  was  used  bo  that  they  could  not  escape.  It  was  Fitting,  therefore,  that 
Hanuman,  though  not  subject  to  it,  should  acknowledge  the  goat  power. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Returning  to  deliver  his  welcome  tidings,  he  respectfully 
circumambulated  the  mighty  Rama  and  recounted  in  detail  how 
he  had  found  Sim. 

Setting  out  in  the  company  of  Sugriva  and  others,  Rama 
reached  the  sea.  There  he  created  a  tempest  by  his  shining 
arrows  and  the  Lord  of  the  waters,  Sumudra,  appeared  before 
him.  Under  his  direction,  Nala  threw  a  bridge  over  the  sea. 
Crossing  the  sea  by  means  of  this  bridge,  Shri  Rama  entered 
Lanka,  slew  Ravana  in  battle  and  recovered  Sita,  but  she  being 
the  subject  of  slander,  was  addressed  by  him  with  harsh  words  in 
the  midst  of  the  assembly.  After  hearing  the  words  of  Rama 
with  forbearance,  Sita  entered  a  great  fire.  On  the  testimony 
of  the  fire  god,  Sita  was  proved  to  be  innocent  and  Rama, 
adored  by  all  the  gods,  was  content. 

The  animate  and  inanimate  beings  of  the  three  worlds,1  the 
gods  and  the  sages,  gave  thanks  that  Ravana  had  been  slain  by 
Shri  Rama.  Shri  Rama  enthroned  Vibishana2  as  the  king  of 
the  asuras  and,  being  wholly  satisfied,  revived  all  the  monkeys 
and  asuras  who  had  fallen  in  battle. 

In  the  aerial  chariot,  Pushpaka,  accompanied  by  Sugriva, 
Shri  Rama,  a  devotee  of  truth,  reached  the  hermitage  of 
Bharadwaja.  From  there,  he  sent  Hanuman  to  Prince  Bharata, 
as  his  messenger  and  conversing  with  Sugriva  again  mounted 
the  aerial  chariot  and  arrived  at  Nandigrarna. 

Ever  obedient  to  his  father,  Shri  Rama  then  cut  off  his  matted 
locks  and  with  Sita  occupied  the  throne  of  Ayodhya. 

Seeing  Shri  Rama  occupying  the  throne,  the  people  were 
happy  and  satisfied,  virtuous  and  free  from  sickness,  sorrow, 
famine  or  danger.  None  witnessed  the  death  of  his  son ;  no 
woman  became  a  widow  and  all  were  devoted  to  their  husbands ; 
there  was  no  danger  from  tempests ;  none  perished  by  water ; 
nor  was  there  any  cause  of  fear  from  fire ;  fever  and  plague 
were  unknown ;  there  was  no  want,  and  no  danger  from  thieves. 
Cities  and  villages  were  rich  and  prosperous ;  all  lived  happily 
as  in  the  Satya  Yuga.3

gave  much  gold,  and  hundreds  of  thousands  of  cows  in  charity, 
thus  preparing  for  themselves  a  place  in  the  divine  regions. 
Shri  Rama  added  incalculably  to  the  prosperity  of  the  dynasty, 
and  bestowed  immense  wealth  on  the  brahmins.  He  employed 
his  subjects  in  the  duties  of  their  respectives  castes  and  ruled 
for  eleven  thousand  years,  after  which  he  returned  to  his  celestial 
abode,  Vaikuntha. 

He  who  reads  the  story  of  Rama,  which  imparts  merit  and 
purity,  is  freed  from  all  sin.  He  who  reads  it  with  faith  and 
devotion  is  ultimately  worshipped  together  with  his  sons, 
grandsons  and  servants  at  his  death. 

A  brahmin1  reading  this  becomes  proficient  in  the  Vedas, 
and  philosophy ;  a  kshatriya1  becomes  a  king ;  a  vaishya1  grows 
prosperous  in  trade ;  a  shudra,1  on  reading  this  will  become 
great  in  his  caste. 


CHAPTER    2 

Sage  Valmiki  creates  the  metrical  form  for  the  story 

The  wise  and  eloquent  Valmiki  with  his  disciple,  Bharadwaja, 
having  listened  to  the  words  of  Narada,  was  filled  with  wonder 
and  worshipped  Rama  in  his  heart.  He  offered  obeisance  to 
Shri  Narada,  who  craved  permission  to  depart  and  on  his  request 
being  granted  he  ascended  through  space  to  the  heavens. 

Narada,  having  departed,  the  great  Muni  Valmiki  proceeded 
to  the  banks  of  the  river  Tamasa,  which  was  close  to  the  Ganges. 
Reaching  that  place  and  seeing  the  pure  and  limpid  waters, 
Valmiki  said  to  his  disciple :  "  O  Bharadwaja,  behold  how  pure 
is  the  water  of  the  holy  river,  verily  it  is  clear  and  pleasant 
like  the  mind  of  a  good  man.  O  Child,  set  down  the  waterpot 
and  fetch  me  my  bark  robe  from  the  hermitage.  I  wish  to  bathe 
in  the  sacred  stream,  delay  not." 

Obedient  to  the  command  of  his  Guru,2  the  disciple  brought 

1  The  four  traditional  castes  ;    the  priests,  the  warriors,  the  merchants  and 
those  who  serve  the  other  three

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  raiment  from  the  Sage's  hermitage  and  returning  speedily, 
offered  it  to  him.  Receiving  the  robe  of  bark  from  the  hands 
of  his  disciple,  the  sage,  with  his  senses  fully  controlled,  girded 
it  about  him  and  while  bathing  repeated  the  traditional  prayers, 
offering  libations  of  water  to  his  ancestors  and  the  gods.  Then 
he  wandered  about  in  the  forest  enjoying  the  beauties  of  nature. 

Now  the  august  sage,  Shri  Valmiki,  beheld  a  pair  of  Krauncha1 
birds  fearlessly  disporting  themselves  in  love.  Soon  after,  a 
fowler  stealing  up  unobserved,  slew  the  male  bird  in  the 
presence  of  the  sage.  The  female  bird,  deprived  of  her  yellow 
crested  companion,  who  but  now  had  been  spreading  his  wings 
in  the  act  of  love  to  please  her,  perceiving  him  bleeding  and 
crying  out  in  distress,  began  to  mourn. 

The  heart  of  the  sage  was  filled  with  pity  on  seeing  the  bird 
struck  down  by  the  fowler.  Touched  by  the  lament  of  the 
female  krauncha  and  incensed  by  the  cruel  act  of  the  fowler, 
the  sage  said :  "  O  Fowler,  having  killed  the  bird  in  the  midst 
of  the  enjoyment  of  love  with  its  mate,  thou  shalt  never  attain 
prosperity.  Do  not  visit  the  forest  for  many  years  lest  evil 
overtake  thee." 

Reflecting  on  the  words  he  had  addressed  to  the  fowler  and 
realising  their  implication,  the  sage  said  to  himself :  "  What 
words  are  these  that  I  have  uttered,  inspired  by  my  compassion 
for  the  dying  bird  ?  " 

The  wise  and  learned  sage  reflected  a  moment,  and  then  said 
to  his  disciple :  "  Grieving  for  the  dying  bird,  I  have  recited 
this  verse  of  four  feet,  each  of  equal  syllables,  which  can  be 
sung  to  the  vina.*  May  it  bring  me  renown  and  may  no  ill 
be  spoken  of  me  on  account  of  this." 

With  great  delight  the  disciple  committed  to  memory  the  verse 
composed  by  his  spiritual  preceptor,  who  expressed  his  satisfac- 
tion at  the  skill  of  his  pupU  Bharadwaja.  Bathing  in  the  sacred 
river,  according  to  the  prescribed  ritual,  the  sage  returned  to 
his  hermitage,  pondering  over  the  matter.  The  humble  and 
learned  disciple  Bharadwaja  followed  the  great  Sage,  carrying 
his  loshta  filled  with  water. 

On  entering  the  hermitage,  the  sage  worshipped  the  Lord

*  Vina.    A  musical  stringed  instrument.

and  performed  other  rituals  and  having  instructed  his  disciple 
in  the  tradition  and  the  sacred  history,  passed  into  deep 
meditation.  The  Creator  of  the  world,  the  Self-born,  the  four- 
faced  and  glorious  Brahma  at  length  appeared  before  the  holy 
sage.  Valmiki  rose  hastily,  filled  with  astonishment,  and 
welcoming  the  Deity  in  great  humility,  offered  obeisance  to 
Him.  Leading  Him  to  a  seat,  in  profound  reverence  he  poured 
forth  libations  of  water  as  enjoined  in  the  tradition,  making 
enquiries  as  to  His  welfare.  The  Blessed  Lord  accepted  the 
homage  offered  to  Him  and  commanded  the  sage  to  be  seated. 
Shri  Valmiki  occupied  the  place  designated  by  Brahma  and 
once  more  recollected  his  grief  over  the  incident  of  the  wicked 
fowler,  who  ruthlessly  slew  the  bird  that  was  so  happy  and 
cooing  with  delight.  He  recalled  the  grief  of  the  female  bird 
and  read  and  re-read  the  lines : — 

"  By  the  ignorant  and  wicked  fowler,  grief  is  born 
For  he  has  wantonly  slain  the  melodious  krauncha." 

Shri  Brahma,  seeing  the  sage  afflicted  and  sorrowful,  said  to  him : 
"  O  Great  Sage,  let  these  words  spontaneously  uttered  by  thee, 
inspired  by  the  death  of  the  krauncha,  be  poetry.  Do  thou 
describe  the  whole  story  of  Rama,  who  is  the  essence  of  virtue 
and  full  of  the  highest  attributes,  in  accordance  with  what  thou 
hast  heard  from  Shri  Narada.  Do  thou  narrate  all  the  known 
and  hitherto  unknown  deeds  of  Shri  Rama,  Sita  and  Lakshmana 
and  the  asuras.  Whatever  relates  to  King  Dasaratha,  his 
wives,  city,  palace,  sayings,  conduct  and  what  he  accomplished, 
will  be  revealed  to  thee  by  my  favour.  None  of  thy  words 
will  prove  false.  Do  thou  render  into  verse  the  sacred  and 
delightful  deeds  of  Rama.  O  Sage,  as  long  as  the  mountains 
and  rivers  remain  on  the  earth,  so  long  will  the  story  of  Shri 
Rama  endure.  So  long  as  the  story  of  Rama  endures,  so  long 
shalt  thou  abide  in  the  higher  regions." 

Having  uttered  these  words,  Shri  Brahma  pondered  awhile 
within  Himself  and  then  vanished  from  sight. 

The  great  sage  and  his  disciple  were  filled  with  amazement 
at  this  event,  and  reading  the  stanza  again  and  again,  their 
delight  grew.  Repeatedly  reciting  the  couplet,  composed  by 
Valmiki,  they  realised  that  the  holy  sage  had  expressed  his  sorrow

in  poetic  form.  Then  Shri  Valmiki  meditated  on  the  Lord 
within  his  soul  and  it  occurred  to  him  to  relate  the  story  of  Rama 
in  similar  verse.  For  the  good  of  the  world,  the  illustrious 
and  holy  sage,  therefore,  began  composing  the  life  of  Shri  Rama 
in  verse ;  that  Rama,  worthy  of  world-wide  renown,  who  is 
both  generous  and  charming.  Shri  Valmiki  composed  the  story 
of  the  life  of  Rama  and  of  the  slaying  of  Ravana  in  beautiful 
and  measured  stanzas,  a  work  of  infinite  merit

The  deeds  of  Rama  that  will  be  described  in  the  sacred  poem 

Having  heard  the  story  of  the  life  of  the  sagacious  Rama  from 
the  lips  of  Shri  Narada  which,  when  recounted,  confers  perfect 
righteousness  on  the  hearer,  the  holy  sage  wished  to  know  more 
concerning  tile  sacred  theme.  Washing  his  hands  and  feet  and 
drinking  a  little  pure  water,  placing  himself  facing  the  east  on 
a  seat  of  kusha  grass,  with  joined  palms,  he  passed  into  profound 
meditation  and  in  a  vision  beheld  the  history  of  Rama.  Through 
the  grace  of  Shri  Brahma,  the  holy  sage  saw  all  that  Rama, 
Sita  and  Lakshmana  had  experienced,  observed  and  done.  He 
witnessed  in  detail  the  life  of  Rama,  who  was  truth  incarnate 
and  all  that  he  had  accomplished  in  the  forest  and  other  places. 

By  the  power  of  spiritual  meditation  and  yoga,  the  Sage 
Valmiki  saw  the  whole  past  as  clearly  as  if  it  were  a  fruit  placed 
on  the  palm  of  his  hand.  Thus,  having  witnessed  all,  the  most 
enlightened  sage  began  to  describe  the  life  of  Shri  Rama  in  verse. 

The  history  of  Shri  Rama,  which  confers  righteousness, 
worldly  prosperity  and  delight  on  the  reader,  which  does  not 
degrade  the  mind  and  grants  release  from  sorrow,  that  story 
which  charms  the  heart  and  is  as  full  of  lovely  gems  as  is  the  sea, 
was  rendered  by  Shri  Valmiki,  in  the  form  in  which  Shri  Narada 
had  related  it  to  him.

CHAPTER    4 

Skri  Rama's  sons  chant  the  poem 

While  Shri  Rama  was  still  King  of  Ayodhya,  the  great  Sage 
Valmiki  composed  this  beautiful  classic. 

The  holy  rishi  composed  twenty-four  thousand  verses  and 
divided  them  into  five  hundred  chapters  and  six  books.  In 
addition,  he  composed  the  epilogue.  The  work  being  completed, 
he  reflected  thus :  "  To  whom  shall  I  teach  this  classic  ?  " 

While  the  sage  was  reflecting  on  the  matter,  the  two  princes, 
Kusha  and  Lava,  the  offspring  of  Rama  and  Sita  approached 
him  and  touched  his  feet  in  reverence.  The  great  sage  studied 
these  two  virtuous  princes  of  mellifluous  speech,  who  dwelt 
with  him  in  his  hermitage  at  that  time.  Knowing  them  to  be 
wise  and  full  of  faith  in  the  teachings  of  the  Vedas,  the  great 
sage,  who  had  expounded  the  meaning  of  the  scriptures  in  his 
verses,  taught  the  classic  to  them. 

The  great  Valmiki  taught  them  the  classic  describing  the 
deeds  of  Rama  and  Sita  and  all  that  relates  to  the  incidents 
leading  to  the  slaying  of  Ravana  named  "The  Slaying  of  the 
Grandson  of  Foulastya  'V  This  historical  classic  is  pleasant  to 
sing  and  adapted  to  the  three  measures  of  time,1  it  is  contained 
within  the  seven  notes  and  can  be  sung  to  the  vina.  It  expresses 
the  various  moods  of  love,  courage,  disgust,  anger,  terror, 
compassion,  wonder,  laughter  and  serenity. 

The  two  princes  were  skilled  musicians,  proficient  in  rhythm 
and  melody  and  had  sweet  voices ;  they  were  as  comely  to 
look  at  as  Gandharvas.3  Endowed  with  god-like  beauty,  the 
two  sweet  singers,  the  reflected  images  of  Shri  Rama  himself, 
constantly  repeated  the  holy  classic  and  committed  it  to 
memory.  The  two  adorable  and  charming  princes  skilfully 
recited  the  holy  classic,  the  Ramayana,  which  extols  virtues 
before  the  sages,  the  learned  brahmins  and  the  ascetics,  as  they 
had  been  instructed  to  do.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

On  a  particular  occasion,  the  two  princes,  great-souled, 
fortunate,  and  equipped  with  all  good  qualities,  chanted  the 
great  epic  in  Shri  Rama's  assembly.  The  listening  sages  were 
visibly  moved  and  shed  tears  of  delight.  Being  overcome  with 
wonder,  they  cried  "  Excellent !  Excellent ",  and  praising 
the  two  singers,  the  virtue-loving  sages  experienced  great  joy. 
Showering  praises  on  the  brothers,  they  cried, "  How  melodiously 
you  sing!  How  exquisite  is  the  divine  poem,  the  story  of 
Rama!" 

Being  pleased  with  the  sweet  singers,  one  sage  presented  them 
with  loshtas,  another  with  delicious  fruits,  a  third  with  robes 
of  bark  and  another  with  antelope  skins  ;  some  gave  sacrificial 
thread,  some  vessels  for  collecting  alms,  others  gave  loin  cloths, 
kusha  grass,  garments  of  yellow  cloth,  scarves  and  thread  for 
binding  the  hair,  sacrificial  vessels,  rosaries  and  axes.  Others 
bestowed  their  blessings  upon  them,  saying  "  May  you  live 
long  "  and  all  acclaimed  the  author  of  the  marvellous  poem. 

They  said :  "  This  metre  will  be  the  foundation  of  the  verse 
of  future  poets ;  it  is  composed  according  to  specific  rules ; 
the  two  princes  have  sung  this  wonderful  poem  with  great  art ; 
it  will  promote  wisdom  in  those  who  listen  to  it  and  grant  them 
longevity  and  health ;  it  is  truly  able  to  charm  the  heart." 

While  the  sages  were  thus  praising  the  two  princes,  Shri 
Ramachandra,  passing  that  way,  took  them  to  his  royal  palace. 
Occupying  his  golden  throne,  Shri  Rama,  the  destroyer  of  his 
foes,  offered  hospitality  and  reverence  to  the  two  worthy  princes. 
In  the  assembly,  surrounded  by  his  ministers  and  brothers, 
Shri  Rama  looked  approvingly  on  those  handsome  and  learned 
youths,  and  addressed  the  Princes  Lakshmana,  Shatrughna 
and  Bharata  saying :  "  Hear  the  historical  poem,  which  these 
two  celestial  and  brilliant  minstrels  sing,  this  poem  which 
portrays  incidents  of  wonderful  meaning." 

Then  Shri  Rama  commanded  the  two  musicians  to  sing  and 
the  princes  tuned  their  vinas  and  chanted  the  poem  they  had 
learned,  sweetly  and  clearly.  The  whole  assembly  listened  to 
the  music  which  was  wholly  gratifying  to  the  mind  and  heart. 

Shri  Rama  said :  "  I  admire  the  music  and  the  verse  sung 
by  these  two  minstrels  who  appear  to  be  endowed  with  royal 
attributes."

In  this  way,  praised  and  encouraged  by  Shri  Ramachandra, 
the  two  brothers  demonstrating  their  skill  in  music,  sang  on. 
Listening  to  them  in  the  royal  assembly,  Shri  Ramachandra 
was  charmed. 


CHAPTER    5 

King  Dasaratka's  kingdom  and  capital 

The  earth  consisting  of  seven  islands  has  been  under  one  ruler 
since  the  time  of  those  kings  descended  from  Manu,1  who  were 
ever  victorious. 

Among  those  mighty  monarchs  was  Sagara  followed  by  his 
sixty  thousand  sons  who  hollowed  out  the  ocean.  This  classic 
Ramayana  contains  the  history  of  the  House  of  Sagara,  founded 
by  Ikshwaku.  This  Rama-Katha2  will  be  recited  from  beginning 
to  end — let  all  listen  to  it  with  faith. 

On  the  banks  of  the  river  Sarayu,  there  was  a  great  and 
prosperous  country  named  Koshala,  inhabited  by  contented 
people.  In  it  was  the  city  of  Ayodhya,  famous  in  the  three 
worlds,  founded  by  the  renowned  Manu,  a  lord  among  men. 
The  city's  thoroughfares  extended  for  sixty  miles ;  its  beauty 
was  enhanced  by  streets  admirably  planned,  the  principal 
highways  being  sprinkled  with  water  and  strewn  with  flowers. 

King  Dasaratha  protected  the  city  as  Maghavan3  protects 
Amaravati.*  He  dwelt  there  in  splendour,  as  Indra  in  heaven. 
The  dry  had  beautiful  and  massive  gates  and  charming  markets ; 
its  fortifications  were  planned  by  skilful  engineers  and  artificers. 
There  were  bards,  ballad  singers  and  public  musicians  in  the 
city;  the  inhabitants  were  wealthy  and  had  spacious  houses 
with  high  arched  porticos,  decorated  with  flags  and  banners. 
It  was  filled  with  extensive  buildings  and  beautiful  gardens,

created  by  Brahma.

and  surrounded  by  mango  groves,  tall  trees  enhancing  the 
outskirts  of  the  city,  giving  it  the  appearance  of  a  beautiful  girl 
wearing  a  girdle  of  greenery.  The  city  was  enclosed  by  strong 
fortifications  and  a  deep  moat  which  no  enemy,  by  any  expedient 
whatsoever,  could  penetrate.  Countless  elephants,  horses,  cattle, 
camels  and  mules  were  to  be  seen  in  the  city.  Innumerable 
ambassadors  and  merchants  dwelt  there  and  people  from  many 
lands  traded  peacefully  within  its  walls. 

Ayodhya,  like  Indra's  Amaravati,  was  resplendent  with  gilded 
palaces,  die  walls  of  which  were  set  with  precious  stones,  the 
domes  resembling  mountain  peaks.  Gem-encrusted,  sky-kissing 
buildings  could  be  seen  throughout  the  royal  capital.  Dwelling 
houses,  tall  and  fair,  stood  in  well-placed  sites  and  resounded 
with  delightful  music.  There  were  lovely  dwellings  occupied 
by  men  of  noble  birth,  resembling  the  aerial  chariots  that  carry 
those  of  pure  life  and  spiritual  perfection  to  heaven. 

The  warriors  living  in  that  city  were  of  those  who  do  not 
slay  a  fleeing  foe,  they  were  skilled  archers,  able  to  pierce  a  target 
by  sound  alone.  Many  had  slain  tigers,  lions  and  wolves 
wandering  near  their  homes,  either  in  single  combat  or  with 
different  kinds  of  weapons.  This  great  city  which  harboured 
thousands  of  chieftains  was  built1  by  King  Dasaratha. 

In  Ayodhya  lived  countless  learned  men  engaged  in  the 
observance  of  rituals,  there  were  also  artists  and  craftsmen,  men 
deeply  read  in  the  Veda  and  those  endowed  with  every  virtue, 
full  of  truth  and  wisdom,  as  well  as  thousands  of  seers  and  sages 
versed  in  the  mystical  science  of  Yoga. 


CHAPTER    6 

The  city  of  Ayodhya 

There  dwelt  in  that  city,  King  Dasaratha,  a  follower  of  the 
tradition  of  the  illustrious  Emperor  Manu.  The  king  was 
learned  in  the  interpretation  of  the  Vedas,  his  chief  wealth  was 

1  It  is  implied  that  Manu  founded  the  original  city  on  thii  lite,  but  leveral  cities

BALA  KANDA 
pre-eminence  in  truth  and  virtue ;  he  was  one  who  never  broke 
his  word,  who  was  ever  prudent,  majestic  and  beloved  of  his 
subjects,  a  great  charioteer,  a  worthy  descendant  of  the  dynasty 
of  Ikshwaku,  an  observer  of  many  sacrifices,  one  who  ever 
delighted  in  the  practice  of  righteousness ;  in  full  authority 
over  his  people,  equal  to  a  great  sage ;  a  royal  seer,  renowned 
in  the  three  worlds,  triumphing  over  his  enemies,  a  friend  to  all ; 
having  perfect  control  of  his  senses  and  appetites  ;  in  prosperity 
equal  to  Indra ;  in  wealth  equal  to  Kuvera, 

That  truth-loving  monarch,  striving  to  acquire  perfection  in 
virtue,  worldly  prosperity  and  happiness,  ruled  the  city  as  the 
celestial  monarch  Indra  rules  Amaravati. 

The  people  in  that  city  were  happy,  virtuous,  learned, 
experienced,  each  satisfied  with  his  state,  practising  his  own 
calling,  without  avarice  and  of  truthful  speech.  None  was 
indigent  or  dwelt  in  a  mean  habitation ;  all  lived  happily  with 
their  families,  possessing  wealth,  grain,  cattle  and  horses.  In 
that  city  of  Ayodhya,  none  was  a  miser  or  a  swindler,  none  was 
mean-spirited,  proud,  rash,  worthless  or  an  atheist.  Men  and 
women  were  of  righteous  conduct,  fully  self-controlled,  and  in 
their  pure  and  chaste  behaviour  they  equalled  the  great  sages. 
None  lacked  earrings,  coronets  and  necklaces.  They  bathed 
daily  and  rubbed  their  bodies  with  oil,  using  attar  of  roses  and 
sandal  paste.  None  ate  impure  food,  none  allowed  his  neighbour 
to  suffer  hunger.  All  possessed  ornaments  and  gold,  and  there 
was  none  who  had  not  learnt  to  subdue  his  mind.  No  one 
in  the  city  neglected  to  offer  butter  and  fragrant  objects  in  the 
sacrificial  fire.  No  one  was  mean,  impious  or  failed  to  discharge  his 
duties ;  there  were  no  thieves  and  none  were  born  of  mixed  castes. 

The  brahmins  were  devoted  to  their  respective  duties,  firm 
in  self-control  and  authorized  to  accept  gifts.  None  denied 
the  existence  of  God,  none  uttered  falsehood  or  were  enamoured 
of  worldly  pleasure  and  none  was  guilty  of  slander.  No  brahmin 
was  unversed  in  the  six  systems  of  philosophy  nor  did  any 
neglect  to  fast  at  the  full  moon,  or  on  other  appointed  days ; 
there  were  none  who  suffered  from  mental  or  physical  infirmities 
and  none  were  unhappy  in  that  city. 

Among  the  inhabitants,  there  were  no  revolutionaries  and 
none  who  were  not  loyal  to  king  and  state.    Those  who  dwelt 
19 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 
there,  worshipped  the  gods  and  the  uninvited  guest ;  they  were 
both  magnanimous  and  charitable. 

All  attained  a  ripe  age  as  virtuous  and  truth-loving  people ; 
their  homes  were  filled  with  children,  grandchildren  and  virtuous 
women.  The  warriors  were  subject  to  the  learned  brahmins 
and  the  merchants  to  the  warrior  caste ;  in  accordance  with 
their  caste  the  people  served  the  brahmins,  the  warriors  and 
the  merchants. 

In  the  administration  of  the  empire,  the  Emperor  Dasaratha 
followed  the  example  of  the  first  ruler  Mama  who  was  supreme 
in  wisdom  and  a  god  among  men. 

Ayodhya  abounded  in  warriors,  undefeated  in  battle,  fearless 
and  skilful  in  the  use  of  arms,  resembling  lions  guarding  their 
mountain  caves. 

There  were  horses  in  the  city  from  Kamroja,  Vanaya,  Nudi 
and  Vahli,  and  elephants  from  the  regions  of  Vindhu  and  Hrmavat. 

The  city  of  Ayodhya  was  full  of  courageous  and  noble  men 
belonging  to  the  races  of  Bhadra,  Mulla  and  Mriga,  inhabitants 
of  the  regions  of  Binchyachala  and  the  Himalayan  ranges. 

The  city  possessed  mighty  elephants  like  great  hills.  That 
capital  was  truly  worthy  of  the  name  '  Ayodhya,'  which  means 
"  The  city  none  can  challenge  in  warfare  ". 

Dwelling  there,  the  Emperor  Dasaratha,  ruling  the  kingdom, 
resembled  the  moon  in  the  midst  of  countless  stars.  That 
great  king,  equal  to  Indra  himself,  reigned  over  the  city, 
guarded  by  fortifications  and  ramparts,  a  city  which  contained 
innumerable  dwellings  of  many  kinds  and  thousands  of  prosper-' 
ous  inhabitants.

The  administration  of  the  kingdom 

Ever  devoted  to  the  welfare  of  King  Dasaratha,  the  ministers 
of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku  were  possessed  of  all  the  virtues ; 
their  counsels  were  based  on  truth  and  they  understood  the 
import  of  the  royal  commands  immediately. 
20 


BALA    KANDA 

Eight  of  the  long's  counsellors  were  famed;  untiringly 
employed  in  the  affairs  of  state,  they  were  honest  and  devoted 
to  the  cultivation  of  virtue.  Their  names  were  Dhristi,  Jayanta, 
Vijaja,  Siddhartha,  Atyartha-Sadaka,  Ashoka,  Mantra-pala  and 
Sumantra. 

The  great  and  holy  sages,  Vasishtha  and  Vamadeva  assisted 
the  king  in  his  observance  of  spiritual  duties  and  also  acted  as 
his  advisers. 

All  the  ministers  were  virtuous,  scorning  to  do  wrong, 
benevolent,  versed  in  the  moral  law,  of  wide  experience,  dis- 
interested, magnanimous,  acquainted  with  the  spirit  of  the 
scriptures,  forbearing,  patient,  obedient  to  the  king,  true  to  their 
word,  cheerful,  free  from  avarice  and  well  acquainted  with  the 
affairs  of  their  fellow  subjects  and  with  those  of  the  subjects 
of  other  monarchs.  They  were  efficient,  firm  in  friendship, 
and  even  passed  judgment  on  their  own  sons  if  they  broke 
the  law. 

These  counsellors  were  expert  in  the  science  of  economics  and 
warfare,  and  never  inflicted  unmerited  punishment  on  an  enemy. 
They  were  brave  and  unambitious.  Conversant  with  every 
branch  of  political  life,  they  protected  all  those  who  lived  in 
the  state.  Adding  to  the  royal  treasury  without  burdening  the 
learned  and  the  warriors,  they  inflicted  penalties  on  wrongdoers 
with  due  regard  to  their  capacity  for  bearing  it.  These  ministers 
were  pure  of  heart  and  of  chaste  conduct.  None  consorted 
with  his  neighbour's  wife,  none  were  wicked  and  all  lived 
together  peaceably.  Cultivating  every  good  quality  and  prac- 
tising the  various  arts,  they  were  renowned  for  their  courage, 
their  fair  name  was  published  abroad  and  their  lives  were  guided 
by  reason.  Skilled  in  the  laws  of  the  country  and  blessed  with 
wealth,  they  issued  wise  edicts  and  exercised  their  minds  in 
philosophical  debate. 

Acquainted  with  the  moral  code,  they  conversed  affectionately 
with  each  other ;  such  were  King  Dasaratha's  ministers  who, 
informed  by  their  agents  of  the  needs  of  the  people,  satisfied 
them  and  governed  with  prudence. 

In  the  administration  of  his  kingdom,  the  king  never  permitted 
unrighteousness  to  cause  dissension,  and  became  known  through- 
out the  world  as  an  ocean  of  truth.    That  lion  among  men

King  Dasaratha,  reigning  over  the  earth,  had  none  superior 
or  equal  to  himself.  Honoured  by  his  feudal  lords,  surrounded 
by  friends,  King  Dasaratha,  like  Indra,  reigned  in  majesty. 
Benevolent,  powerful,  accomplished  and  gracious,  King 
Dasaratha  protected  Ayodhya  and  shone  in  splendour  like  the 
sun  illumining  the  world. 


CHAPTER    8 

The  king  desires  to  perform  a  sacrifice  for  the  birth  of  a  son 

King  Dasaratha,  that  glorious  and  righteous  king,  though 
performing  great  austerities,  was  without  an  heir  to  the  throne. 
Then  the  wise  and  great-souled  monarch  said  to  himself :  "  I 
will  perform  the  horse-sacrifice  (Aswa-medha)1  in  order  to  have 
a  son." 

Having  thus  decided,  the  supremely  sagacious  sovereign 
convened  a  meeting  of  his  counsellors  and  addressing  his  chief 
minister,  Sumantra,  commanded  him  as  follows :  "  Send 
speedily  for  the  spiritual  preceptors  and  priests."  Quick  to  act, 
Sumantra  at  once  summoned  those  highly  learned  preceptors 
and  brought  thither  Suyagna,  Vamadeva,  Javali,  Kasyapa 
and  Vasishtha  together  with  other  eminent  priests  and 
brahmins. 

Having  offered  salutations  to  these  holy  men,  King  Dasaratha, 
speaking  in  gracious  accents,  uttered  words  full  of  truth  and 
purpose :  He  said,  "O  Sages,  I  have  practised  virtue  and  yet 
I  have  not  had  the  good  fortune  to  be  blessed  with  a  son ; 
it  is  therefore  my  intention  to  perform  the  horse-sacrifice.  I 
wish  to  act  according  to  the  injunction  of  the  scriptures ;  you, 
O  Holy  Men,  advise  me  after  due  deliberation  as  to  how  I  can 
be  successful  in  the  proposed  undertaking  ".

A  hone,  being  consecrated  by  certain  ceremonies,  was  let  loose  and  allowed 
to  wander  at  will  followed  by  warriors  ;  the  ruler  of  any  country  the  animal 
entered  was  bound  to  fight  or  submit ;  finally  the  horse  was  sacrificed  with 
special  rite*. 

22 


BALA    KANDA 

The  learned  brahmins,  led  by  Shri  Vasishtha,  praised  the 
king's  intention  and  said :  "  Thou  hast  decided  on  the  proper 
course,  O  King."  Highly  pleased,  they  commanded  those 
things  requisite  for  the  sacrifice  to  be  assembled  and  the  horse 
loosed.  They  said,  "  O  King,  let  a  place  of  sacrifice  be 
chosen  on  the  north  bank  of  the  river  Sarayu.  O  King, 
this  holy  resolve  formed  by  thee,  for  the  sake  of  an  heir,  will 
assuredly  bring  the  fulfilment  of  thy  desire  ". 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  brahmins,  the  monarch  rejoiced  and 
commanded  his  ministers  to  bring  the  sacrificial  appointments 
and  release  the  horse  under  the  protection  of  the  warriors  j1 
they  were  also  directed  to  erect  a  sacrificial  pavilion  on  the  bank 
of  the  river  Sarayu.  He  further  decreed  the  adoption  of  those 
measures  which  would  dimmish  the  possibility  of  hindrance  to 
the  sacrifice,  for  even  for  kings,  the  horse-sacrifice  was  not  easily 
performed. 

The  king  said :  "  Let  it  be  remembered  that  during  the 
observance  of  the  sacrifice,  no  suffering  must  be  inflicted  on  any, 
lest  some  perverse  and  crafty  brahmin  should  cause  obstruction 
in  the  proceedings.  By  carrying  through  the  ritual  without 
regard  for  scriptural  injunctions,  it  comes  to  nought ;  therefore, 
bring  the  sacrifice  to  a  successful  conclusion.  I  depend  on  you, 
and  expect  you  to  carry  the  sacrifice  through  to  a  successful 
issue." 

The  counsellors  replied,  saying, "  O  King,  be  it  so  ". 

Blessing  the  monarch,  the  learned  brahmins  retired,  and  the 
king  addressed  his  ministers  saying :  "  Prepare  the  sacrifice  as 
the  officiating  priests  have  instructed  you  and  accept  responsibil- 
ity for  its  final  success." 

Then  the  illustrious  sovereign  left  the  court  and  entered  his 
private  apartments  where  the  queens  dwelt,  who  loved  the  king 
from  the  depths  of  their  hearts. 

King  Dasaratha  addressed  them,  saying :  "  I  intend  to  observe 
a  sacrifice  for  the  sake  of  obtaining  a  son,  do  you  all  follow 
die  prescribed  discipline."  The  queens  rejoiced  to  hear  these 
words  from  the  lips  of  the  king  and  their  lotus-like  faces 
brightened  like  flowers  on  the  departure  of  the  cold  season.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    9 

Sumanira  relates  a  tradition  that  a  son  will  be  born 
through  the  help  of  the  Sage  Risky  asringa 

Sumantra,  having  heard  of  the  preparations  tor  the  sacrifice, 
obtained  a  private  audience  with  his  sovereign  and  said :  "  I 
have  heard  of  a  tradition,  formerly  related  to  me  by  the  august 
brahmins.  O  King,  in  ancient  days,  the  blessed  Sanatkumara 
predicted  to  the  holy  sages  around  him  that  a  son  would  be 
born  to  thee. 

It  was  prophesied  that  a  son  of  Kasyapa,  named  Vibhandaka 
would  have  a  son  called  Rishyasringa  and  that  he  should  dwell 
in  the  forest  alone  with  his  saintly  father,  unknown  to  any  other 
man  or  woman. 

This  sage  would  keep  the  twofold  vow  of  brahmacharya 
enjoined  by  the  sages.  In  this  way  he  would  pass  a  long  time 
worshipping  God  through  the  fire-sacrifice  and  the  service  of 
his  sire. 

In  the  country  named  Anga,  a  famous  king  named  Lomapada, 
would  oppress  the  people  by  his  evil  way  of  life  and  thus  cause 
a  drought.  On  account  of  this,  the  king  would  suffer  great 
affliction  and  summoning  the  brahmins  would  say  to  them: 
"  O  Wise  Men,  acquainted  as  you  are  with  the  customs  of  the 
world  and  also  the  divine  laws,  tell  me  what  ritual  of  purification 
and  repentance  I  can  adopt  to  expiate  my  evil  deeds,  which 
have  brought  about  this  drought." 

Then  the  brahmins,  learned  in  the  Veda,  would  answer  the 
king  thus :  "  O  King,  exert  thyself  by  every  means  to  bring 
the  son  of  the  Sage  Vibhandaka  hither.  Having  with  due 
reverence  conveyed  him  hither,  do  thou  confer  thy  daughter 
Shanta  on  him  in  marriage." 

The  king  having  listened  to  their  words  and  reflected  on  how 
he  should  bring  that  excellent  sage  to  the  court,  would  then 
request  his  ministers  and  priests  to  approach  the  sage,  but  they 
would  declare  their  unwillingness  to  undertake  the  mission* 
being  afraid  of  the  rishi's  power. 
In  order  to  avoid  the  monarch's  displeasure,  however,  after 


BALA    KANDA 

deliberating  on  the  method  by  which  the  sage  could  be  brought 
to  the  court,  they  would  make  the  following  proposal :  "  By 
the  courtesans  can  the  sage  be  persuaded  to  come  to  the  king's 
court,  the  rains  will  then  follow  and  the  drought  will  be  at  an 
end.  Then  will  the  king  join  his  daughter  in  marriage  to  the 
sage.  By  pouring  oblations  into  the  sacrificial  fire  the  illustrious 
sage,  Rishyasringa,  will,  by  his  grace,  obtain  the  desired  son 
for  King  Dasaratha." 

"  Thus  spoke  the  illustrious  Sanatkumara,  in  the  midst  of 
the  sages,  and  I  have  now  recounted  it  to  thee." 

King  Dasaratha  was  delighted  to  hear  these  words,  and 
requested  the  minister  to  describe  further  how  King  Lomapada 
brought  the  sage  to  his  court 


CHAPTER     10 

He  describes  horn  Rishyasringa  was  brought  to  King 
Lomapada's  court 

Thus  requested,  Sumantra  began  to  narrate  the  story  in  detail 
and  said :  "  O  Great  King,  hear  how  the  ministers  brought 
the  Sage  Rishyasringa  to  the  court. 

"  The  ministers  addressed  King  Lomapada  saying  :  *  We  have 
a  plan  whereby  the  young  sage  may  be  conveyed  hither 
successfully.  He  resides  in  the  forest,  devoted  to  holy  study, 
spiritual  practices  and  asceticism,  and  is  wholly  unacquainted 
with  the  pursuit  of  pleasure. 

'* '  By  the  means  of  those  things  gratifying  to  the  senses, 
we  shall  most  certainly  be  able  to  bring  the  sage  to  the  court. 
Let  beautifully-attired  and  lovely  courtesans  go  there  and  by 
their  acts,  charm  and  bring  him  hither '." 

The  king  approved  the  plan  and  commanded  his  ministers 
to  carry  it  out. 

The  courtesans  then  entered  the  forest  and  took  up  their 
abode  near  the  hermitage,  seeking  a  meeting  with  the  young 
sage.  Protected  by  his  father,  the  youthful  ascetic  seldom 
*5 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

passed  the  boundaries  of  the  hermitage,  nor  had  he  seen  any 
man  or  woman  beyond  its  precincts. 

One  day,  impelled  by  destiny,  the  youth  went  forth  from 
the  hermitage  and  beheld  the  graceful  and  beautiful  women, 
attired  in  many-coloured  robes  of  exquisite  design,  singing 
sweetly.  They  approached  the  son  of  Rishi  Vibhandaka  and 
addressed  him,  saying :  "Who  art  thou?  Whose  son  art  thou  ? 
What  is  thy  name?  Why  dost  thou  dwell  in  the  dark 
forest  ?  " 

Never  having  beheld  women  of  beauty  and  charm  before, 
Rishyasringa  was  captivated  and  answered  them,  saving :  "  My 
father  is  the  great  Sage  Vibhandaka  of  the  family  of  Kasyapa 
and  I  am  his  son,  my  name  is  Rishyasringa.  O  Beautiful  Beings 
of  charming  mien,  my  hermitage  is  near  at  hand,  please  come 
thither  and  allow  me  to  oner  you  hospitality  there." 

The  courtesans  accepted  the  invitation  and  accompanied  the 
sage  who  received  them  in  the  traditional  manner,  placing  before 
them  water  to  wash  their  feet  and  delicious  roots  and  fruits. 

Fearing  the  father's  return  and  anxious  to  depart  with  all  haste, 
the  courtesans  plied  the  young  sage  with  tasty  confections 
which  they  had  brought  with  them,  saying :  "  Be  pleased  to 
accept  these  dainties  which  we  have  brought  for  thee  to  enjoy 
on  this  occasion."  They  then  caressed  the  youth,  feeding  him 
with  sweets  and  other  delicacies. 

The  resplendent  sage  partook  of  the  offerings,  thinking  them 
to  be  fruits,  never  having  tasted  any  other  food. 

The  courtesans,  fearing  the  father's  return,  pretended  to  be 
fasting  and  left  the  hermitage.  At  their  departure,  the  youth- 
ful sage  felt  dejected  and  restless. 

The  following  day,  the  courtesans,  charmingly  attired,  again 
went  to  the  hermitage  and  smiled  on  perceiving  the  young  sage 
appear  so  disconsolate.  They  then  approached  him  and  said  : 
"  O  Handsome  Youth,  to-day  please  grace  our  hermitage  with 
thy  presence.  O  Auspicious  One,  we  can  entertain  thee  better 
there  than  here." 

The  young  sage  agreed  to  accompany  them  and  went  with 
them  to  their  abode.  As  the  sage  entered  the  city,  Indra 
showered  rain  on  the  domain  of  King  Lomapada  and  the  people 
rejoiced.

When  the  tain  began  to  fall,  King  Lomapada,  realising  that 
the  holy  sage  had  entered  the  city,  went  out  to  meet  him. 
Offering  him  humble  and  loving  salutations,  he  presented  him 
with  the  traditional  gifts  (arghya)1  of  water  and  food,  and 
entreated  him  to  grant  the  boon  that  bis  father  Vibhandaka 
should  not  visit  his  displeasure  on  him. 

The  king  then  took  the  youth  to  the  inner  apartments  and 
united  him  in  marriage  to  his  daughter  Shanta. 

Deeply  revered  by  the  king,  Rishyasringa  lived  happily  in 
the  capital  with  bis  bride,  the  Princess  Shanta. 


chapter    zi

Sumantra  said :  "  O  Great  King,  hearken  further  to  the  words 
of  the  great  Sage  Sanatkumara : — 

"  '  In  the  House  of  Ikshwaku,  there  will  be  a  highly  righteous 
and  truth-loving  king  named  Dasaratha  who  will  form  an  alliance 
with  King  Lomapada  of  Anga. 

"  *  King  Dasaratha  will  approach  his  friend  Lomapada  and 
beg  the  assistance  of  Rishyasringa,  the  husband  of  the  Princess 
Shanta,  in  the  performance  of  the  sacrifice  he  desires  to  observe, 
that  he  may  be  blessed  with  a  son.  After  mature  consideration, 
King  Lomapada  will  permit  Shanta's  lord,  Rishyasringa  to 
accompany  King  Dasaratha.  Highly  gratified,  King  Dasaratha 
will  return  to  his  capital  with  Rishyasringa  and  will  ask  the  sage 
to  officiate  at  the  sacrifice  he  is  about  to  perform  in  order  to 
obtain  sons  and  also  a  future  abode  in  the  celestial  regions. 

"  'As  a  result  of  the  sacrifice,  King  Dasaratha  will  have  four 
sons,  each  of  limitless  valour.  These  sons  will  be  renowned 
throughout  the  world  and  will  increase  the  glory  of  their 
dynasty.'

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  This  story  was  narrated  by  the  Sage  Sanatkumara  in  the 
first  quarter  of  Satya-Yuga.1  O  Great  King !  Thou  shouldst 
approach  Rishyasringa  with  a  worthy  chariot  and  retinue,  and 
bring  him  with  ceremony  to  thy  capital." 

Having  heard  the  good  counsel  of  his  minister  Sumantra, 
the  King  commanded  him  to  inform  his  Guru  Vasishtha  of 
this  matter,  and  the  holy  Vasishtha  acquiesced  in  the  plan. 

Then  the  king,  with  firm  resolve,  attended  by  his  queens, 
counsellors  and  priests,  prepared  to  set  forth  for  the  city  where 
Rishyasringa  dwelt.  Passing  through  various  forests  and 
traversing  many  rivers,  the  king  arrived  at  Lomapada's  capital. 
There  he  beheld  the  resplendent  sage,  in  lustre  like  a  glowing 
fire,  seated  near  King  Lomapada. 

Inspired  by  friendship,  the  great  monarch  Lomapada  offered 
respectful  salutations  to  King  Dasaratha  and  informed  Rishyas- 
ringa of  his  alliance  with  this  king,  whereupon  the  sage  expressed 
his  approval  in  words  of  praise. 

Having  enjoyed  the  hospitality  of  King  Lomapada  for  seven 
days,  King  Dasaratha  addressed  him  thus :  "  O  King,  I  desire 
to  enter  upon  an  important  undertaking,  be  gracious  enough 
to  allow  thy  daughter  Shanta  and  her  lord  to  return  to  my 
capital  to  assist  me." 

Hearing  these  words,  King  Lomapada  replied :  "  Be  it  so," 
and  turning  to  the  sage  said  :  "  Be  pleased  to  go  with  thy  wife 
to  the  capital  of  King  Dasaratha." 

The  youthful  sage  assented  to  the  command  of  King  Loma- 
pada, and  he,  in  company  with  his  spouse,  departed  with  King 
Dasaratha. 

Having  taken  leave  of  his  friend,  King  Dasaratha  despatched 
speedy  messengers  to  go  before  him  to  instruct  his  ministers 
to  prepare  for  their  arrival. 

The  people  of  Ayodhya  carried  out  all  as  they  had  been 
commanded  and  overjoyed  at  the  monarch's  return,  fulfilled 
the  instructions  of  his  messengers.  The  citizens  were  delighted 
to  behold  the  young  sage  entering  the  city  and  being  honoured 
by  the  king,  as  Indra  in  heaven  pays  tribute  to  Kasyapa.

enjoined  in  the  scriptures. 

The  royal  ladies  also  welcomed  the  wide-eyed  Shanta  with 
her  lord  to  the  private  apartments,  and  expressed  their  pleasure 
and  delight. 

Honoured  and  worshipped  by  the  queens,  no  less  than  by

Rishyasringa  agrees  to  assist  in  the  sacrifice 

Time  passed  and  the  spring  came  again  while  the  holy  sage 
was  at  the  court  of  King  Dasaratha.  On  a  propitious  day, 
the  king  decided  to  enter  upon  the  sacrifice. 

He  approached  Rishyasringa  and,  bowing  low,  offered  saluta- 
tions to  him,  inviting  that  god-like  sage  to  assist  in  the  sacrifice 
he  was  observing,  to  preserve  the  dynasty.  The  sage  agreed 
and  requested  the  king  to  provide  the  necessary  material  for  the 
sacrifice  and  to  let  loose  the  horse. 

The  sovereign  commanded  his  minister  Sumantra  to  summon 
with  all  speed  the  priests  acquainted  with  the  philosophy  of 
the  Veda,  and  sent  invitations  to  the  sages  Vamadeva,  Javali, 
Kasyapa,  the  high  priest  Vasishtha  and  other  exalted  and  learned 
brahmins. 

Sumantra,  setting  out  in  haste,  approached  the  sages  court- 
eously and  brought  them  to  the  king.  The  virtuous  monarch, 
after  paying  respectful  homage  to  them,  addressed  them  humbly, 
speaking  words  full  of  candour  and  integrity. 

He  said :  "  O  Sages,  despite  my  ardent  desire  to  have  an  heir, 
I  am  without  one.  I  have,  therefore,  decided  to  perform  the 
horse  sacrifice  to  that  end.  I  desire  the  sacrifice  to  be  observed 
according  to  the  scriptural  laws  and  through  the  grace  of  the 
Sage  Rishyasringa,  I  hope  to  attain  my  purpose."

articles  and  to  release  the  horse. 

They  said  :  "  Righteous  is  thy  desire  to  be  blessed  with  a 
son ;  O  King,  thou  shall  surely  obtain  four  illustrious  sons  of 
limitless  valour." 

The  brahmins'  words  convinced  the  king  that  heirs  would  be 
granted  to  him  and  he  communicated  his  satisfaction  to  his 
ministers.  He  said :  "  O  Counsellors,  bring  together  four  high 
priests  and  set  the  horse  at  liberty  under  the  protection  of  four 
hundred  warriors.  Let  a  sacrificial  pavilion  be  set  up  on  the 
bank  of  the  river  Sarayu,  and  let  appropriate  protective  rites 
be  observed  lest  obstructions  arise." 

The  king  then  ordained  that  during  the  period  of  sacrifice 
neither  priests  nor  other  persons  should  be  subject  to  any 
suffering  whatsoever.  He  said :  "  In  such  rites,  others  have 
been  impeded  by  sub-human  beings,  which  has  resulted  in  the 
annulment  of  the  sacrifice.  You  should,  therefore,  employ 
every  means  to  bring  the  sacrifice  to  a  successful  con- 
clusion." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  king,  the  ministers— highly  gratified 
— began  to  act  according  to  bis  instructions.  Then  the  brahmins 
assured  the  king  that  the  sacrifice  would  be  accomplished 
without  hindrance  and  offering  him  obeisance,  returned  to  their 
homes. 

The  brahmins  having  departed,  the  king  bade  farewell  to 
his  ministers  and  entered  his  private  apartments. 


CHAPTER     13 

The  Sacrifice  is  commenced 

The  following  year,  spring  having  returned  once  more,  the  king, 
desiring  to  complete  the  sacrifice  for  the  sake  of  an  heir,  paid 
homage  to  Shri  Vasishtha,  offering  him  humble  salutations 
according  to  the  prescribed  ordinance,  and  addressed  that  great 
brahmin  with  submission,  saying : —

BALA    KANDA 

"  O  Great  Sage,  be  pleased  to  complete  the  holy  ceremony 
according  to  the  sacred  tradition.  Let  it  be  so  undertaken  that 
no  interference  may  take  place.  Thou  art  compassionate  and 
thy  heart  is  inclined  towards  me.  Thou  art  also  my  Guru, 
the  burden  of  the  sacrifice  must  be  borne  by  thee." 

The  most  excellent  sage  replied,  "  Be  it  so.  I  will  do  as 
thou  desirest." 

Hereafter,  Shri  Vasishtha  summoned  those  brahmins,. able 
to  perform  the  holy  rituals  and  also  artificers,  architects,  writers, 
actors  and  dancers. 

Addressing  the  learned  priests,  he  said :  "At  the  king's 
command,  inaugurate  the  great  sacrifice.  Cause  bricks  in 
thousands  to  be  brought  hither  with  all  speed  and  erect  many 
kinds  of  dwellings,  well  arranged,  furnished  with  food  and 
every  comfort  to  accommodate  royal  and  other  guests.  Prepare 
hundreds  of  beautiful  houses  on  suitable  sites,  together  with 
provisions  and  all  things  needed  by  brahmins ;  erect  also  large 
buildings  for  the  people  of  other  lands,  and  store  food  and 
articles  of  comfort  where  it  is  best  to  do  so.  Fine  and  well- 
equipped  houses  should  be  built  for  villagers.  Ensure  that 
hospitality  in  the  form  of  food  and  refreshment  be  given  with 
courtesy  and  kindness.  Those  attending  the  sacrifice  should 
be  entertained  with  respect  and  consideration,  being  received 
in  a  becoming  manner,  according  to  their  caste.  Let  no  affront 
be  offered  to  any  through  greed,  anger  or  lust.  Let  craftsmen 
and  servants  be  suitably  regarded,  so  that  their  hearts  be  set 
on  their  task  and  let  no  one  act  disruptively.  Treat  all  in 
a  spirit  of  goodwill  and  courtesy,  ,so  that  the  work  may  be 
successfully  accomplished." 

The  people  listened  to  the  holy  sage  and  answered,  "  We 
will  act  according  to  thy  instructions,  O  Sage,  nothing  shall 
be  omitted." 

Shri  Vasishtha  then  summoned  the  chief  minister  Sumantra 
and  said :  "  Send  out  invitations  to  the  sacrifice  to  all  the 
righteous  kings  of  the  earth  and  also  the  brahmins,  kshatriyas, 
vaishyas  and  shudras  of  every  country,  but  go  first  to  the  great 
Sovereign  of  Mithila,  the  heroic  Janaka,  eminent  in  truth,  the 
greatest  of  warriors  and  a  knower  of  the  Veda,  since  he  is  an 
ancient  ally  of  King  Dasaratha.    Thereafter,  bring  the  ever-

and  then  the  aged  and  virtuous  King  of  Kaikeya,  our  sovereign's 
father-in-law,  and  invite  his  son  also.  Call  the  fortunate  King 
Lomapada  of  Anga,  the  intimate  friend  of  the  King,  and  bring 
hither,  with  respect,  Koshala,  the  King  of  Magadha. 

"  Thereafter,  send  messengers  to  the  kings  of  the  eastern 
countries  of  Sindhu,  Souriva,  and  Sourashtra,  and  the  monarchs 
of  the  south,  with  other  great  kings  of  the  earth ;  let  them  come 
with  their  brothers,  relations,  retainers  and  servants." 

Having  heard  the  words  of  Shri  Vasishtha,  Sumantra  carried 
out  the  instructions  given  by  him,  dispatching  invitations  by 
special  messengers  to  the  monarchs  of  many  lands,  himself  going 
forth  to  escort  some  of  the  great  kings. 

Sumantra  having  departed,  all  the  workers  employed  in  the 
sacrifice  informed  the  holy  sage  of  their  progress,  and  he  advised 
them  further  saying :  "  Let  nothing  be  presented  to  any 
without  due  respect,  even  in  jest ;  gifts  given  with  contempt 
lead  to  the  destruction  of  the  giver." 

A  few  days  later,  the  kings  from  afar  arrived  at  the  sacrificial 
pavilion  bearing  gifts  of  gems. 

Then  Shri  Vasishtha,  being  pleased,  said :  "  O  King,  at  thy 
command,  all  the  kings  have  come  and  been  received  by  me 
with  due  hospitality.  The  preparations  for  the  sacrifice  are 
now  completed,  be  pleased  to  enter  the  sacrificial  pavilion  and 
inspect  the  articles  needed  for  the  ceremony.  See  how  well 
thy  servants  have  furnished  everything  requisite  and  have 
gratified  thy  every  wish." 

On  the  recommendation  of  the  Sage  Vasishtha  and  Rishyas- 
ringa,  King  Dasaratha  went  to  the  sacrificial  ground  at  an 
auspicious  time,  when  a  propitious  star  was  in  the  ascendant. 
Then  the  learned  brahmins  and  Shri  Vasishtha  elected  Rishyas- 
ringa  as  chief  priest. 

The  sacrifice  began  in  accordance  with  the  ancient  ordinance 
and  the  king,  with  his  queens,  engaged  in  the  preUminary 
initiations.

CHAPTER     14 

The  Ceremonies  are  performed  with  the  appropriate  rites 

Having  ranged  far  and  wide  during  a  year,  the  horse  returned 
and  on  the  bank  of  the  river  Sarayu  the  sacrifice  of  King 
Dasaratha  continued.  The  chief  priests,  under  Rishyasringa, 
assisted  the  king  in  the  observance  of  the  rituals.  Brahmins 
learned  in  the  ancient  science,  also  officiated  and  assisted  the  king 
according  to  the  instructions  laid  down  in  the  Kalpa  Sutra. 

The  two  special  portions  of  the  sacrifice  Pravargya  and 
Upasada  were  duly  observed ;  then  the  brahmins  worshipped 
the  gods  with  joy.  The  illustrious  sage  performed  certain  rituals 
and  offered  India  the  part  of  the  sacrifice  due  to  him.  There- 
after all  partook  of  the  soma-juice  which  destroys  every  sin. 

The  high-souled  king  duly  undertook  the  third  portion  of 
the  ceremony  with  the  assistance  of  the  holy  brahmins.  In 
the  sacrifice,  no  oblation  was  omitted  and  none  wrongly  offered 
in  the  sacred  fire.  All  that  was  done  was  correctly  carried  out 
under  the  supervision  of  the  sages. 

During  the  period  of  sacrifice,  no  brahmin  experienced  hunger 
or  thirst.  Countless  priests  were  present  and  each  was  attended 
by  hundreds  of  disciples.  Workers,  servants  and  other  classes 
were  feasted  like  the  brahmins,  and  monks  and  ascetics  were 
provided  for  abundantly. 

The  aged,  the  children,  and  the  women  were  served  with  all 
they  cared  to  eat,  and  those  who  attended  on  them  were  willing 
and  pleasant. 

By  the  king's  command,  apparel,  money  and  other  gifts  were 
freely  distributed  with  immeasurable  generosity.  Mountains 
of  cooked  and  uncooked  foods  were  to  be  seen  and  each  could 
have  what  he  required,  to  suit  his  needs.  Men  and  women 
from  many  lands  were  daily  entertained  with  food  and  drink. 
From  every  side,  the  king  heard  the  exclamations  "How  delicious 
is  the  food,  we  are  well  content ". 

Servants  and  retainers  gorgeously  clad  and  wearing  golden 
earrings,  attended  on  the  brahmins,  while  others  adorned  with 
jewels  served  other  castes. 

33 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

In  the  interval  between  the  two  parts  of  the  sacrifice,  eloquent 
and  learned  pundits  debated  metaphysical  problems  and  vied 
with  each  other  in  the  display  of  wisdom  and  acumen. 

Day  by  day,  the  sacrificial  ceremonies  were  carried  out  by 
learned  and  holy  priests.  There  were  none  assisting  at  the 
holy  ritual  who  were  illiterate  or  unacquainted  with  the  Vedas. 

Each  attendant  of  the  king  was  inspired  by  exalted  principles 
and  all  were  highly  eloquent  and  deeply  versed  in  the  scriptures. 

Eighteen  pillars  of  wood  were  set  up  in  the  place  of  sacrifice, 
each  made  of  a  different  kind  of  timber.  Priests,  skilled  in 
the  art  of  sacrificial  rites,  overlaid  them  with  gold.  Each  of  the 
eighteen  columns  was  twenty-one  feet  in  height,  polished  and 
of  octangular  shape  and  all  were  firmly  fixed  in  the  earth 
and  covered  with  embroidered  cloths.  In  addition,  they  were 
adorned  with  sandalwood  and  flowers  and  looked  as  beautiful 
as  the  constellation  of  the  seven  sages,1  in  the  sky.  Sacrificial 
pits  were  constructed  by  master  masons  and  the  fire  kindled 
by  brahmins. 

The  sacrificial  pit  prepared  for  King  Dasaratha  was  formed 
like  a  great  eagle  in  gold,  its  wings  set  with  gems. 

The  beasts  to  be  sacrificed  to  each  particular  deity  were  bound 
according  to  scriptural  injunction.  There  were  birds,  snakes 
and  horses,  and  according  to  tradition,  the  chief  priest  bound 
the  aquatic  animals,  such  as  turtles,  in  the  sacrificial  pavilion. 
Three  hundred  beasts  and  the  horse  which  had  roamed  over 
the  earth  were  assembled. 

Queen  Kaushalya  joyfully  paid  reverence  to  the  horse  before 
making  the  sacrifice  with  three  strokes  of  the  sword.  Prompted 
by  righteous  desire,  Queen  Kaushalya  passed  the  night  watching 
over  the  dead  body  of  the  horse,  then  the  priests  caused  the 
king's  serving  women  and  the  courtesans  to  approach  it. 

The  twice-born  of  subdued  senses  cooked  the  fat  of  the  horse 
on  the  fire  in  the  manner  prescribed  by  the  shastra.  King 
Dasaratha  inhaling  the  odour  emitted  by  the  fat,  acknowledged 
and  expiated  his  sins.  Sixteen  assistant  priests  made  offerings 
of  parts  of  the  horse  into  the  fire,  in  spoons  fashioned  of  cane, 
plaksha  wood  being  used  in  other  sacrifices.    At  the  horse

sacrifice,  three  days  of  special  rituals  are  observed :  during  the 
first  day  the  Agmstona  is  performed ;  during  the  second  day, 
the  Uktha  rite,  during  the  third  day  the  Atiratra  rite.  The 
great  sacrificial  acts  named  Jyotishtoma,  Agnisktona,  Atiratas3 
Abhijit,  Vishnajit  and  Aptoryama  are  also  observed. 

King  Dasaratha,  the  promoter  of  his  dynasty,  on  the  conclu- 
sion of  the  sacrifice,  gave  away  four  parts  of  his  kingdom,  as 
dakshina1  to  the  four  priests.  The  king  distributed  alms 
following  the  great  example  of  Swayambhumanu  of  old.  The 
sacrifice  being  concluded,  that  great  monarch  gave  large  portions 
of  the  earth  in  charity,  to  the  officiating  priests,  and  finally  that 
magnanimous  sovereign  bestowed  the  whole  kingdom  on  the 
assisting  priests. 

Then  the  holy  brahmins  addressed  that  sinless  monarch, 
saying  :  "  O  Lord  of  Men,  we  are  not  able  to  protect,  defend 
and  administer  this  vast  empire,  for  we  have  dedicated  ourselves 
to  holy  study.  Therefore,  O  Great  King,  we  render  back  these 
lands  to  thee,  grant  us  in  return  some  lesser  gift,  be  it  gems, 
gold  or  coins  to  help  us  in  our  hermitages." 

Thus  addressed  by  the  learned  brahmins,  the  king  bestowed 
on  them  a  hundred  million  pieces  of  gold,  and  four  hundred 
million  silver  coins.  Then  the  assisting  priests  placed  all  the 
king's  gifts  before  the  holy  sages,  Vasishtha  and  Rishyasringa 
and  begged  them  to  distribute  them. 

Each  one  received  his  just  share  and  the  priests  were  highly 
pleased  and  well  satisfied.  The  king  gave  away  gold  coins 
to  those  who  had  come  to  witness  the  sacrifice  and  ten  million 
gold  coins  were  bestowed  on  other  brahmins  present  at  that  time. 
A  needy  mendicant  begged  for  the  diamond  studded  bracelet 
worn  by  the  king  himself  and  it  was  freely  bestowed  on  him. 

Beholding  the  brahmins  fully  satisfied,  King  Dasaratha  with 
great  gladness  made  obeisance  to  them  again  and  again. 

The  twice-born  then  bestowed  their  blessings  on  the  king 
who  was  exceedingly  liberal  and  valorous  and  who  saluted  them 
by  prostrating  himself  on  the  earth. 

Thus  ended  the  great  sacrifice,  the  means  of  destroying  sin 
and  attaining  heaven  and  scarcely  to  be  accomplished  by  other 
monarchs.

Then  the  king  addressed  Rishyasringa  and  said :  "  O  Thou 
of  great  and  virtuous  resolve,  tell  me  what  further  must  be  done 
by  me  to  be  blessed  with  an  heir  ?  " 

The  Sage  Rishyasringa  replied :  "  O  King,  thou  shalt  be 
blessed  with  four  sons,  who  will  perpetuate  the  royal  line." 


CHAPTER    15 

To  destroy  Ravana,  Shri  Vishnu  resolves  to  incarnate 

The  wise  Rishyasringa,  versed  in  the  Scriptures,  meditated  for 
a  while  and  then  spoke  to  King  Dasaratha  saying : — 

"  O  King,  I  will  perform  the  sacrifice  Puttatresti,1  spoken  of 
in  the  Atharva  Veda,  which  will  assist  thee  in  thy  endeavour 
to  obtain  a  son." 

Then  the  sage  inaugurated  the  sacrifice  and  poured  oblations 
into  the  sacred  fire  accompanied  by  the  chant  of  Vedic  mantras. 

The  celestial  beings,  gandharvas,  siddhas*  and  sages  assembled 
to  obtain  their  portion  of  the  sacrifice.  After  the  sacrifice, 
they  all  approached  Shri  Brahma,  the  Lord  of  mankind  and 
with  joined  palms  addressed  him : — 

They  said :  "  O  Blessed  Lord,  having  been  favoured  by  thee, 
the  Asura  Havana,  perpetually  troubles  us  who  are  helpless, 
since  thou  hast  granted  great  boons  to  him  and  we  are  forced 
to  bear  his  fearful  oppression, 

"  This  Lord  of  Rakshasas  has  persecuted  the  three  worlds 
and  having  overthrown  the  guardians  of  the  earth,  he  has  even 
humbled  Indra  himself.  Provoking  the  sages,  contemplativcs, 
brahmins  and  the  gods,  he  even  controls  the  sun's  rays  and 
the  wind's  power,  even  the  ocean  in  his  presence  is  still.  At 
his  approach,  O  Blessed  Lord,  we  are  terrified.  O  Giver  of 
Boons,  be  pleased  to  bring  about  his  destruction." 

Hearing  these  words,  Brahma  reflected  for  a  while  and

answered :  "  I  have  devised  a  plan  for  slaying  this  wicked  tyrant. 
It  was  granted  to  Ravana  that  no  gandharva,  yaksha  or  deva 
should  be  able  to  slay  him,  but  thinking  man  to  be  of  no  account, 
he  did  not  ask  to  be  made  invulnerable  in  regard  to  him; 
therefore,  none  but  man  can  destroy  him." 

These  words,  uttered  by  Shri  Brahma  rilled  the  celestial  and 
other  beings  with  joy. 

At  this  time  the  immortal  Vishnu,  with  conch,  disc  and  mace, 
the  Overlord  of  the  whole  world,  clad  in  a  yellow  robe,  appeared 
at  that  place.  Adored  by  the  gods,  he  drew  near  and  took 
bis  seat  by  Shri  Brahma,  then  all  the  gods  addressed  him 


"  O  Madhusudana1,  for  the  good  of  all  beings,  we  entreat 
Thee,  to  be  born  as  heir  to  the  supremely  righteous,  charitable 
and  illustrious  Sage  Dasaratha.  Appear,  O  Lord,  in  the  form 
of  four  sons  to  the  three  consorts  of  that  great  king.  Descending 
into  a  human  body,  do  thou  slay  Ravana,  the  scourge  of  the 
universe,  whom  we  are  unable  to  destroy.  That  ignorant 
Ravana,  by  his  power,  afflicts  the  devas,  siddhas  and  sages. 

0  Lord,  that  wicked  asura,  sporting  in  the  garden  of  Indra, 
has  slain  countless  nymphs  and  gandharvas.  In  company  with 
the  sages,  we  approach  Thee  so  that  we  may  be  released  from 
this  oppression.  We  take  refuge  in  Thee,  Thou  art  our  only 
asylum  ]  O  Lord,  we  beseech  Thee  to  take  birth  as  man  in 
order  to  destroy  the  enemy  of  men  and  gods." 

Thus  did  the  gods  appeal  to  Shri  Vishnu  and  He,  adored 
by  the  world,  answered  them  who  had  taken  refuge  in  Him : — 

"  O  Devas,  fear  no  more,  peace  be  with  you.    For  your  sake, 

1  will  destroy  Ravana,  together  with  his  sons,  grandsons, 
counsellors,  friends  and  relatives.  Having  slain  that  cruel  and 
wicked  asura,  the  cause  of  fear  to  iht  divine  sages,  I  will  rule 
in  the  world  of  mortals  for  eleven  thousand  years." 

Thus  did  Shri  Vishnu  grant  a  boon  to  the  gods,  and  then 
reflected  as  to  where  on  the  earth  he  should  take  birth  as  man. 

Then  the  lotus-eyed  Lord  resolved  to  become  incarnate  as 
the  four  sons  of  King  Dasaratha.

of  Indra  and  the  scourge  of  the  ascetics  and  pious  men,  one 
who  strikes  terror  into  every  heart,  causing  universal  lamentation. 
"  Destroy,  O  Lord,  this  mighty  being,  together  with  his  army,

He  decides  to  incarnate  as  the  four  sons  of  King  Dasaratka 

The  Omniscient  Lord,  Shri  Narayana,1  listened  to  the  praise 
offered  by  the  gods  and  honouring  them,  uttered  words  of 
pleasing  import  to  them. 

He  said :  "  O  Devas,  by  what  means  may  the  King  of  the 
Asuras  be  slain,  that  thorn  in  the  side  of  holy  men  ?  " 

The  gods  with  one  accord  answered  the  imperishable  Lord, 
crying :  "  Do  Thou  become  incarnate  in  the  form  of  man  and 
slay  him  in  open  fight.  O  Conqueror  of  Thy  foes,  Ravana 
has  long  practised  austerities,  by  means  of  which  he  has  won 
the  favour  of  the  world-revered  Brahma.  That  deity  has 
granted  him  a  boon,  by  which  he  is  rendered  invulnerable  to  all 
but  man.  Considering  man  of  no  account,  he  does  not  fear 
him.  The  boon  bestowed  on  him  by  Shri  Brahma  has  made 
him  arrogant  and  he  is  bringing  destruction  to  the  three  worlds 
and  carrying  off  women  by  violence.  Therefore,  O  Lord,  man 
alone  can  bring  about  his  death." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  gods,  Shri  Vishnu  resolved  to  choose 
King  Dasaratha  as  his  sire. 

At  that  time,  the  illustrious  King  Dasaratha,  the  slayer  of  his 
foes,  began  to  observe  the  sacrifice  in  order  to  obtain  an  heir. 
Shri  Vishnu,  having  formed  his  resolution  to  appear  in  human 
form  and  concluded  his  deliberations  with  Shri  Brahma, 
vanished.

Forthwith  there  issued  from  King  Dasaratha's  sacrificial  fire 
to  the  sound  resembling  the  beating  of  a  drum,  a  great  Being 
of  limitless  splendour,  of  glowing  countenance,  clad  in  red  and 
hairy  as  a  lion.  Bearing  auspicious  marks  and  adorned  with 
beautiful  ornaments,  his  height  was  equal  to  the  peak  of  a 
mountain.  Striding  boldly  like  a  lion,  his  form  shone  as  fire. 
In  both  hands  he  carried,  as  would  a  beloved  spouse,  a  vessel 
of  gold,  with  a  silver  cover,  filled  with  payasa.1 

This  great  Being  addressed  the  king  saying :  "  O  King,  I 
come  from  Prajapati.*  The  king  bowing  down  with  joined

hast  thou  for  me  ?  " 

Then  the  Being  replied :  "Receive  the  fruit  of  thy  sacrifice  ! 
O  Chief  of  Men,  accept  this  dish  of  payasa  prepared  by  the  gods, 
it  will  bring  thee  sons  and  increase  thy  power.  Let  it  be  eaten 
by  thy  consorts,  they  will  then  present  thee  with  the  heirs  for 
whose  sake  thou  hast  performed  the  sacrifice." 

The  king  received  the  food  contained  in  the  golden  vessel 
prepared  by  the  gods  and  reverently  raised  it  to  his  forehead. 
Having  received  the  divine  repast,  he  rejoiced  as  a  penniless  man 
on  obtaining  wealth. 

Forthwith  that  wonderful  and  resplendent  being  vanished, 
having  offered  the  consecrated  food  to  the  king. 

The  tidings  of  this  great  event  caused  the  consorts  of  King 
Dasaratha  extreme  delight  and  they  appeared  as  radiant  as  the 
beams  of  the  moon  irradiating  the  autumnal  sky. 

Entering  the  private  apartments,  the  king  addressed  Queen 
Kaushalya,  saying :  "  Receive  this  food  and  partake  of  it  that 
thou  mayest  have  a  son/' 

Thereafter,  the  monarch  gave  half  of  the  dish  to  Queen 
Kaushalya  and  one-third  to  Queen  Sumitra.  Then  he  gave 
the  eighth  of  the  payasa  to  Queen  Kaikeyi  and,  after  reflection, 
the  remainder  to  Queen  Sumitra.  In  this  way,  the  King  divided 
the  dish  of  payasa  among  his  three  queens. 

On  partaking  of  the  food,  the  beautiful  queens  were  overjoyed 
and  considered  themselves  most  fortunate.

the  queens  soon  became  pregnant,  their  wombs  glowing  like 
the  fire  in  the  sun. 

The  illustrious  sqvereign  perceiving  that  the  wombs  of  his 
consorts  were  quickened  and  that  his  great  desire  was  about 
to  be  fulfilled,  was  filled  with  supreme  joy,  as  is  Shri  Vishnu 
when  worshipped  by  the  gods  and  perfect  beings  in  the  celestial 
region. 


CHAPTER    17 

To  assist  Shri  Vishnu,  celestial  beings  incarnate  as  warriors 
of  the  monkey  tribe 

Shri  Vishnu  having  become  the  sons1  of  King  Dasaratha,  the 
divine  Brahma  thus  addressed  the  gods :  "  The  blessed  Lord 
Vishnu,  the  Ocean  of  Truth  is  engaged  in  a  just  undertaking 
for  the  good  of  all,  you  should  therefore  support  Him  by 
becoming  incarnate  as  great  beings  in  the  monkey  tribe,  skilled 
in  the  arts  of  magic,  swift  as  the  wind,  conversant  with  the 
dictates  of  virtue,  wise  and  equal  in  might  to  the  Lord,  invincible, 
endowed  with  celestial  bodies  and  skilful  in  the  science  of  war- 
fare. Some  among  you  should  assume  the  forms  of  nymphs, 
gandharvas  and  female  ascetics  who  will  give  birth  to  heroes 
in  the  monkey  tribe. 

"  In  the  past,  when  I  yawned,  the  great  bear,  by  the  name 
of  Jambavan,  issued  from  my  mouth." 

The  gods  thus  instructed  by  the  blessed  Lord,  caused  warriors 
to  be  born  in  the  monkey  tribe  from  the  wombs  of  countless 
celestial  beings. 

Indra  created  Bali,  the  Sun  created  Sugriva;  Brihaspati 
created  the  wise  Tara,  Kuvera  begat  Gandha-madana,1  Vishwa-

as  resplendent  as  fire  and  in  valour  surpassed  his  rather.

The  Aswini-Kumaras1  produced  Minda  and  Dvivida ; 
Varuna2  begat  Sucbena ;  Megha,8  was  the  father  of  Sharabha, 
the  mighty ;  Favana4  begat  the  warrior  called  Hanuman,  whose 
body  was  as  hard  as  a  diamond  and  whose  speed  equalled  an 
eagle's ;  he  excelled  all  the  other  warriors  in  wisdom  and 
power. 

There  were  thousands  of  warriors  born  in  the  monkey  tribe 
ready  to  destroy  Ravana.  All  the  bears,  monkeys  and  chimpan- 
zees resembled  the  god  that  had  produced  them  in  characteristics, 
habits  and  prowess,  and  many  were  of  outstanding  valour.  The 
female  chimpanzees  and  bears  gave  birth  to  great  beings  of 
divine  nature.  They  produced  hundreds  and  thousands  of 
healthy  progeny.  These  dwellers  of  the  forest  were  imposing 
in  form  and  in  strength  and  fearlessness  resembled  lions  and 
tigers.  All  were  able  to  cleave  rocks  and  mountains  and  fight 
with  their  nails  and  teeth.  Skilled  in  every  kind  of  weapon, 
they  could  shake  great  peaks,  uproot  the  stoutest  trees  and  by 
their  velocity  even  put  the  sea  god  to  shame.  Able  to  tear  up 
the  earth  with  their  feet  and  cause  the  ocean  to  overflow,  they 
could  fly  in  the  air  and  even  seize  the  clouds. 

These  beings  of  the  monkey  tribe  wandered  in  the  woods, 
making  captive  the  elephants,  and  by  their  shouts  causing  the 
birds  in  flight  to  fall  to  the  ground.  Thus  were  born  millions 
of  monkeys,  able  to  assume  any  form,  together  with  hundreds 
and  thousands  of  monkey  chiefs. 

These  chiefs  begot  other  brave  and  powerful  beings,  some 
of  whom  dwelt  on  the  mountains  while  others  inhabited  the 
valleys  and  forests. 

The  two  brothers,  Sugriva,  the  offspring  of  Surya,1  and  Bali, 
the  son  of  India,  became  the  leaders  of  all  the  monkeys.  Others 
lived  under  the  command  of  group  leaders,  such  as  Nala,  Nila 
and  Hanuman.  They  were  as  strong  as  eagles  and  skilled  in 
every  sort  of  warfare. 

Wandering  about  the  forest,  they  slew  lions,  tigers  and

King  Dasaratha's  sorts  are  born  and  grow  to  manhood 

When  the  sacrifice  of  King  Dasaratha  had  been  brought  to 
a  successful  conclusion,  the  gods,  receiving  their  due  portions, 
returned  to  their  abode. 

The  king  also,  having  fulfilled  the  obligations  incurred  by 
his  initiation,  returned  to  the  capital  with  his  queens,  servants, 
army  and  vehicles. 

The  royal  guests  to  whom  due  hospitality  had  been  shown, 
made  obeisance  to  the  Sage  Vasishtha  and  returned  to  their 
homes.  When  they  departed,  ornaments,  apparel  and  gifts  were 
distributed  to  their  armies  who  set  out  for  their  own  cities 
with  joy. 

King  Dasaratha  attended  the  departure  of  his  guests  and  then 
re-entered  the  capital  in  a  procession  preceded  by  the  holy 
brahmins. 

Rishyasringa  with  bis  wife  Shanta  then  took  leave  of  the 
monarch  and  departed  to  his  own  city,  King  Dasaratha  accom- 
panying him  for  some  distance.  Then  the  king,  expecting  to 
be  blessed  with  an  heir,  dwelt  happily  in  Ayodhya. 

Six  seasons  after  the  completion  of  the  sacrifice,  in  the  twelfth 
month,  on  the  ninth  day  of  the  moon  of  Chaitramas,  the  star 
Punarvasu  was  in  the  ascendant,  and  the  planets,  the  Sun,  Mars, 
Saturn,  Jupiter  and  Venus  were  exalted,  and  those  signs  of 
the  zodiac,  such  as  the  Ram,  the  Fishes,  and  the  Scales  in 
auspicious  aspects,  the  moon  and  Jupiter  being  in  conjunction 
at  the  period  called  Karka.  Then  the  world-honoured  Lord 
of  the  World,  endowed  with  divine  attributes,  Shri  Ramachandra 
was  born  of  the  womb  of  Kaushalya.

BALA    KANDA 

The  Promoter  of  the  glory  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku,  the 
blessed  Lord  Vishnu  was  born  as  a  son  of  Queen  Raushalya. 
When  this  child  of  limitless  splendour  was  bom,  the  queen 
looked  most  beautiful,  like  Aditi  of  old,  favoured  by  Indra. 

The  hero  of  the  realm  of  truth,  Bharata,  was  born  of  Queen 
Kaikeyi.  Possessed  of  every  grace,  he  was  endowed  with  a 
quarter  of  the  glory  of  Shri  Vishnu. 

Sumitra  gave  birth  to  Lakshmana  and  Shatrughna,  heroes 
skilful  in  the  wielding  of  weapons  and  also  partaking  of  Shri 
Vishnu's  glory. 

Bharata  was  born  when  the  star  Pushya  was  in  the  ascendant 
in  the  Lagna  Meena.1  During  the  ascendance  of  the  star 
Shlasa  in  the  Lagna  Karka,*  at  the  time  of  sunrise  Shatrughna 
was  born. 

Each  of  the  sons  of  the  king  had  special  attributes  and  were 
endowed  with  great  qualities,  they  were  as  resplendent  as  the 
Purva,3  Uttara*  and  Bhadripata*  stars. 

At  that  time  gandharvas  played  divine  melodies,  nymphs 
danced,  celestial  drums  were  heard  and  the  gods  showered 
flowers  from  the  sky. 

Everywhere  in  the  capital,  signs  of  rejoicing  were  apparent ; 
the  streets  were  rilled  with  actors  and  dancers  and  those  who 
sang  or  played  on  various  instruments. 

The  king  gave  gifts  to  the  bards  and  ballad  singers  and 
conferred  wealth  and  cows  on  the  brahmins. 

The  four  children  were  named  on  the  twelfth  day ;  the  eldest 
son  received  the  name  Ramachandra,  and  the  name  given  to 
the  son  of  Queen  Kaikeyi  was  Bharata. 

The  sons  of  Queen  Sumitra  were  called  Lakshmana  and 
Shatrughna.  The  ceremony  was  performed  by  the  holy  Sage 
Vasishtha  with  great  joy.  After  this,  the  brahmins  of  the  capital 
and  the  country  were  feasted  and  presented  with  gifts  and 
precious  gems. 

Resembling  the  deity  Shri  Brahma,  the  king  showed  universal

benevolence.  The  princes  grew  in  the  knowledge  of  the  Veda, 
in  courage  and  active  goodwill  to  all.  Though  each  was  wise, 
learned  and  possessed  of  every  virtue,  yet  Shri  Ramachandra 
excelled  them  in  truthfulness  and  energy,  and  was  beloved  of  all, 
like  the  flawless  orb  of  the  moon.  Expert  in  mounting  the 
elephant,  the  horse  and  the  chariot,  he  was  skilful  in  archery 
and  devoted  to  the  service  of  his  parents. 

Shri  Lakshmana  cherished  an  exceeding  love  for  his  elder 
brother  Shri  Ramachandra,  the  delight  of  the  world,  and  Shri 
Rama  loved  him  also  as  his  very  self.  Shri  Ramachandra  loved 
Lakshmana  who  was  endowed  with  every  excellent  quality,  as 
his  own  life,  and  neither  slept  nor  partook  of  any  nourishment 
without  the  other. 

When  Raghava  mounted  on  horseback,  engaged  in  the  chase, 
Shri  Lakshmana  followed  with  bow  and  arrows  to  protect 
him. 

Emulating  the  example  of  Shri  Ramachandra,  Bharata  loved 
Shatrughna  and  was  loved  by  him  with  equal  affection. 

The  monarch  was  as  pleased  and  satisfied  with  his  four  sons 
as  is  Shri  Brahma  with  the  four  Vedas.  Observing  the  wisdom, 
prudence  and  modesty  of  his  children,  who  were  endowed  with 
every  great  attribute,  King  Dasaratha  derived  as  great  a  delight 
from  them  as  Brahma  from  the  four  guardians  of  the  earth. 

The  princes  studied  the  Veda  with  perseverance,  affectionately 
attended  on  the  king  and  acquired  proficiency  in  the  use  of  arms. 

One  day  when  the  illustrious  sovereign  was  in  council  with 
his  relatives,  ministers,  and  learned  preceptors,  deliberating  on 
the  marriage  of  his  four  sons,  the  great  Sage  Vishwamitra 
appeared  in  the  capital.  Seeking  an  audience  with  the  king, 
he  addressed  the  doorkeeper,  saying :  "  Inform  the  king  speedily 
that  the  son  of  Gadhi  of  the  race  of  Kaushika  is  at  the  gate." 
The  awe-stricken  guard  hastened  to  the  royal  apartment  and 
conveyed  the  tidings  with  due  respect  to  his  majesty,  who  with 
his  Guru  Vasishtha  went  forth  to  welcome  the  sage  at  the  gate 
and  bring  him  into  the  royal  palace. 

As  Brahma  welcomes  Indra,  so  did  they  greet  the  muni,  and 
beholding  that  resplendent  and  mighty  ascetic,  the  observer  of 
great  vows,  of  cheerful  countenance,  the  king  offered  him  arghya 
according  to  the  prescribed  tradition. 


BALA    KANDA 

The  virtuous  Vishwamitra  then  enquired  of  the  king  concern- 
ing the  welfare  of  the  empire,  the  prosperity  of  his  people, 
relatives  and  friends  and  also  as  to  the  state  of  the  royal  treasury. 
Thereafter,  the  sage  questioned  the  monarch  further,  saying : 
"Are  thy  vassals  obedient  to  thee  ?  Are  thine  enemies  subdued  ? 
Are  the  Vedic  sacrifices  duly  observed  in  thy  dominion  ?  Are 
strangers  entertained  with  fitting  hospitality?"  Then  after 
enquiring  as  to  the  well-being  of  Shri  Vasishtha  and  other  sages, 
Shri  Vishwamitra  entered  the  palace. 

Here  the  king  once  more  paid  him  reverence  and  with  delight 
addressed  him  saying :  "  O  August  Sage,  thy  coming  has  caused 
me  as  great  a  joy  as  the  acquisition  of  ambrosia  or  the  advent 
of  rain  falling  on  the  parched  earth.  O  Sage,  thy  approach 
is  as  grateful  to  me  as  the  birth  of  a  son  to  one  without  an  heir 
or  the  recovery  of  his  wealth  to  one  who  imagined  it  to  be 
irretrievably  lost.  O  Mighty  Sage,  I  welcome  thee  with  my 
whole  heart,  say  what  commands  thou  hast  for  me  ?  When 
thy  glance  doth  fall  upon  me,  O  Sage,  I  become  righteous  and 
acquire  merit;  to-day  my  life  is  rendered  fruitful  and  the 
purpose  of  my  birth  is  accomplished  since  thou  hast  visited 
me.  O  Auspicious  One,  formerly  thou  wast  a  warrior  sage, 
illustrious  by  virtue  of  thy  sacred  practices,  but  now  thou  art 
become  a  brahmin1  and  art  worthy  of  supreme  worship  by  me. 
Thine  advent  has  conferred  purity  and  blessing  on  me,  and  by  thy 
sacred  presence  both  the  kingdom  and  I  have  been  purged  of 
every  offence.  Be  pleased  to  tell  us  of  the  purpose  of  thy  coming, 
I  desire  to  manifest  my  gratitude  to  thee  by  rendering 
thee  service.  O  Kaushika,  do  not  hesitate  to  speak  thy  will, 
I  am  ready  to  do  anything  for  thee ;  thou  art  to  me  as  a  god. 
O  Brahman  Seer,  by  beholding  thee,  I  have  acquired  the  great 
merits  of  a  pilgrimage." 

Hearing  the  words  of  King  Dasaratha,  sweet  sounding  and 
in  accordance  with  the  scriptural  injunctions,  the  great  sage, 
the  repository  of  all  excellent  qualities,  was  highly  gratified. 


1  Vishwamitra  was  originally  of  the  warrior  class  and  won  brahminhood 
by  his  asceticism.     His  story  follows  later.

CHAPTER    19 

Vi$hwamitra*s  request 

Hearing  the  laudatory  and  admirable  words  of  that  Lion  among 
kings,  Dasaratha,  the  great  Sage  Vishwamitra  answered :  "  O 
Great  King,  who  in  the  world  save  one  of  the  House  of 
Ikshwaku,  instructed  by  Shri  Vasishtha,  could  give  tongue  to 
such  utterances  ?  O  Illustrious  Monarch,  I  will  now  unfold  my 
purpose,  do  thou  fulfil  it  and  prove  the  truth  of  thy  words. 

**  O  Chief  of  Men,  when  I  undertake  the  observance  of  sacred 
sacrifices  to  enhance  my  perfection,  two  rakshasas,  adepts  in 
magic,  create  great  impediments.  When,  after  long  effort,  the 
sacrifice  approaches  consummation,  then  these  two  rakshasas, 
Maricha  and  Suvahu  destroy  the  rite  and  defile  the  altar  with 
blood  and  flesh.  My  holy  endeavours  being  thus  frustrated, 
I  become  despondent  and  leave  the  place  of  sacrifice.  O  King, 
it  is  not  permitted  to  me  to  show  wrath  when  engaged  in  sacrifice, 
and  I  therefore  refrain  from  cursing  them.  Do  thou  lend  me 
the  services  of  thy  son,  Shri  Ramachandra,  the  truthful,  the 
brave,  that  hero,  whose  locks  fall  on  his  cheeks. 

"  Under  my  protection,  he  will  destroy  those  mischievous 
rakshasas  and  I  will  confer  great  blessings  on  him.  I  will 
instruct  him  for  his  good  in  many  sciences  and  he  will  become 
famous  in  the  three  worlds.  The  rakshasas  will  not  be  able 
to  stand  against  Rama  and  no  one  else  can  destroy  them.  They 
are  proud  and  powerful,  but  now,  owing  to  their  sins,  their 
destruction  is  imminent,  they  will  not  be  able  to  withstand  Shri 
Ramachandra, 

"  Do  not  allow  a  father's  affection  to  overcome  thee  ;  I  assure 
thee  that  in  the  presence  of  Shri  Ramachandra,  the  rakshasas 
are  as  good  as  slain.  Rama's  virtues  are  known  to  Shri  Vasishtha 
and  other  ascetics.  O  King,  if  thou  seekest  everlasting  renown 
and  merit  in  this  world,  then  let  Shri  Rama  go  with  me.  Seek 
the  advice  of  Shri  Vasishtha  and  thy  counsellors  and  if  they 
approve  the  project,  give  me  Ramachandra.  Be  pleased,  O 
King,  to  give  up  thy  beloved  son  for  the  space  of  ten  days, 
so  that  I  may  complete  the  sacrifice.  O  King,  help  me  in

BALA    KANDA 

furthering  my  sacrifice,  and  do  not  let  the  allotted  time  pass 
in  vain.    Do  what  is  auspicious,  do  not  grieve." 

The  upright  and  resplendent  Sage  Vishwamitra  having  uttered 
these  righteous  words,  became  silent. 

The  words  of  Shri  Vishwamitra  filled  the  king  with  anxiety 
and  he  became  distraught.  Because  of  these  inexorable  words, 
the  monarch  trembled  and  fell  unconscious  from  his  seat 
overcome  with  grief. 


CHAPTER    20 

The  king's  reluctance  to  allow  Shri  Rama  to  contend  with 
Markka  and  Suvahu 

For  some  rime  the  king  lay  insensible,  then  regaining  conscious- 
ness he  said :  "  My  lotus-eyed  Rama  is  but  fifteen  years  old, 
I  cannot  believe  he  is  capable  of  contending  with  the  rakshasas. 
I  possess  a  large  and  well-equipped  army  and  will  myself  lead  it 
against  the  demons.  My  seasoned  warriors,  who  are  courageous 
and  skilled  in  bearing  weapons  and  who  are  suitably  remunerated 
by  me,  are  fit  to  fight  the  rakshasas  in  battle ;  therefore,  do  not 
ask  for  Rama.  I  myself,  bearing  my  bow  and  arrows,  will  lead 
the  army  in  the  field  and  fight  to  my  last  breath.  With  this 
protection,  thy  sacrifice  will  come  to  a  successful  conclusion. 
I  will  go  thither  in  person,  do  not  take  away  Shri  Ramachandra. 
Shri  Rama  is  still  a  child  without  military  experience,  he  cannot 
estimate  the  strength  or  weakness  of  the  enemy,  he  has  not  yet 
acquired  proficiency  in  warfare. 

"  Thou  knowest  well,  O  Sage,  how  crafty  are  the  rakshasas 
in  combat.  Shri  Ramachandra  is  not  capable  of  opposing  them 
successfully.  I  cannot  bear  the  thought  of  Ramachandra 
contending  with  them.  O  Sage,  I  shall  not  live,  even  for  a 
moment,  if  Shri  Rama  be  separated  from  me,  therefore,  I  entreat 
thee,  do  not  ask  for  him.  Should'st  thou  insist  on  Rama 
accompanying  thee,  then  take  my  forces  also  with  thee.  O 
August  Vishwamitra,  recollect  I  pray  thee  that  I  am  now  nine

thousand  years  old  and  have  begotten  these  sons  with  great 
difficulty.  These  princes  are  dearer  to  me  than  life  itself  and 
Shri  Ramachandra  is  the  dearest  of  them  all.  Excelling  in  virtue, 
he  is  my  eldest  son,  therefore,  do  not  take  him  from  me.  O 
Great  Sage,  how  powerful  are  these  rakshasas  ?  Who  are  their 
supporters  and  how  dost  thou  imagine  Shri  Rama  can  destroy 
them  ?  O  Blessed  Lord,  say  if  thou  deemestthat  I  and  my  army 
may  successfully  oppose  those  rakshasas  who  are  skilled  in  magic  ?" 

Shri  Vishwamitra  answered :  "  O  King,  Ravana,  born  of  the 
great  family  of  Poulastya,  having  been  favoured  by  Brahma 
with  a  boon,  is  oppressing  the  three  worlds.  He  is  exceedingly 
powerful  and  supported  by  many  asuric  followers.  It  is  said 
that  this  great  warrior  Ravana  is  the  King  of  Asuras.  He  is 
the  brother  of  Kuvera  and  the  son  of  the  Sage  Vishravas.  He 
does  not  obstruct  the  lesser  sacrifices  in  person,  but  two  mighty 
rakshasas  named  Maricha  and  Suvahu,  prompted  by  him,  dis- 
rupt the  sacrificial  rites." 

The  king  listened  to  the  muni's  words  and  then  spoke  :  "  I 
am  not  able  to  oppose  that  evil-souled  asura.  O  Knower  of 
the  Law  of  Righteousness,  I  am  but  a  wretched  man  and  thou 
art  worthy  of  my  worship ;  thou  art  verily  a  god  and  also 
my  spiritual  preceptor.  Since  the  gods,  the  danavas,  gand- 
harvas,  yakshas,  birds  and  snakes  cannot  destroy  Ravana,  how 
can  man  do  so  ?  In  battle,  Ravana  is  able  to  defeat  the  mightiest 
warriors,  it  is  certain  therefore,  that  neither  I  nor  my  army 
can#ontend  with  him.  How  can  I  then  send  my  son,  beautiful 
as  a  god,  but  inexperienced  in  war,  to  oppose  Ravana  ?  O  Sage, 
I  will  not  let  my  young  child  go.  Lavana,  the  son  of  Madhu 
is  among  those  who  destroy  the  sacrifice.  I  will  not  give  up 
my  son.  The  sons  of  Sunda  and  Upasunda,  Maricha  and 
Suvahu,  who  resemble  death  itself  in  battle,  are  among  those 
who  impede  the  sacrifice.  They  are  skilful  and  seasoned 
warriors,  I  dare  not  send  my  young  son  against  them.  Whoever 
thou  chooseth,  friends,  relatives  or  even  I  myself  will  accompany 
thee  to  engage  in  the  fight." 

On  hearing  the  king's  injudicious  words,  the  holy  sage  was 
enraged.    As  an  oblation  poured  into  the  fire  adds  to  the 
fierceness  of  the  flame,  so  did  the  words  of  King  Dasaratha 
add  to  the  fire  of  anger  kindled  in  the  sage's  heart.

CHAPTER    21 

On  Vasishtha's  advice  the  king  acquiesces 

Hearing  the  words  of  King  Dasaratha  inspired  by  solicitude 
for  his  son,  the  great  sage  replied  in  displeasure : — 

"  O  King,  recollect  that  thou  art  born  in  the  house  of  Raghu, 
how  can'st  thou  presume  to  break  thy  promise  ?  This  action 
is  unworthy  of  thy  royal  line  and  is  also  improper.  If  this  be 
thy  determined  desire,  I  will  take  my  leave,  do  thou  live  at  ease 
amidst  thy  relatives  and  friends,  O  Violater  of  thy  Word !  " 

At  the  wrath  of  the  august  sage,  the  whole  earth  shook  and 
the  gods  began  to  tremble.  Seeing  the  whole  world  shaken 
with  terror,  the  wise  and  patient  muni  Shri  Vasishtha  intervened, 
and  thus  addressed  the  king : — 

"  O  King,  thou  art  born  in  the  family  of  Ikshwaku  and  art 
righteousness  personified !  Blessed  by  fortune,  filled  with 
patience  and  endurance,  thou  hast  cherished  great  vows  and 
should'st  not,  therefore,  abandon  dharma.1  The  three  worlds 
know  thee  as  virtuous,  it  is  thy  duty  to  maintain  integrity  and 
not  to  act  in  contradiction  to  it.  O  Chief  of  Men,  if  one  making 
a  promise  does  not  honour  it,  he  loses  the  merit  of  his  good 
deeds.  It  is,  therefore,  for  thee  to  be  faithful  to  thy  word 
and  let  Rama  accompany  this  sage.  Though  Shri  Ramachandra 
is  inexperienced  in  warfare,  yet  the  asuras  will  not  be  able  to 
overcome  him.  Furthermore,  he  is  under  the  protection  of 
Shri  Vishwamitra  and  no  harm  can  come  to  him.  How  can  one 
steal  the  nectar  that  is  surrounded  by  fire  ?  The  holy  Vish- 
wamitra is  virtue  itself,  his  powers  are  unsurpassed,  and  there 
is  none  living  equal  to  him  in  wisdom  and  asceticism.  In  the 
whole  world  of  men  and  other  beings,  none  excels  him  in  the 
use  of  weapons  and  none  has  fathomed  the  depth  of  his  nature. 
Neither  the  celestials,  nor  the  sages,  nor  the  asuras,  nor  any 
other  beings  know  the  full  glory  of  this  sage.  The  god 
Krishasawa  and  his  highly  virtuous  sons  gave  every  variety 
of  weapon  to  Vishwamitra  when  he  was  king.  The  two  daughters

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  Daksha,  Jaya  and  Suprabha  invented  thousands  of  resplendent 
weapons.  Shri  Vishwamitra  is  not  one,  but  many  in  one  form ; 
he  is  illustrious,  mighty  and  able  to  defeat  any  in  battle.  Jaya 
produced  five  hundred  weapons  supremely  potent  and  capable 
of  destroying  a  host  of  asuras.  Suprabha  also  created  five 
hundred  weapons  of  war  which  no  foe  in  the  world  could 
withstand.  Shri  Vishwamitra  is  an  adept  in  the  use  of  all  these 
arms,  O  King,  he  is  also  able  to  create  many  new  weapons 
and  there  is  nothing  in  the  three  divisions  of  time1  which  is 
not  known  to  him.  Do  not  hesitate  to  send  thy  son  Rama 
with  this  mighty  and  courageous  sage,  Shri  Vishwamitra,  and 
do  not  entertain  any  fears  for  his  safety.  The  Sage  Vishwamitra 
is  well  able  to  destroy  the  demons,  but  asks  for  the  services 
of  thy  son  for  his  own  good." 

The  Guru  Vasishtha  having  thus  exhorted  the  monarch,  the 
king  cheerfully  acquiesced  to  Shri  Ratnachandra  accompanying 
the  sage.

Instructed  by  Shri  Vasishtha,  King  Dasaratha  with  a  cheerful

At  the  time  of  their  departure,  the  Peace  Chant  was  recited 
by  the  king,  whilst  the  Guru  Vasishtha  pronounced  the  benedic- 
tion. The  illustrious  sovereign  then  smelt  the  heads8  of  his 
sons  with  joy  and  delivered  them  into  the  care  of  the  sage. 

When  the  lotus-eyed  Ramachandra  and  Prince  Lakshmana 
had  taken  their  leave,  Vayu3  sent  forth  cool  and  gentle  breezes 
redolent  with  fragrance  and  the  celestial  beings  showered  down

of  conches.

Shri  Vishwamitra  led  the  way  followed  by  the  most  illustrious 
Ramachandra,  then  came  Shri  Lakshmana  of  flowing  locks, 
bearing  a  bow  in  his  hand. 

The  two  handsome  and  powerful  princes  with  quivers  on 
their  backs  and  bows  in  their  hands,  adding  lustre  to  the  ten 
cardinal  points,  followed  the  muni  as  if  two  three-headed  snakes1 
were  following  Shri  Vishwamitra  or  as  the  Aswinikumaras  and 
Kinneras  follow  Brahma. 

Shri  Ramachandra  and  Lakshmana,  armed  with  their  bows, 
adorned  with  precious  jewels  and  wearing  gloves  made  of 
deerskin,  resplendent  and  beautiful,  girt  with  swords,  following 
the  holy  sage,  looked  like  the  two  sons  of  Shiva. 

Coming  to  the  river  Sarayu,  nine  miles  to  the  south  of  the 
capital,  the  Sage  Vishwamitra  addressed  Shri  Rama  in  gentle 
accents,  saying :  "  O  Child,  purify  thy  body  with  water.  When 
thou  hast  done  so,  I  will  teach  thee  the  use  of  Bala  and  Atibala. 
The  application  of  these  two  herbs  will  prevent  thee  from  being 
fatigued  or  suffering  from  disease,  nor  will  age  affect  thee. 
Even  should'st  thou  retire  to  rest  without  performing  the 
purification  ceremony  no  demon  will  be  able  to  afflict  thee ; 
none  in  the  world  will  equal  thee  in  prowess.  O  Rama,  no  one 
in  the  three  worlds  will  rival  thee  in  good  fortune,  skill, 
knowledge  and  practical  wisdom.  O  Prince,  when  thou  hast 
learnt  these  sciences,  thou  wilt  be  able  to  answer  any  question 
and  thou  wilt  be  unique  in  scholarship.  These  two  sciences, 
O  Rama,  are  the  parents  of  all  other  sciences.  Thou  wilt  be 
able  to  control  hunger  and  thirst  by  their  application.  O  Prince 
of  the  House  of  Raghu,  by  the  mastery  of  this  lore,  Bala  and 
Atibala,  thou  wilt  attain  renown  throughout  the  whole  world. 
These  brilliant  sciences  are  the  daughters  of  Brahma,  I  shall 
impart  them  to  thee,  O  Prince,  because  thou  art  qualified  to 
receive  them.  O  Rama,  all  the  fruits  of  this  knowledge  are 
already  thy  attributes,  yet  when  thou  hast  mastered  it,  thou 
wilt  be  able  to  teach  it  to  others." 

Shri  Ramachandra  then  poured  the  water  over  his  body  and 
with  a  cheerful  countenance  said  to  the  Sage  Vishwamitra  : — 
"  O  Great  Rishi,  I  am  thy  servant,  teach  me  these  sciences."

THE    RAMAYAMA    OF    VALMIKI 

Possessed  of  the  knowledge  of  these  two  sciences,  the  mighty 
Rama  resembled  the  sun  in  autumn,  emitting  a  thousand  rays. 
Then  the  two  brothers  massaged  the  feet  of  the  holy  Guru 
and  passed  the  night  pleasantly  on  the  banks  of  the  river  Sarayu. 
Shri  Rama  being  unaccustomed  to  sleeping  on  the  ground, 
the  two  sons  of  King  Dasaratha  made  a  bed  of  grass,  then 
having  listened  to  the  gentle  words  of  Shri  Vishwamitra,  they 
passed  the  night  in  sleep. 


chapter   23 

They  reach  the  hermitage  of  Kama 

A  little  before  dawn,  the  great  Muni  Vishwaroitra,  reclining 
on  his  grassy  couch,  addressed  the  princes,  saying :  "  O  Son 
of  Queen  Kaushalya,  O  Rama,  the  dawn  is  about  to  break, 
arise  and  perform  thy  morning  devotions." 

The  two  princes,  hearing  the  words  of  the  most  generous  sage, 
rose,  performed  their  ablutions,  offered  ceremonial  water  to  the 
rising  sun,  worshipped  their  ancestors  and  began  to  repeat 
the  holy  Gayatri.1  Their  devotions  completed,  they  offered 
salutations  with  great  reverence  to  the  distinguished  ascetic  and 
stood  ready  to  proceed  further. 

In  their  company,  the  holy  sage  reached  the  confluence  of 
the  rivers  where  the  Ganges  unites  herself  with  the  Sarayu. 
There  they  beheld  the  holy  ascetics  in  their  sacred  hermitage, 
where  for  a  long  time  they  had  practised  Yoga  assiduously. 

Seeing  the  peaceful  hermitage,  Shri  Ramachandra  and 
Lakshmana  were  filled  with  delight  and  said  to  the  Sage 
Vishwamitra  :  "  O  Blessed  Lord,  whose  holy  hermitage  is  this  ? 
Who  dwells  here  ?    We  are  both  eager  to  hear  of  this." 

The  great  sage  smiled  and  answered  Rama,  saying :  "  Hear, 
my  son,  I  will  tell  thee  who  formerly  dwelt  here.    Kandarpa,1

whom  the  pundits  called  Kama  once  took  human  form  and 
fixed  in  meditation,  worshipped  the  Lord  Shiva  here.  When 
Shri  Shiva  was  passing  with  his  newly-wedded  bride,  accom- 
panied by  celestial  beings,  Kama  tried  to  agitate  the  mind  of 
the  Lord  Shiva  and  reaped  the  due  punishment  of  his  insolence. 
O  Son  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  Shiva  in  wrath  opened  his  third 
eye  and  the  members  of  Kama's  body  were  consumed.  Since 
Kama  was  reduced  to  ashes  by  the  God,  he  has  been  a  dis- 
embodied being.  O  Rama,  since  that  time,  he  has  been  known 
as  Ananga  (bodiless)  and  the  country  where  his  limbs  were 
strewn  as  he  sought  to  flee,  is  known  as  Anga.  This  hermit- 
age belongs  to  the  Lord  Shiva  and  the  holy  men  who  dwell 
here  are  his  traditional  devotees :  they  are  both  righteous  and 
sinless.  O  Rama,  Thou  of  pleasing  looks,  this  night  I  shall 
break  my  journey  at  this  hermitage  and  to-morrow  we  shall 
cross  the  sacred  river  and  proceed  further.  O  Rama,  let  us 
first  purify  ourselves  by  bathing  and  then  recite  the  holy  Gayatri 
silently,  offering  oblations  into  the  sacred  tire,  we  will  thereafter 
pass  the  night  in  the  hermitage." 

While  Shri  Rama  and  the  sage  were  conversing,  the  holy 
ascetics  dwelling  in  the  hermitage,  knew  by  the  power  of  their 
Yoga,  that  these  great  beings  were  approaching  and  were  highly 
gratified. 

Having  presented  arghya  to  Shri  Vishwamitra,  they  then 
offered  hospitality  to  Shri  Ramachandra  and  Lakshmana. 
Entertained  by  those  dwelling  in  the  hermitage  who  regaled 
them  with  the  holy  traditions  and  philosophical  discourses, 
they  remained  there  for  their  evening  devotion  and  with  great 
delight  abode  in  the  hermitage  of  Kama,  the  devout  sages 
gathering  round  Shri  Vishwamitra  who  engaged  them  in 
pleasing  converse.

CHAPTER    24 

The  two  primes  with  Vishwamitra  behold  the  dark  forest 
of  Taraka 

When  the  day  dawned,  the  two  princes  performed  their  daily 
devotions  and  followed  Shri  Vishwamitra  to  the  river. 

The  keepers  of  sacred  vows,  the  dwellers  in  the  holy  hermitage 
accompanied  them  to  the  river  bank  and  arranged  for  an 
excellent  boat  to  take  them  across ;  they  said  to  Shri 
Vishwamitra : — 

"  O  Great  Rishi,  do  not  delay,  please  board  the  vessel  with 
the  royal  princes,  now,  and  thus  avoid  the  heat  of  the  day." 

Shri  Vishwamitra  paid  reverence  to  the  devout  sages  and 
proceeded  to  cross  the  sacred  river.  When  the  craft  was  in 
mid-stream,  the  roar  of  the  waters  was  heard  by  Shri  Rama- 
chandra  and  his  younger  brother.  They  questioned  the  holy 
sage,  saying :  "  O  Venerable  Lord,  what  is  the  cause  of  this 
tumult  ?  " 

In  answer  to  Shri  Ramachandra,  Shri  Vishwamitra  described 
the  cause  of  the  sound  in  the  following  manner : — 

"  O  Prince,  on  Mount  Kailasha,1  Shri  Brahma  created  a  lake 
by  the  power  of  his  thought,  on  account  of  which  it  is  called 
the  lake  of  the  Mind  (Manasarovara).  The  holy  river  Sarayu 
rises  in  the  Manasa  Lake  and  flows  through  the  capital  Ayodhya, 
here  it  joins  the  sacred  stream  Gunga,  and  this  sound  is  pro- 
duced when  the  two  rivers  unite.  With  concentrated  mind, 
offer  salutations  to  them." 

The  two  royal  princes  made  obeisance  to  the  rivers,  and 
having  reached  the  southern  bank,  left  the  boat  and  proceeded 
onward.  Walking  further,  the  two  princes  beheld  a  dark  and 
terrible  forest  and  Shri  Ramachandra  again  addressed  the  Sage 
as  follows :  "  O  Great  Sage,  this  forest  looks  dark  and  sinister ; 
above  the  ceaseless  clamour  of  crickets  and  other  insects,  fearful 
beasts  can  be  heard  roaring.  The  forest  resounds  with  their 
dread  cries  while  the  harsh  and  discordant  notes  of  birds  echo

through  it.  See,  O  Sage !  Boars,  lions,  tigers  and  elephants 
abound  there,  it  is  overgrown  with  dhara,  ashwakarna,  kujaja, 
patala,  sillea  and  tinduka  trees,1  it  is  indeed  terrifying." 

The  highly  resplendent  Sage  Vishwamitra  hearing  these  words, 
said :  "  My  son,  I  will  tell  thee  something  of  this  dark  forest. 
Formerly  there  were  two  cities  named  Malava  and  Karusha,  they 
were  both  prosperous  and  resembled  the  cities  built  by  the  gods. 
O  Rama,  in  ancient  times,  Indra  slew  the  wicked  Vritrasura 
then,  being  hungry  and  thirsty,  he  went  to  an  inauspicious 
and  isolated  place  where  he  became  distressed  on  account  of 
the  sin  of  having  slain  a  brahmin.  The  gods  and  holy  sages 
bathed  Indra  in  the  sacred  waters  of  the  Ganges,  and  purged 
away  his  sin  by  pouring  jars  of  water  charged  with  mantrams 
over  him.  In  this  way,  the  remorse  of  Indra  was  appeased, 
the  pollution  caused  by  slaying  a  brahmin  was  washed  away 
and  he  was  highly  gratified.  Purified  and  sinless,  Indra  gladly 
conferred  a  boon  on  this  land  saying :  '  These  two  cities  will 
be  known  as  Malava  and  Karusha  and  they  will  acquire  great 
renown,  their  prosperity  will  be  famed  throughout  the  earth.' 

"  When  Indra  thus  favoured  these  two  cities,  the  celestial 
beings  praised  him  and  cried :  *  Be  it  so.'  These  two  places 
soon  enjoyed  great  prosperity  and  fame.  In  the  course  of  time, 
a  perverse  yakshini1  was  born  here,  possessing  the  strength  of 
a  thousand  elephants.  Her  name  was  Taraka,  the  wife  of  Sunda, 
and  her  son  was  the  rakshasa,  Maricha,  who  was  equal  in  strength 
to  Indra  himself.  He  possessed  long  arms,  an  enormous  mouth, 
and  a  gigiantic  body.  This  terrible  rakshasa  continually  destroys 
the  people  of  these  two  lands. 

"  O  Rama,  the  wicked  Taraka  constantly  plunders  and 
devastates  these  two  countries.  Obstructing  the  road,  she  lives 
at  two  miles  distance  from  here;  let  us  enter  the  forest  of 
Taraka.  By  my  command,  O  Rama,  do  thou  slay  the  wicked 
yakshini  and  set  the  country  free.  O  Rama,  none  dares  to 
come  hither  for  fear  of  Taraka;  save  this  land  from  the 
dangerous  demoness.  This  is  why  this  forest  is  uninhabited, 
but  thou  can'st  restore  it.  This  wicked  yakshini  is  unceasingly 
bent  on  her  evil  designs."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    25 

Vishwamitra  seeks  to  convince  Rama  that  it  is  his  duty 
to  slay  Taraka 

Hearing  the  words  of  Shri  Vishwamitra,  Shri  Rama  of  limitless 
power  and  influence  uttered  the  following  auspicious  words : — 

"  O  Great  Sage,  it  is  said  that  the  yakshinis  have  little  power, 
then  how  is  it  that  Taraka  has  come  to  possess  the  strength 
of  a  thousand  elephants  ?  " 

The  mahatma  listened  to  Rama's  words  and  said :  "  O  Prince, 
I  will  relate  the  story  to  thee.  This  female  demon  has  acquired 
her  great  strength  by  virtue  of  a  boon  which  she  received. 
In  the  past,  a  powerful  yaksha  by  the  name  of  Suketu,  who  was 
virtuous  but  childless,  performed  many  yogic  practices  which 
pleased  Shri  Brahma,  who  promised  him  a  daughter  by  name 
Taraka,  and  conferred  on  her  the  strength  of  a  thousand 
elephants.  But  the  most  illustrious  Brahma  did  not  grant  a  son 
to  that  yaksha.  When  the  daughter  grew  up  and  possessed 
both  the  charm  of  youth  and  great  beauty,  her  father  gave  her 
in  marriage  to  Sunda,  the  son  of  Jambha.  After  some  time, 
the  yakshini  gave  birth  to  a  son.  His  name  was  Marietta  and  he 
was  very  powerful ;  though  born  of  yaksha  parentage  he  became 
a  rakshasa  through  a  curse.  O  Rama,  when  the  Sage  Agastya 
condemned  Sunda  to  death  by  cursing  him,  then  Taraka  and 
her  son  wished  to  devour  the  sage.  Seeing  her  running  towards 
him,  the  blessed  Sage  Agastya  cursed  Maricha  and  said '  Become 
a  demon '.  He  also  cursed  that  wicked  woman  so  that  she 
became  a  cannibal  with  a  hideous  countenance.  Shri  Agastya 
said :  *  May  thy  beauty  vanish  and  mayest  thou  become  a 
terrible  rakshasi.'  Then  Taraka,  transported  with  anger  under 
this  curse,  began  to  destroy  this  sacred  land  because  it  was  here 
that  the  Sage  Agastya  performed  his  yogic  practices. 

"  O  Rama,  thou  must  slay  this  wicked  and  impious  demon 
Taraka,  who  ravages  the  land.  For  the  good  of  the  brahmins 
and  the  king,  O  Raghava,  accomplish  this ;  do  not  hesitate 
to  destroy  this  vile  yakshini.  It  is  the  duty  of  a  warrior  to 
protect  those  of  the  four  castes.  A  prince  must  not  eschew

BALA    KANDA 

deeds  that  are  painful  and  difficult,  for  the  preservation  of  his 
people.  It  is  according  to  the  law  of  eternal  dharma,  O  Rama, 
that  even  deeds  that  appear  ruthless,  are  permitted  to  those 
appointed  to  protect  their  subjects.  O  Raghava,  Taraka  is 
wholly  evil,  and  therefore  must  be  destroyed.  It  is  said  that 
in  the  past  Manthara,  a  daughter  of  King  Virochana,  was  slain 
by  Indra  because  she  was  the  cause  of  the  destruction  of  others. 
The  blessed  Lord  Vishnu  Himself  slew  the  wife  of  the  Sage 
Bhrigu,  devoted  to  her  husband,  and  the  mother  of  Shukra 
because  she  was  intent  on  killing  Indra.  Many  other  great- 
souled  princes  of  old  also  condemned  wicked  women  to  death. 
Therefore,  it  is  for  thee  to  fulfil  thy  duty  and  slay  this  yakshini 
without  delay."

The  son  of  Dasaratha,  firm  in  his  vows,  listened  to  the  inspiring 
words  of  the  Sage  Vishwamitra,  which  filled  him  with  ardour, 
and  with  joined  palms  he  humbly  addressed  him : — 

"  To  fulfil  the  commands  of  my  royal  sire  and  to  honour  his 
promise,  I  deem  it  my  duty  to  act  according  to  thy  instructions 
without  hesitation.  My  father,  the  emperor,  at  the  time  of  my 
departure  from  Ayodhya  bade  me  carry  out  thy  injunctions 
— O  Muni,  I  shall  honour  them.  I  am  prepared  to  execute 
thy  commands,  O  Rishi,  because  it  will  lead  to  the  benefit 
of  the  brahmins  and  the  king,  and  will  also  bring  happiness 
to  the  people  of  this  land." 

Having  spoken  thus,  Shri  Rama  grasped  his  bow  and, 
twanging  the  string,  filled  all  the  cardinal  points  with  the  sound. 
The  denizens  of  the  forest  were  terrified,  and  Taraka  was 
overcome  with  helpless  rage.  Full  of  wrath  that  yakshini  ran 
in  the  direction  from  which  the  sound  came  and  Shri  Rama- 
chandra  beholding  that  gigantic  and  misshapen  monster  was 
incensed  and  said  to  Lakshmana :  "  O  Brother,  behold  this 
57 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

fearful  yakshini  of  formidable  size,  whose  very  aspect  would 
strike  terror  into  timorous  hearts.  See,  O  Lakshmana,  how  I 
shall  cut  off  her  ears  and  nose  and  put  her  to  flight !  She  is 
horrible,  versed  in  black  magic  and  hard  to  subdue,  but  it  is 
not  proper  to  deprive  a  woman  of  her  life.  A  woman  is  worthy 
of  protection,  therefore,  I  shall  incapacitate  her,  by  depriving 
her  of  the  power  of  motion  thus  preventing  her  from  doing 
further  mischief/* 

While  Shri  Rama  was  still  speaking,  the  dreadful  Taraka  ran  to- 
wards him  roaring  with  uplifted  arms.  The  Rishi  Vishwamitra 
approaching  her  encouraged  Rama,  with  a  shout,  crying,  "  Jai 
to  the  descendant  of  Raghu  ".  Notwithstanding,  Taraka  raised 
a  thick  cloud  of  dust  and  for  a  while  Shri  Rama  and  Lakshmana 
could  see  nothing.  Then  the  yakshini  by  the  power  of  magic 
caused  a  shower  of  rocks  to  rain  on  the  two  brothers  and  Rama 
was  now  filled  with  wrath.  Parrying  the  rain  of  rocks  and 
advancing  towards  her,  he  cut  off  both  her  hands.  Then  Shri 
Lakshmana  severed  the  nose  and  ears  of  the  asuri  who  had 
already  been  deprived  of  her  hands.  Assuming  various  forms, 
she  tried  to  deceive  the  princes  by  vanishing  away.  Then  from 
her  hiding  place,  she  showered  heavy  rocks  on  them,  and  a  rain 
of  stones  fell  on  every  side. 

Shri  Vishwamitra,  who  stood  watching  the  combat,  now  cried : 
"  Enough,  she  does  not  deserve  further  mercy ;  should'st  thou 
spare  her,  she  will  gain  strength  through  her  magic  powers 
and  will  again  break  up  our  holy  rites.  The  evening  is 
approaching  and  in  the  evening  rakshasas  are  overcome  with 
difficulty ;  slay  her,  therefore,  without  delay." 

Then  Shri  Vishwamitra  pointed  out  the  concealed  yakshini 
to  Rama,  who  drew  from  his  quiver  arrows  capable  of  following 
sound  and  surrounded  her  with  them.  The  powerful  female 
demon,  an  adept  in  occult  powers,  encompassed  by  the  rain 
of  arrows,  advanced  roaring,  towards  the  princes.  With  an 
arrow,  Shri  Rama  pierced  the  heart  of  the  wicked  yakshini, 
who  fell  to  the  ground  and  expired.  Seeing  the  terrible  yakshini 
slain,  Indra  and  other  celestial  beings  worshipped  Shri  Rama, 
crying :  "  Well  done,  well  done,  O  Holy  Rama !  "  All  the  gods 
filled  with  joy,  said  to  Shri  Vishwamitra :  "  O  Muni,  may 
prosperity  attend  thee,  Indra  and  the  gods  are  gratified  with

Shri  Ramachandra's  feat  of  arms,  show  thy  special  favour  to  him 
and  deliver  to  him  the  two  kinds  of  weapons,  natural  and  super- 
natural, belonging  to  Krishashwa.  Present  Shri  Ramachandra, 
who  is  worthy  to  receive  them,  with  all  the  other  mighty 
weapons,  he  is  wholly  devoted  to  thee ;  these  two  princes  are 
destined  to  achieve  great  things." 

Having  uttered  these  words,  the  gods  bowed  down  to  the 
Sage  Vishwamitra  and  returned  to  their  abode. 

Evening  fell,  and  the  holy  sage  gladdened  by  the  slaying  of 
the  wicked  Taraka  by  Shri  Rama,  smelt  the  head  of  the  prince 
and  addressed  him  thus :  "  O  Rama,  this  night  we  will  remain 
here  and  to-morrow  morning  proceed  to  my  hermitage." 

Shri  Rama  rejoiced  to  hear  the  muni's  words  and  rested  happily 
during  the  night  in  the  forest. 

On  the  day  that  Taraka  was  slain,  the  forest,  freed  from 
the  curse,  adorned  with  champaka,1  ashoka,1  mango  and  other 
trees,  looked  as  charming  as  the  forest  of  Chitraratha.2 

Shri  Ramachandra,  whom  the  siddhas  praised  for  slaying 
Taraka,  passed  the  night  in  the  forest,  awaiting  the  dawn. 


CHAPTER    27 

Shi  Rama  is  given  the  celestial  weapons 

Having  passed  the  night  resting  in  the  forest,  the  illustrious 
Sage  Vishwamitra  spoke  to  Rama  smilingly,  in  sweet  accents : — 

"  O  Prince  of  Great  Renown,  I  am  entirely  satisfied  with  thee 
and  am  happy  to  give  thee  these  weapons  by  means  of  which 
thou  shalt  be  able  to  conquer  and  subdue  all  thine  enemies, 
whether  devas,  asuras  or  nagas.8  Accept  these  divine  weapons,4

the  Disc  of  Dharma,  the  Kala  weapon,  the  Disc  of  Vishnu  and 
the  irresistible  Weapon  of  Indra.  0  Great  Prince,  here  is  the 
Mace  and  the  Spear  of  Mahendra  the  Brahma-  Shira  and  the 
Ishika.  O  Mighty-armed  One,  take  the  Shankara  weapon  and 
the  two  great  maces  Koumoduki  and  Lohitamukhi.  O  Great 
Prince  receive  also  the  mighty  Dharma-pasha,  the  Kala-pasha 
and  the  Varuna-pasha  and  two  other  maces  called  Shoshka  and 
Ashani ;  the  Pinaka  weapon,  the  Narayana  weapon  and  the 
fire-emitting  weapon  Agneya. 

"  O  Rama,  take  this  wind  weapon,  Vayuvya,  and  the  horse- 
headed  weapon,  Hayashira,  also  the  Krauncha  weapon.  I  give 
thee  further  two  powers  and  the  weapons  called  Kankala, 
Mushala,  Rapala  and  Kinkini.  O  Mighty  Prince,  I  confer  on 
thee  the  two  supernatural  weapons  named  Vidyadhara  and 
Nandana,  useful  in  fighting  the  Asuras. 

"  Take  this  jewel  among  swords,  which  I  give  to  thee,  O 
Mighty-armed  One,  and  another  supernatural  weapon  named 
Gandharva,  and  here,  O  Rama,  is  one  very  dear  to  me  called 
Manava.  Here  are  Prashaman,  Soura,  Praswaprana,  Darpana 
and  that  which  has  the  power  of  drying  up,  and  the  pain- 
inflicting  weapon  causing  lamentation.  I  grant  thee  also  the 
strength  to  bear  the  Madana-astra  presented  to  me  by  Kandarpa 
which  creates  in  man  unbearable  sexual  desire  so  that  he  is 
unable  to  fight.  Here  also  is  the  Paisha-astra  and  the  Mohan- 
astra. 

"  O !  Illustrious  Prince,  receive  also  the  weapon  that  produces 
inertia,  and  the  great  Saumana  weapon.  O  Great  Prince,  here 
are  the  Samvartta,  Moushalya,  Sattyastra  and  Mayadhara,  and 
take  the  Tajaprabha  by  means  of  which  the  strength  and  courage 
of  the  foe  are  withdrawn,  and  also  the  Shishira  which  chills  and 
the  Somastra  and  Twashtra. 

"  0  Rama,  now  thou  art  all-powerful  and  knowest  the  secrets 
of  magic,  yet  take  the  Bava,  Shitesu  and  Manava  astra  also. 
O  Prince,  receive  the  Paramodara-astra,  take  all  these  weapons 
from  me." 

Then  the  great  Visbwamitra  turned  his  face  to  the  east  and 
performed  the  purificatory  rites  with  joy,  conferring  on  Rama 
the  mantrams1  for  employing  the  weapons  and  instructing  him 

1  Mantraraa — sacred  formulas.

in  the  methods  unknown  even  to  the  gods.  All  these  weapons 
did  Shri  Vishwamitra  confei  on  Rama,  and  he,  repeating  the 
appropriate  mantrams,  caused  their  presiding  deities  to  appear 
before  him.  Approaching  with  joined  palms,  they  said  :  "  O 
Prince  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  we  are  thy  servants  and  will  obey 
thy  behests." 

Shri  Rama,  having  surveyed  and  blessed  them,  answered : 
"  Come  and  serve  me  when  I  summon  you." 

Thereafter,  Shri  Ramachandra  offering  salutations  to  the 
venerable  Sage  Vishwamitra,  said :  "  Let  us  proceed  further, 
my  Lord." 


chapter  28 

He  is  instructed  in  their  use 

Having  received  the  weapons  and  instructions  for  their  use, 
Shri  Rama  addressed  the  sage  in  charming  accents  as  they 
proceeded  onward. 

He  said :  "  O  Blessed  One,  by  thy  grace,  I  have  received 
weapons  which  even  the  devas  and  asuras  cannot  easily  obtain. 
Be  pleased  to  tell  me  further,  how  I  may  withdraw  these  weapons 
when  they  are  discharged  ?  " 

Then  the  supremely  patient  and  holy  sage  taught  Shri 
Ramachandra  the  method  of  withdrawing  the  mantra-propelled 
weapons  and  gave  him  more  by  the  name  of  Satya-vana, 
Satya-kirti,  Dhrishta,  Raphasa,  Fratiharatara,  Parangmukha, 
Avangmukha,  Lakshya,  Alakshya,  Drirnabha  and  Sunabhuka, 
Dasharsha,  Shutavaktra,  Dasha-shirsha,  Shatodara,  Dharma- 
nabha  and  Maha-nabha,  Dunda-nabha  and  Swanabhuka, 
Jyotisha  and  Shakuna  and  the  two  weapons  Nirashya  and 
Vimala,  also  the  Yogandhara  and  Vinidra,  Ditya  and  Praman- 
thana,  Shuchivahu,  Mahavanu,  Nishkali,  Virucha,  Sarchi-mali 
Dhrio'  and  Mali,  Vrittiman  and  Ruchira,  Pitryia  and  Soamanas- 
vidhuta  and  Makara,  Karavira  with  Rati,  Dhana  and  Dhanya. 

The  holy  sage  said,  "  O  Rama,  receive  also  Kamarupa, 
Kamaruchi,  Moha  and  Avarana,  also  Jrim  Bhala,  Sarpa-natha 
61

with  Sandhana  and  Varuna.  Receive  from  me,  O  Rama,  the 
Krishashwa  which  assumes  any  form — O  Prince,  mayest  thou 
be  triumphant,  thou  art  worthy  to  possess  these  weapons ". 
Shri  Rama  answered  "  May  it  be  so,  my  Lord  ". 

The  holy  rishi1  then  placed  the  divine  weapons  before  Rama, 
some  of  which  shone  like  fire,  others  with  the  colour  of  smoke 
and  yet  others  which  resembled  the  sun  and  moon.  With 
joined  palms  the  deities  presiding  over  them  addressed  Shri 
Rama  with  submission,  saying :  "  O  Prince,  we  are  at  thy 
service,  what  would'st  thou  have  us  accomplish  ?  "  Shri  Rama 
answered :  "  When  called  to  mind  in  the  time  of  need,  grant 
me  aid,  now  depart,  all  of  yon." 

Offering  obeisance  to  Shri  Ramachandra,  they  replied :  "  Be 
it  so,  my  Lord,"  and  returned  to  their  abode. 

Shri  Rama  then  questioned  the  great  rishi,  saying :  "  O 
Spiritual  Sovereign,  what  is  this  that  resembles  a  dark  cloud 
near  the  mountain  ?  It  would  seem  to  be  a  grove  of  trees, 
pleasing  to  the  sight,  filled  with  deer.  I  hear  birds  singing 
sweetly,  have  we  then  passed  the  dangerous  forest  which  was 
a  cause  of  fear  ?  O  Lord,  let  us  rest  here  at  peace ;  tell  me, 
whose  hermitage  is  this  ?  O  Great  Muni,  are  we  now  in  thine 
own  hermitage,  where  the  wicked  demons,  the  slayers  of 
brahmins  obstruct  thy  sacrifice  ?  O  Blessed  One,  be  pleased 
to  show  me  the  place  of  thy  sacrifice.  O  Wise  One*  I  will 
slay  the  meddlesome  demons  who  hinder  thy  devotions.  Be 
gracious  enough  to  enlighten  me  in  the  matter,  O  Sage." 


CHAPTER    29 

Vishwamitra  relates  the  story  of  Us  hermitage

To  die  most  glorious  Shri  Ramachandra  making  enquiry 
concerning  the  forest,  the  illustrious  Sage  Vishwamitra  made 
answer : — 

1  Rishi — an  illumined  sage,  who  has  bad  a  vision  of  Truth  or  Reality.

BALA    KANDA 

"  O  Rama,  this  is  the  place  at  which  the  Blessed  Lord  Vishnu, 
the  first  among  the  gods,  dwelt,  observing  his  yogic  practices 
for  immeasurable  years  and  previous  to  that,  it  belonged  to 
the  glorious  Vamana.1  This  spot  is  called  Siddha-ashrama, 
for  here,  these  great  souls  practised  austerities  with  success. 
At  that  time,  Bali  the  son  of  King  Virochana,  conquered  Indra 
and  other  devas,  together  with  the  deities  of  the  wind  and  he 
ruled  over  the  three  worlds.  When  Bali  initiated  a  sacrifice, 
the  devas,  under  the  leadership  of  Agni1  approached  Shri 
Vishnu  in  this  hermitage  and  said :  *  O  Lord,  the  son  of 
Virochana,  King  Bali  is  observing  a  great  sacrifice ;  while  it 
is  yet  incomplete,  come  to  our  aid.  The  Lord  grants  the 
requests  of  those  who  seek  His  favour,  therefore,  by  the  power 
of  Thy  Yoga  and  for  our  own  good,  take  the  form  of  a  dwarf 
(Vamana)  and  secure  our  welfare.'  Meantime,  O  Rama,  the 
Sage  Kashyapa,  resplendent  as  fire,  who  was  endowed  with 
supreme  lustre  by  virtue  of  his  yogic  practices,  with  his  spouse 
Aditi,  having  completed  a  thousand  years'  austerities,  began  to 
praise  Madhusudana,  the  conferrer  of  boons,  saying :  '  O 
Supreme  Purusha,8  Thou  art  adored  through  austerity  and  Thou 
dost  grant  the  fruit  of  austerity,  Thy  nature  is  knowledge  and 
asceticism,  it  is  by  virtue  of  austerity  that  I  behold  Thee.  O 
Lord,  in  Thy  body  I  see  the  whole  world  animate  and  inanimate. 
In  Thee  Who  art  beginningless  and  indescribable,  I  take  refuge.' 

"  The  blessed  Vishnu  was  pleased  with  this  prayer  and  said 
to  the  sinless  Sage :  '  O  Kashyapa,  mayest  thou  see  perfection, 
thou  hast  merited  a  boon,  ask  what  thou  desirest.' 

"  Then  Kashyapa,  the  son  of  Marichi,  answered :  *  O  Blessed 
Lord,  Aditi,  the  gods  and  I  beseech  Thee  to  grant  this  boon 
— Become  the  son  of  my  sinless  wife  and  myself.  O  Lord, 
become  the  younger  brother  of  Indra  and  assist  the  sorrow- 
stricken  devas.  This  spot,  by  Thy  grace,  shall  then  be  known 
as  Siddha-Ashrama.'    (Hermitage  of  the  Perfect  Ones.) 

"  Upon  this,  the  resplendent  Vishnu  was  born  of  the  womb 
of  Aditi  as  the  incarnation  Vamana  and  disguised  as  a  mendicant, 
he  approached  King  Bali.    Of  him,  he  requested  a  piece  of 

1  Vamana — An  incarnation  of  Shri  Vishnu  as  the  holy  Dwarf. 
»  Agni — The  god  of  fire. 

1  Purusha — The  Supreme  Being,  the  Soul  of  the  Universe.  Literally  the  Lord 
of  the  body,  called  the  city  of  the  nine  gates.

ground  that  could  be  covered  by  three  strides,  and  having  obtained 
what  he  asked,  he  covered  the  whole  universe  in  three  steps. 

"  This  restful  hermitage  formerly  belonging  to  Vamana, 
whose  devotee  I  am,  is  enjoyed  by  me.  Here  the  rakshasas 
wreak  destruction.  O  Lion  among  men,  remain  here  and  slay 
them.  O  Rama,  to-day  let  us  enterthe  Siddha-Ashrama  together. 
O  Friend,  this  hermitage  is  not  only  mine  but  thine  also." 

Accompanied  by  Shri  Ramachandra  and  Lakshmana,  the 
holy  sage  entered  the  hermitage,  which  appeared  as  beautiful 
as  the  autumn  moon  attended  by  the  planet  Punarvasu.1  When 
the  sages  dwelling  in  the  Siddha-Ashrama  perceived  Shri 
Vishwamitra,  they  rose  and  saluted  him  with  joy.  Having  duly 
honoured  the  resplendent  sage,  they  entertained  the  princes  in 
a  fitting  manner. 

Having  rested  awhile,  the  two  princes  humbly  and  respectfully 
addressed  the  holy  sage,  saying :  "  O  Great  Sage,  inaugurate 
thy  sacrifice  to-day,  may  it  be  attended  with  good  fortune. 
This  place  is  the  Siddha-Ashrama,  we  wish  thee  success  in  thy 
undertaking." 

Thereupon  the  great  sage  with  due  preparation,  his  mind 
subdued,  began  the  sacrifice  while  the  two  princes  kept  vigil. 
Having  passed  the  night  in  this  manner,  in  accordance  with 
the  prescribed  rules,  they  performed  their  ablutions,  repeating 
the  mantram  silently,  they  then  paid  respect  to  Shri  Vishwamitra 
and  occupied  their  seats  as  do  those  performing  a  fire-sacrifice.

The  two  princes,  knowing  what  was  appropriate  in  respect  to 
time  and  place  and  skilled  in  the  art  of  conquering  their  foes, 
uttered  words  fitting  to  the  place  and  occasion. 

1  Punarvasu — The  seventh  of  the  lunar  aiterisms,  called  Nakshatras  or  wives

They  said:  "0  Blessed  One,  we  desire  to  hear  at  what 
moment  in  the  course  of  the  sacrifice,  the  two  demons  appear  ? 
It  is  essential  for  us  to  be  acquainted  with  the  matter,  to  forestall 
their  attack." 

The  dwellers  in  the  Siddha-ashrama,  hearing  the  words  of 
the  princes,  and  finding  them  eager  to  fight  the  demons,  praised 
them  saying :  "  O  Princes,  from  now  on,  keep  watch  over  the 
sacrifice  for  six  days  j  the  Sage  Vishwamitra  having  begun  the 
rite  will  observe  a  strict  silence  during  that  time." 

On  this,  the  two  illustrious  princes  kept  watch  in  the  Tapovana 
forest  continuously  for  six  days  without  sleeping.  Armed  with 
bow  and  arrows  they  guarded  the  rishi  and  his  sacrifice  with 
firm  resolve.  Five  days  passed  without  interruption  and  on 
the  sixth  day  Shri  Ramachandra  said  to  Lakshmana  :  "  Brother, 
be  prepared  to-day." 

As  Shri  Rama  uttered  these  words  concerning  the  approaching 
conflict  with  the  demons,  the  altar  fire  blazed  up  suddenly. 
The  officiating  brahmin,  the  priest  and  Shri  Vishwamitra,  who 
were  watching,  beheld  all  the  sacrificial  implements  set  on  fire. 

The  sacrifice  of  the  holy  sage  still  proceeding,  a  great  and 
fearful  clamour  resounded  in  the  firmament.  As  in  the  rainy 
season,  clouds  cover  the  sky,  so  the  demons  by  the  power  of 
magic  began  to  course  through  the  air. 

Maricha  and  Suvahu  and  other  demons  surrounding  the  altar, 
let  fall  torrents  of  blood.  Seeing  the  altar  deluged  with  blood, 
Shri  Ramachandra  and  Lakshmana  were  filled  with  anger  and 
ran  to  discover  the  cause.  Then  they  saw  Maricha  and  other 
demons  in  the  sky.  Raghava  beholding  the  demons  rushing 
towards  him,  said  to  Lakshmana,  "  O  Lakshmana,  see  these 
evil  flesh-eating  demons,  I  shall  destroy  them  with  the  Manava- 
weapon,  as  the  wind  scatters  the  clouds  ". 

So  saying,  Shri  Ramachandra  hurled  the  shining  Manava 
weapon  at  them  and  striking  the  breast  of  Maricha,  inflicted 
a  wound.  Thus  smitten,  the  demon  was  flung  into  the  sea, 
a  distance  of  a  hundred  miles.  Perceiving  Maricha  reeling, 
struck  senseless  by  the  Manava  weapon,  Shri  Ramachandra 
addressed  Lakshmana,  saying :  "  Behold  the  power  of  this  great 
weapon  created  by  the  muni !  Yet,  though  Maricha  has  been 
deprived  of  his  senses,  he  is  not  dead ;  verily  I  shall  now  destroy 
65 


1HE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

those  wicked,  merciless  and  sinful  blood-drinking  demons  who 
obstruct  the  holy  sacrifice."  So  saying,  he  seized  the  fire- 
weapon  and  discharged  it  at  the  breast  of  Suvahu,  who  straight- 
way fell  to  the  ground  and  expired.  On  this,  Shri  Rama 
destroyed  the  remaining  demons  with  the  air-weapon  (Vayuvya). 

Thus  by  slaying  the  obstructors  of  the  sacrifice  did  Shri 
Ramachandra  bring  delight  to  the  hearts  of  the  sages  and  was 
worshipped  by  them  as  was  formerly  the  victorious  Indra. 

When  the  sacrifice  had  been  successfully  completed,  perceiving 
the  world  to  be  freed  from  the  interference  of  the  asuras,  the 
Rishi  Vishwamitra  said  to  Rama : — 

"  O  Mighty-armed  Prince,  to-day  I  have  fulfilled  my  spiritual 
purpose,  thou  hast  obeyed  the  commands  of  thy  Guru  perfectly, 
truly  thou  hast  made  the  Siddha-Ashrama  worthy  of  its  name." 


CHAPTER    3  I 

Vishwamitra  starts  out  toitk  the  two  princes  to  attend 
King  Janaka's  sacrifice 

The  great  hero,  the  ever-cheerful  Rama,  together  with  Laksh- 
mana  having  successfully  assisted  Shri  Vishwamitra,  passed  the 
night  in  the  hermitage. 

At  dawn,  after  purifying  themselves,  they  approached  Shri 
Vishwamitra  and  offered  obeisance  to  him  and  the  other  sages. 
Bowing  down  before  the  great  muni,  who  was  as  resplendent 
as  a  blazing  fire,  they  addressed  him  in  submissive  tones,  saying : 
"  O  Great  Rishi,  we  are  both  thy  humble  servants,  what  further 
commands  are  there  for  us  ?    We  are  here  to  obey." 

The  other  rishis,  led  by  Shri  Vishwamitra,  listened  to  the 
words  of  Shri  Ramachandra  and  answered  saying :  "  O  Great 
One,  the  King  of  Mithila,  the  righteous  Janaka  is  performing 
a  holy  sacrifice  and  we  shall  attend  it.  O  Great  Beings,  be 
pleased  to  accompany  us ;  there  you  will  see  a  rare  and  wonderful 
bow.  In  ancient  days  this  bow  was  given  by  the  devas  to 
66 


BALA    KANDA 

Janaka,  it  is  exceedingly  heavy  and  splendid.  Neither  gandharvas 
nor  asuras  can  bend  this  great  bow,  how  much  less  man? 
To  test  their  skill,  great  kings  have  come  to  the  assembly  of 
King  Janaka,  but  none  has  succeeded  in  raising  the  bow  and 
stringing  it.  O  Illustrious  One,  let  us  go  and  see  the  sacrifice 
of  the  King  of  Mithila  and  also  that  marvellous  bow.  In  former 
days,  King  Janaka  performed  a  sacrifice  and  the  fruit  of  it  was 
the  great  bow  which  he  obtained  from  the  gods  who  instructed 
him  saying  :  *  Place  this  bow  in  the  sacrificial  chamber  and  let 
it  be  worshipped  with  incense,  perfume  and  lights  \" 

Shri  Vishwamitra  having  related  these  facts,  started  out 
accompanied  by  the  two  princes  and  other  sages.  Invoking 
the  Vanadevata  (Forest  Deity)  he  said  to  him :  "  My  sacrifice 
has  come  to  a  successful  conclusion,  may  happiness  be  thine. 
I  am  leaving  the  Siddha-Ashrama  for  the  banks  of  the  sacred 
river  Gunga  on  the  slopes  of  the  Himalayas,  situated  in  the 
domain  of  King  Janaka." 

Then  the  sage  reverently  circumambulated  the  hermitage  and 
turned  northwards.  As  Shri  Vishwamitra  entered  upon  his 
journey,  the  sages  skilled  in  the  knowledge  of  the  science  of 
Brahman,  accompanied  him  with  their  chattels  placed  on 
hundreds  of  waggons.  The  birds  and  beasts  of  the  hermitage 
also  followed  them  for  a  long  way  until  the  holy  muni  requested 
them  to  turn  back. 

The  sages  and  the  holy  muni  reached  the  banks  of  the  river 
Shona  at  sunset  and,  having  bathed  and  recited  their  evening 
prayers,  performed  the  fire  sacrifice. 

Shri  Ramachandra  and  Prince  Lakshmana  then  offered 
salutations  to  Shri  Vishwamitra  and  the  other  rishis,  and  sat 
down  before  them.  Thereafter  Shri  Rama  cheerfully  enquired : 
"  O  Lord,  what  country  is  this,  covered  with  verdant  groves  ? 
Be  gracious  enough  to  relate  everything  concerning  it." 

The  great  ascetic  of  firm  vows,  was  pleased  to  hear  these 
words  and,  sitting  amidst  the  sages,  he  described  the  country 
fully  to  them. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER    32 

Viskzoamitra  tells  of  his  ancestors  and  the  dynasty 
of  King  Kusha 

"  O  Rama,  in  times  of  yore,  there  was  a  king  named  Kusha, 
he  was  the  son  of  a  brahmin,  a  noted  ascetic,  faithful  to  his  vows, 
conversant  with  dharma  and  ever  revered  by  the  virtuous.  He 
wedded  a  high-born  woman  of  great  beauty  named  Bhidharvi, 
and  begat  four  sons,  each  resembling  himself.  Their  names 
were  Rushamba,  Rushanabha,  Umurita-rajasa  and  Basu ; 
these  four  princes  were  mighty  and  active,  and  desirous  of 
teaching  them  the  duties  of  a  kshatriya,  die  truthful  and  righteous 
King  Kusha  addressed  them  as  follows  : — 

"  *  O  My  Sons,  protect  and  nourish  your  subjects,  this  practice' 
is  productive  of  great  merit.* 

"  In  order  to  carry  out  the  instructions  of  their  sire,  these 
princes  founded  four  cities  and  named  them  after  themselves. 
The  mighty  Kushamba  called  his  city  Kaushambi,  and  the 
righteous  Rushanabha  founded  the  city  of  Mahodaya.  O  Rama, 
Prince  Umurita-rajasa  founded  the  city  named  Dhar-maranya 
and  the  Prince  Basu  called  his  city  Giribrat,  also  named  Basumati. 
This  city  was  surrounded  by  five  mountain  peaks  and  the 
river  Magadhi  or  Shona  meandering  through  the  mountains 
resembled  a  lovely  garland.  O  Rama,  this  stream  the  Magadhi 
flows  towards  the  east  and  irrigates  the  fruitful  fields  on  either 
bank. 

"  O  Prince  of  Raghu,  Rushanabha  took  in  wedlock  a  nymph 
named  Ghritachi  and  by  her  had  one  hundred  beautiful 
daughters,  who  on  reaching  maturity  were  delightful  to  look 
upon.  One  day,  clad  in  lovely  dresses,  in  beauty  of  form  un- 
paralleled they  wandered  in  the  garden  like  lightning  amidst 
the  clouds.  Singing,  dancing  and  playing  on  instruments  they 
seemed  to  be  divine  forms  which  had  materialised  and  des- 
cended on  the  earth,  or  like  the  stars  in  the  firmament. 

"  Seeing  those  lovely  and  virtuous  princesses,  Vayu  the  wind 


BALA    KANDA 

god  thus  addressed  them :  '  I  entreat  you  all  to  be  wedded 
to  me ;  give  up  your  mortal  form,  I  will  render  you  immortal. 
Remember  youth  is  passing  and  youth  among  mortals  passes 
even  more  swiftly ;    weddedtome,youwilibebeautifulforever.' 

"  The  damsels  listened  to  the  improper  speech  of  the  wind 
god  and  replied  mockingly :  *  O  Deity  of  the  Wind,  thou 
knowest  all  that  is  passing  in  the  hearts  of  men,  but  we  know 
what  is  passing  in  thy  heart.  Why  dost  thou  insult  us,  O 
Wind  ?  O  Vayu,  who  art  renowned  for  thy  wisdom,  we  virgins 
by  the  power  of  our  devotion  and  self-control  can  effect  thy 
downfall,  but  because  the  merits  of  the  righteous  come  to  nought 
when  they  cause  harm  to  others,  we  shall  preserve  our  sacred 
vows  inviolate.  O  Stupid  One,  heaven  forfend  that  we  choose 
husbands  for  ourselves  without  first  seeking  the  approval  of  our 
honoured  sire.  He  is  as  a  god  to  us  and  our  master,  and  we 
shall  wed  the  husbands  he  chooses  for  us.* 

"  The  wind  god  was  enraged  and  entering  their  bodies, 
twisted  and  distorted  them.  Thus  afflicted,  the  princesses  in 
tears,  approached  their  father  for  assistance. 

"  The  king  was  grieved  to  sec  his  daughters  in  this  condition 
and  said :  *  O  speak,  what  has  occurred  ?  Who,  disregarding 
justice,  has  deformed  you  ?  Tell  me  all.'  The  monarch  was 
deeply  moved  by  this  event  and  bis  heart  became  heavy." 


chapter  33 

King  Kushanabha's  hundred  daughters 

When  the  hundred  princesses  were  thus  questioned  by  the  king 
their  father,  they  placed  their  heads  at  his  feet  and  answered : 
"  The  wind  god,  who  pervades  all,  has  entered  the  evil  path 
and  desired  us  to  forsake  virtuous  conduct.  We  told  him  we 
were  not  free  to  choose  our  way  of  life  since  our  father  was 
still  living  and  that  he  should  consult  thee  if  he  wished  to  wed 
us,  but  that  sinful  god,  disregarding  our  request  has  twisted 
and  deformed  our  bodies  in  this  manner."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

The  great  king  hearing  the  complaint  of  the  hundred  virgins, 
said  to  them :  "  You  have  acted  nobly  by  practising  forbearance 
towards  the  deity.  It  is  meet  that  the  generous-minded  should 
exercise  forbearance,  you  have  added  to  the  honour  of  our 
dynasty.  Forbearance  is  the  chief  ornament  of  both  man  and 
woman,  you  have  achieved  something  rare ;  few  are  capable 
of  such  forbearance.  O  Virgins,  forbearance  is  charity,  forbear- 
ance is  truth,  forbearance  is  sacrifice.  A  man's  true  glory  is 
forbearance ;  forbearance  is  dharma.  The  world  is  established 
in  forbearance." 

Having  spoken  thus,  the  princesses  were  comforted,  and  the 
king  dismissed  them.  Then  the  monarch,  mighty  like  a  god, 
summoned  his  ministers  and  consulted  them  regarding  the 
alliance  of  his  daughters  to  suitable  families  at  the  proper  time 
and  place. 

Now  a  great  muni  named  Chuli  full  of  glory  derived  from 
prolonged  celibacy  and  highly  virtuous,  was  engaged  in  sacred 
austerities  for  the  purpose  of  spiritual  liberation. 

At  that  place,  the  virgin  daughter  of  the  nymph  Urmila, 
named  Somada,  began  to  minister  to  the  muni.  She  attended 
on  the  great  sage  for  a  long  time  with  undeviating  faith  and 
devotion  and  her  Guru  was  pleased  with  her ;  he  said  to  her : 
"lam  pleased  with  thee,  what  desire  of  thine  shall  I  fulfil  ?  " 

Perceiving  the  muni  to  be  highly  pleased,  that  sweet-voiced 
nymph  acquainted  with  the  art  of  conversation  made  answer 
to  him :  "  O  King  of  Kings,  I  desire  to  bear  a  son,  resplendent 
with  divine  power,  a  worshipper  of  God  and  devoted  to  dharma. 
I  have  no  husband,  nor  do  I  wish  to  be  the  wife  of  any,  as  I 
am  a  brahmacharini,1  therefore,  by  virtue  of  thy  Yoga,  grant  me 
a  son  produced  by  the  power  of  thy  thought." 

The  divine  Sage  Chuli  was  pleased  to  hear  these  words 
and  granted  her  a  son  named  Brahmadatta,  by  the  power  of 
his  mind.  Brahmadatta  became  King  of  Kampila  and  was  as 
prosperous  as  Indra  in  heaven.  King  Kushanabha  resolved  to 
give  his  daughters  in  marriage  to  King  Brahmadatta.  Kushan- 
abha requested  King  Brahmadatta  to  visit  him  and  joyfully 
gave  him  his  daughters  in  marriage.

O  Ramaji,  King  Brahmadatta,  who  was  equal  to  India  in  glory 
wedded  the  princesses  one  by  one  by  taking  their  hands  in  his. 
Through  the  touch  of  his  hand,  the  princesses  were  freed  from 
their  deformity  and  restored  to  their  former  beauty.  When 
King  Kushnabha  beheld  his  daughters  released  from  their 
disfigurement  and  restored  to  their  former  beauty  he  was  filled 
with  joy. 

Thus  did  the  King  Kushnabha  give  his  daughters  in  marriage 
to  King  Brahmadatta  and  then  commanded  their  preceptors 
to  accompany  them  to  the  court  of  his  son-in-law. 

Somada  was  delighted  with  the  union  of  her  son  to  the 
damsels  and  receiving  them  with  great  affection,  commended 
the  virtuous  King  Kushanabha. 


chapter   34 

His  son,  Gadhi,  is  the  father  of  Vishwamitra 

"  O  RAMAJI,  after  the  wedding  of  his  daughters,  the  sinless 
King  Kushanabha  prepared  to  perform  a  sacrifice  in  order  to 
obtain  a  son. 

"At  the  inauguration  of  the  sacrifice,  the  munificent  King 
Kusha,  son  of  Shri  Brahma,  said  to  Kushanabha :  '  O  my  Son, 
thou  wilt  obtain  a  son  like  thyself,  he  should  be  named  Gadhi, 
he  will  bring  thee  immortal  renown.' 

"After  some  time  a  son  was  born  to  the  wise  King  Kushanabha 
who  was  a  lover  of  virtue,  and  his  name  was  Gadhi.  This 
Gadhi,  O  Rama,  was  my  virtuous  father1  and  because  I  was 
born  in  the  family  of  Kusha  I  was  called  Kaushika. 

"  I  had,  O  Prince,  an  elder  sister  named  Satyavati,  who 
became  the  faithful  spouse  of  Richika.  When  her  lord  died, 
she  ascended  to  heaven  and  took  the  form  of  the  Kaushiki  river. 
The  river  is  sacred  and  beautiful,  and  its  waters  confer  merit 
on  men.  To  bless  the  world  Satyavati  became  the  river  Sowing 
near  the  Himalayas.

"  O  Prince,  through  lore  of  my  sister,  I  dwell  on  the  banks 
of  the  Kaushiki  river  near  the  Himalayas. 

"  Established  in  truth,  faithful  to  her  lord,  that  sister  of  mine, 
named  Satyavati  is  to-day  the  river  Kaushiki,  great  among 
streams  and  highly  fortunate. 

"  O  Rama,  in  order  to  perform  a  sacrifice,  I  went  to  the 
Siddha  ashrama,  I  have  now  accomplished  my  purpose. 

"  O  Rama,  at  thy  instance,  I  have  told  thee  of  my  family 
and  origin  ;  the  night  is  far  spent  in  listening  to  this  tele,  now 
rest,  so  that,  refreshed,  we  may  resume  our  journey  to-morrow. 
Peace  be  with  thee  I 

"  The  leaves  of  the  trees  are  motionless,  the  birds  and  beasts 
are  silent  and  darkness  covers  all.  How  imperceptibly  the 
evening  has  passed  away.  The  sky  is  brilliant  with  stars,  as  if 
a  thousand  eyes  gazed  down  on  us. 

"  The  bright  moon  with  its  cool  beams,  slowly  rising  higher 
and  higher  dispels  the  darkness.  Nocturnal  wanderers  and  the 
terrible  flesh-eating  yakshas  prowl  about  here  and  there." 

Having  uttered  these  words,  the  great  Sage  Vishwamitra 
became  silent.  The  other  munis  praised  him  saying :  "  Well 
spoken,  well  spoken,  O  Sage." 

They  said:  "The  dynasty  of  Kusha  has  ever  practised 
righteousness  and  the  kings  of  this  line  have  been  eminent  in 
virtue.  Of  this  dynasty,  thou,  O  Vishwamitra,  art  the  most 
illustrious,  the  fame  of  this  royal  line  has  been  enhanced  by 
the  beautiful  river  Kaushiki." 

Thus  did  the  great  sages  praise  the  Rishi  Vishwamitra,  who 
then  withdrew  to  rest,  as  the  sun  sets  behind  a  mountain. 

Shri  Ramachandra  and  his  brother  Lakshmana,  full  of  wonder 
also  made  obeisance  to  the  holy  sage  and  retired  to  sleep.

CHAPTER    35 


Vishwamitra  begins  to  narrate  the  origin  of  the  holy 
river  Gunga 

Having  passed  the  night  with  the  other  munis  on  the  banks 
of  the  river  Shona,  Shri  Vishwamitra  said  to  Prince  Rama  at 
daybreak :  "Arise,  O  Prince,  the  day  has  dawned,  may  prosperity 
attend  thee  !  Perform  thy  morning  devotions  and  let  us  prepare 
for  our  journey." 

Shri  Rama  listened  to  the  instructions  of  the  holy  sage, 
recited  his  morning  prayers  and  prepared  to  leave,  saying: 
"  O  Knower  of  God,  the  waters  of  the  holy  river  Shona  appear 
to  be  very  shallow  and  rest  on  a  sandy  bed,  be  pleased  to  instruct 
us  where  we  should  cross  over  it." 

The  sage  replied :  "  O  Prince,  I  will  show  thee  where  the 
great  rishis  traversed  it."  Thereafter  they  forded  the  river 
and  journeyed  on  and  on,  enjoying  the  many  beautiful  woods 
and  forests  through  which  they  passed. 

After  proceeding  a  great  distance,  late  one  afternoon,  they 
reached  the  holy  river  Ganges,  beloved  of  the  sages.  On 
beholding  the  lovely  river  rendered  beautiful  by  the  presence 
of  swans  and  cranes,  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  the  sages  were 
filled  with  delight. 

They  halted  on  the  banks  and  bathed  in  the  sacred  river  as 
prescribed  by  the  holy  ordinance,  then  lighting  their  sacrificial 
fires  they  partook  of  the  remains  of  the  offerings.  According 
to  the  tradition,  they  offered  water  to  their  ancestors  and 
spreading  coverings,  seated  themselves  by  the  holy  Ganges. 

Sitting  in  the  midst  of  the  sages  with  the  two  princes  before 
him,  Shri  Vishwamitra  was  questioned  by  Shri  Rama  in  the 
following  manner : — 

"  O  Lord,  I  desire  to  hear  the  story  of  this  holy  river,  which 
traverses  the  three  paths.1  How  does  the  sacred  Gunga, 
passing  through  the  three  worlds  merge  at  last  in  the  ocean  ? " 

1  In  Hindu  mythology  the  universe  is  divided  into  the  three  worlds  :  Bhur, 
Bhuvah,  Swah,  the  lower,  middle  and  upper  worlds.  The  sacred  river  is  said 
to  traverse  all  three. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

On  this  request,  Shri  Vishwamitra  began  to  narrate  the  origin 
and  genesis  of  the  sacred  river. 

"  O  Rama,  the  great  Himavat,  Lord  of  the  Himalayas,  the 
treasury  of  all  precious  metals,  had  two  daughters,  who  were 
unsurpassed  in  loveliness  on  earth.  Their  mother  Mena,  the 
wife  of  Himachala  (Himavat)  was  the  daughter  of  Mount  Meru. 
Her  elder  daughter  was  named  Gunga  and  the  younger  Uma. 

"  The  devas  wishing  to  observe  certain  sacred  rites,  asked 
for  Shri  Gunga  to  promote  the  success  of  their  undertaking 
and  with  the  permission  of  her  father,  took  her  away  with  them. 

"  Himachala,  mindful  of  the  good  of  all  beings,  gave  his 
daughter  Gunga,  the  purifier  of  the  whole  world,  to  the  gods, 
thinking  it  to  be  his  duty  to  do  so.  The  gods  supremely 
gratified  took  bis  daughter  Gunga  and  blessing  all,  left 
Himachala. 

"  O  Prince  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  the  other  daughter  of 
Himachala,  named  Uma,  practised  great  asceticism,  considering 
it  to  be  her  chief  wealth.  Himachala  gave  this  ascetic  daughter 
Uma,  who  was  venerated  by  the  whole  world,  to  Shri  Mahadeva1 
in  marriage,  thinking  him  to  be  a  worthy  consort. 

"  O  Rama,  now  I  have  told  thee  of  the  two  daughters  of 
Himachala,  revered  by  the  whole  world,  the  river  Gunga  and 
Uma  Devi. 

"  O  my  Son,  O  Chief  of  Disciples,  I  have  related  to  thee 
the  story  of  Shri  Gunga  accompanying  the  devas  to  heaven. 
This  beautiful  daughter  of  the  King  of  Himalaya,  once  resident 
in  heaven,  is  the  charming  river  Gunga,  whose  waters  destroy 
all  sin." 


chapter   36 

The  story  of  the  king  of  Himalayas'  younger  daughter  Uma 

Hearing  the  wonderful  narrative,  so  eloquently  related  by  Shri 
Vishwamitra,  both  the  princes  praised  the  holy  sage  and  said  : 
"  O  Divine  Sage,  thou  hast  told  us  a  tale,  by  the  hearing  of

which  great  merit  is  acquired,  be  gracious  enough  to  enlighten 
us  further  regarding  the  elder  daughter  of  the  King  of  Himalaya. 
Thou  art  omniscient,  therefore  describe  to  us  fully,  how  the 
Gunga,  the  world  purifying  stream,  came  down  from  heaven 
to  earth.  O  Thou,  versed  in  the  science  of  dharma,  why  is 
this  sacred  river  called  Tripathaga  (the  Traverser  of  the  Three 
Worlds)  and  whence  is  this  name  derived  ?  " 

Seated  amidst  the  other  sages,  Shri  Vishwamitra,  whose  only 
wealth  was  truth  and  austerity,  spoke  as  follows,  in  answer  to 
Shri  Rama's  questioning : — 

"  O  Prince,  in  ancient  times,  the  holy  Lord  Mahadeva  was 
wedded  to  Parvati1  and  being  charmed  with  her  beauty  devoted 
himself  to  the  delights  of  connubial  bliss.  According  to  the 
measure  of  time  of  the  gods,  the  Lord  Mahadeva  passed  a 
hundred  years  with  that  devis  but  remained  without  issue.  In 
their  anxiety,  the  gods  approached  Shri  Brahma  and  said : — 

"  *  Who  will  be  able  to  endure  the  power  and  glory  of  the 
offspring  produced  by  these  two  mighty  beings  ?  ' 

"  They  then  took  refuge  with  Shri  Mahadeva,  saying :  *  O 
God  of  Gods,  O  Mahadeva,  ever  engaged  in  doing  good  to  all 
beings,  we  offer  salutations  to  thee,  be  gracious  unto  us  !  Thy 
power,  O  First  among  the  Gods,  none  can  endure,  therefore 
with  this  goddess  engage  in  yogic  penances.  For  the  welfare 
of  the  three  worlds,  retain  thine  energy  within  thy  body  so  that 
the  universe  may  be  preserved  and  may  not  suffer  destruction  V 

The  Ruler  of  the  World,  Shri  Mahadeva,  listened  to  the  words 
of  the  devas  and  said :  "  Be  it  so,  O  Devas,  I  will  restrain  my 
power  so  that  all  the  regions  including  the  earth  may  dwell 
in  peace,  but  O  Devas,  should  my  vital  fluid  overflow,  who 
shall  receive  it  ?  " 

The  gods  answered  Shri  Mahadeva,  saying :  "  Let  the  earth 
receive  it." 

Then  Shri  Mahadeva  let  fall  his  seed  on  the  earth  covering 
the  mountains,  seas  and  forests.  When  the  earth  could  bear 
no  more,  the  devas  asked  the  wind  and  Are  deities  to  combine 

1  Parvati — The  consort  of  the  Lord  Shiva. 

*  Devi— another  name  for  Parvati.  Devi  literaljy  means  goddess  or  shining

with  that  creative  power  and  thus  was  a  white  mountain  created 
and  later  a  heavenly  forest  as  resplendent  as  the  light  of  the  sun. 
From  this  fiery  light  was  born  the  glorious  Swami  Karttikeya.1 

"All  the  gods  and  rishis  were  full  of  joy  and  adored  the  Lord 
Shiva  and  the  goddess  Uma.  As  they  worshipped  them  with 
grateful  hearts,  Uma  was  filled  with  wrath  and  said :  *  O  Devas, 
your  action  has  filled  me  with  displeasure,  you  shall  not  escape 
the  consequences.* 

"  Then  Uma  shining  like  the  sun,  took  water  in  the  palm 
of  her  hand  and  pronounced  a  curse  on  the  gods,  saying  ;  '  O 
Devas,  you  have  prevented  me  from  bearing  a  son,  may  you 
be  childless  from  this  day,  may  your  wives  be  without  progeny.* 

"  Still  not  appeased,  Uma  cursed  the  earth  also  and  said : 
'  O  Earth,  thou  shalt  never  remain  in  one  form,  thou  shalt  have 
many  masters.  O  Witless  One,  thou  shalt  never  bear  a  son, 
since  thou  hast  prevented  me  from  becoming  a  mother.' 

"  Shri  Mahadeva,  seeing  the  devas  discomfited,  prepared  to 
depart  to  the  northern  region  of  the  Himalayas.  There,  on  a 
peak  named  Himavatprabhava,  he  engaged  in  prolonged  yogic 
practices  together  with  Uma. 

"  O  Rama,  I  have  told  thee  of  one  of  the  two  daughters  of 
the  Himalayas ;  now  with  Lakshmana,  listen  to  the  tale  of  the 
other  daughter  of  Himalaya,  named  Gunga." 


chapter   37 

The  king's  elder  daughter,  Gunga 

Whilst  Shri  Mahadeva  was  engaged  in  yogic  meditation,  the 
devas,  under  the  leadership  of  Agni,  went  to  the  region  of 
Brahma  where,  with  Indra,  they  paid  reverence  to  the  Lord 
of  the  world,  and  said :  "  O  Lord,  at  the  beginning  of  creation 
thou  did'st  make  Shri  Mahadeva  our  leader,  but  he  has  now 
retired  to  the  Himalayas  and  is  engaged  in  the  practice  of 
austerity  with  Uma.    O  Thou  who  art  desirous  of  the  good

BALA    KANDA 

of  the  world,  do  what  thou  considerest  ought  to  be  done,  thou 
art  our  only  refuge." 

Then  Shri  Brahma  encouraged  the  devas,  with  gentle  words, 
saying :  "  O  Devas,  the  curse  of  Uma  Devi,  that  you  should 
remain  without  offspring  is  irrevocable,  but  the  fire  god  Agni 
will  cause  Gunga  to  bear  a  son  who  will  destroy  the  enemies 
of  the  gods.  The  youngest  daughter  of  Himanchala  (Uma) 
will  look  upon  her  sister's  son  as  her  own  and  will  inevitably 
lavish  her  affection  on  him." 

"  O  Rama,  the  words  of  Shri  Brahma  filled  the  gods  with 
satisfaction  and  they  offered  obeisance  to  him.  Then  they  all 
circumambulated  Mount  Kailasha,"  the  repository  of  precious 
metals,  and  begged  Agni  to  beget  a  son. 

"Agni  acquiesced  in  their  request  and  approaching  Shri 
Gunga,  said :  '  O  Devi,  let  us  beget  a  son  for  it  is  the  wish 
of  the  gods.' 

"Assuming  the  form  of  a  celestial  nymph,  Gunga,  inspired 
the  fire  god  to  plant  his  seed  in  her,  her  every  vein  being  filled 
with  splendour.  After  a  time,  she  addressed  Agni,  saying: 
'  O  Deva,  I  am  unable  to  bear  the  ever-increasing  splendour 
which  thou  hast  communicated  to  me.  My  body  is  burning 
like  fire,  my  mind  is  agitated  and  I  am  filled  with  fear.' 

"Agni  replied :  *  O  Sinless  One,  place  this  foetus  near  the 
Himalayas.' 

"  Then  Gunga  Devi  expelled  the  resplendent  being,  shining 
like  gold.  This  substance,  falling  on  the  earth,  became  the 
purest  gold  that  can  be  found.  All  objects  in  its  proximity 
became  silver  and  the  more  distant  areas  exposed  to  its 
penetrating  rays  became  copper,  the  baser  parts  becoming  zinc 
and  lead.  In  this  way,  its  brilliance  was  transmuted  into  metals 
and  spread  abroad  and  the  mountains  and  forests  near  by  were 
changed  to  gold.  O  Rama,  gold  being  produced  in  that  dazzling 
form  is  called  jatarupa  (form-born)  and,  O  Hero,  that  is  why 
gold  shines  like  fire.  The  grass,  the  creepers,  the  shrubs,  all 
were  converted  into  gold,  and  from  that  splendour  was  born 
Kumara. 

"  The  devas  with  Indra  engaged  the  Krittikas1  to  nurse  the 

1  Mount  Kailasha — said  to  be  the  abode  of  Lord  Shiva. 
■  Krittikas — The  Pleiades,  the  six  nurses  of  the  God  of  War.

child  and  they  regarded  him  as  their  own  son.  The  gods  named 
the  child  Karttikeya  and  said :  *  He  shall  be  our  son  and  he 
will  be  renowned  in  the  three  worlds.* 

"  The  Krittikas  bathed  the  child  and  as  he  grew,  his  form 
resembled  the  fire.  Because  the  infant  was  born  prematurely, 
the  devas  called  him  Skanda. 

"  The  nurses  began  to  nourish  the  child  with  milk  and  he 
shone  like  a  flame.  With  six  mouths  he  sucked  the  milk  of 
six  nurses  at  the  same  time.  Soon  he  grew  so  powerful  that 
while  yet  an  infant  he  challenged  groups  of  demons  to  combat. 
Then  all  the  gods  appointed  him  their  commander-in-chief. 
The  Devas  and  Agni  paid  affectionate  homage  to  this  child. 

"  O  Rama,  this  is  the  inspiring  and  merit-bestowing  story 
of  Shri  Gunga  and  Karttikeya. 

"  O  Raghava,  on  this  earth,  those  who  read  this  narrative 
with  faith  and  devotion  shall  have  long  lives,  sons  and  grandsons 
and  obtain  the  divine  region  of  Skanda." 


CHAPTER    38 

The  story  of  King  Sagara,  Shri  Rama's  ancestor 

Shri  Vishwamitra  in  gentle  accents,  related  this  story  to  Shri 
Ramachandra,  and  then  again  addressed  him,  saying  : — 

"  In  ancient  times  there  lived  a  king  named  Sagara,  who 
ruled  in  Ayodhya.  He  was  brave  and  virtuous  and  a  lover 
of  his  subjects,  yet  he  was  without  issue. 

"  The  name  of  his  chief  queen  was  Keshini,  a  daughter  of 
King  Vidharba ;  she  was  virtuous  and  truthful.  His  second 
queen  was  Sumati,  a  daughter  of  Arishtanemi  and  she  was 
comely  and  charming. 

"  The  king  went  to  the  Himalayas  and  engaged  in  severe 

yogic  practices  in  the  forest  of  Bhrigu-prasravana.    When  he 

had  completed  a  hundred  years'  ascetic  practices,  the  ever 

truthful  Maharishi  Bhrigu  was  pleased  with  him  and  favoured 

78 


BALA    KANDA 

him  with  a  boon.  He  said :  '  O  Sinless  King,  thou  shah  beget 
many  sons  and  thy  fame  will  be  immeasurable.  From  one  of 
thy  queens  shall  be  born  one  son,  and  from  the  other  sixty 
thousand  sons.1 

"  When  the  queens  heard  of  the  boon  granted  by  the  rishi, 
they  approached  him  saying :  '  O  Knower  of  God,  we  are 
certain  that  thy  boon  will  bear  fruit,  please  tell  us  therefore 
which  of  us  will  beget  one  son  and  which  sixty  thousand  ?  ' 

"Hearing  their  words,  the  highly  virtuous  Bhrigu  said: 
*  That  depends  on  your  desires.  Tell  me,  which  of  you  would 
fain  be  the  mother  of  the  founder  of  the  dynasty  and  which 
desires  to  beget  sixty  thousand  illustrious  sons  ? ' 

"  O  Rama,  Queen  Keshini  desired  to  be  favoured  by  one  son 
only,  but  Sumati,  the  sister  of  Garuda1  obtained  the  boon  of 
bearing  sixty  thousand  powerful  and  illustrious  sons. 

"  O  Prince,  the  king  offered  salutations  to  the  Rishi  Bhrigu 
and  with  his  consorts  returned  to  the  capital. 

"  When  the  time  was  ripe,  the  chief  Queen  Keshini  gave  birth 
to  a  son  who  was  called  Asamanjasa. 

"  O  Great  One,  a  gourd  was  brought  forth  by  Queen  Sumati 
from  which,  when  opened,  sixty  thousand  male  infants  emerged. 
The  nurses  placed  them  in  jars  full  of  butter  and  tended  them. 
After  a  long  time  they  attained  to  the  state  of  adolescence, 
and  then  grew  to  manhood. 

"  O  Rama,  the  eldest  son  of  King  Sagara,  Asamanjasa  used 
to  seize  hold  of  children  and  throw  them  into  the  river  Sarayu. 
When  he  saw  them  drowning,  he  rejoiced.  This  evil  doer 
grew  up  to  oppress  the  good  by  his  conduct. 

"The  citizens  of  King  Sagara's  capital  exiled  the  prince, 
thus  passing  judgment  on  him.  Asamanjasa  became  the  father 
of  a  valiant  prince  named  Anshuman,  who  was  esteemed  by 
everyone  and  addressed  every  man  with  courtesy. 

"After  a  long  time,  King  Sagara  resolved  to  perform  a 
sacrifice.  O  Rama,  the  king  summoning  the  high  priests  began 
the  initiatory  rites." 


1  Garuda — a  mythological  bird,  half  man,  half  bird,  the  vehicle  of  Shri  Vishnu, 
and  the  slayer  of  serpents.  Garuda  is  said  to  have  stolen  the  nectar  of  immortality 
from  the  gods,  when  it  was  churned  from  the  ocean.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    39 

The  korse  with  which  he  performs  a  sacrifice  is  stolen 

Having  listened  to  this  tale,  Shri  Rama  addressed  the  Muni 
Vishwamitra,  who  resembled  the  fire  in  splendour,  and  said : 
"  O  Wise  One,  may  prosperity  constantly  attend  thee !  I  desire 
to  hear  how  my  ancestor  King  Sagara  performed  the 
sacrifice." 

Shri  Vishwamitra,  highly  gratified  by  Shri  Rama's  eager 
enquiry,  smilingly  replied :  "  Listen,  0  Rama,  to  the  history 
of  the  high-soul ed  King  Sagara.  There  is  a  country  between 
the  Himalayas  and  the  Vindhya  mountains,  and  it  was  there 
that  King  Sagara  performed  his  sacrifice.  That  land  is  suitable 
for  this  purpose,  O  Great  Prince. 

"  The  great  archer  and  warrior  Anshuman  was  appointed  the 
protector  of  the  horse  released  for  the  sacrifice.  A  rakshasa 
in  disguise,  stole  the  horse  and  when  it  was  being  borne  away, 
the  priests  approached  the  king,  crying :  '  See,  someone  is 
carrying  off  the  horse,  kill  the  thief  and  restore  it.'  The  king 
called  for  his  sixty  thousand  sons  and  said  :  'A  wicked  demon 
has  stolen  the  sacrificial  steed,  in  what  direction  has  he  borne 
it  away?  It  has  been  consecrated  by  mantrams  to  avoid 
obstructions ;  seek  the  horse,  my  sons,  and  may  success  attend 
you.  Scour  the  earth  surrounded  by  the  seas,  and  excavate 
the  earth  at  my  command,  till  the  sacred  horse  is  found. 
Having  taken  the  initiation,  I  cannot  leave  this  place.  Go  Ye, 
My  Sons !  I  shall  remain  here  with  Anshuman  and  the  brahmins.' 

"  O  Rama,  commanded  by  their  father,  those  powerful  princes 
joyfully  started  in  search  of  the  horse.  O  Great  One !  they 
ranged  the  world  in  vain  and  began  to  dig  the  ground  with 
their  nails  which  were  as  sharp  as  diamonds. 

"  O  Prince  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  they  used  ploughs,  spades 
and  other  implements  to  excavate  the  ground  and  the  earth 
shook  with  the  sound.  While  ploughing  up  the  earth,  many 
snakes,  demons  and  powerful  titans  were  slain  and  injured. 

"  O  Raghava,  those  mighty  princes  pierced  the  earth  to  the 
depth  of  sixty  thousand  miles  and  reached  the  antipodes.  Having 
80 


BALA    KANDA 

pierced  the  earth  with  its  mountains,  they  searched  for  the  horse 
in  Jambudwipa.1 

"  The  devasj  gandharvas,  asuras  and  nagas  became  agitated, 
and  approached  Shri  Brahma ;  bowing  before  him  with  their 
minds  afflicted  and  in  great  distress,  they  said :  *  O  Blessed 
Lord,  the  sons  of  the  Maharajah  Sagara  are  digging  up  the 
whole  earth  and  they  have  brought  about  the  death  of  many 
great  beings.  Whosoever  opposes  them  is  slain  with  the  words, 
"  Thou  art  a  thief,  thou  hast  stolen  the  sacrificial  horse  "  V 


chapter  40 

The  king's  sons  search  for  the  horse  ;  they  accuse  Shri  Kapila 
of  stealing  it  and  are  reduced  to  ashes 

"  The  grandsire  Shri  Brahma,  hearing  the  words  of  the  gods 
regarding  the  sons  of  Ring  Sagara,  who  were  already  doomed, 
said: — 

"  *  O  Devas,  this  whole  world  belongs  to  the  glorious  Vasu- 
deva2  and  he,  in  the  form  of  the  Sage  Kapila,  supports  it. 
These  princes  will  fall  victims  to  the  wrath  of  holy  Kapila ; 
the  earth  is  eternal  and  cannot  be  destroyed.'  The  gods, 
hearing  these  words,  returned  to  their  own  regions,  full  of  joy. 

"  Meanwhile,  the  uproar  caused  by  the  sons  of  Sagara  digging 
the  earth  resembled  the  crash  of  thunder. 

"  Having  encompassed  the  whole  world,  they  returned  to 
their  father  and  said :  '  We  have  traversed  the  whole  world 
and  have  slain  gods,  demons  and  snakes,  but  we  have  found 
no  trace  of  the  sacrificial  horse  nor  of  the  thief.  O  Father, 
may  prosperity  attend  thee,  be  pleased  to  reflect  on  the  matter 
and  give  us  further  instructions.' 

"  The  great  monarch  replied  in  anger :  *  Go,  dig  the  earth 
once  more,  capture  the  horse,  accomplish  your  purpose,  then 
return.'

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  In  accordance  with  the  command  of  their  royal  sire,  the 
princes  once  more  renewed  their  tunnelling  and  came  upon 
the  monstrous  form  of  a  great  elephant  which  resembled  a 
mountain. 

"  O  Prince  of  Raghu,  the  whole  earth  and  the  mountains 
of  that  quarter  are  supported  by  that  elephant  Vimpaksha,  and 
whenever,  from  fatigue,  he  moves  his  feet  to  ease  himself, 
the  whole  world  trembles  and  quakes. 

"  The  princes  bowed  down  to  him  and  circumambulated  him. 
They  then  continued  digging  deeper  and  deeper,  first  to  the 
east,  then  to  the  west.  To  the  south  they  saw  the  second 
great  elephant  whose  name  was  Mahapadma.  They  beheld  him 
supporting  that  quarter  of  the  earth  and  were  astonished ; 
they  offered  him  salutations. 

"  O  Prince,  the  sons  of  King  Sagara  next  dug  the  northern 
quarter  of  the  earth  and  saw  there  a  white  elephant  which 
resembled  a  heap  of  snow.  His  name  was  Hima-Pandara  and 
his  form  was  gigantic;  they  worshipped  him  as  he  stood 
supporting  that  quarter  of  the  earth. 

"  Then  with  furious  zeal,  those  mighty  and  valiant  sons  of 
Sagara  dug  the  earth  and  proceeded  to  that  renowned  quarter 
where  they  saw  Kapila  the  eternal  Lord  Vasudeva  and  the  horse 
grazing  near  him. 

"  O  Rama,  they  were  glad,  thinking  that  it  was  Shri  Kapila 
who  had  stolen  the  horse.  Full  of  wrath,  seizing  ploughs,  trees, 
rocks  and  stones,  they  ran  towards  him,  crying :  *  Thou  art 
the  stealer  of  the  sacrificial  horse,  thou  art  the  thief.  O  Wicked 
One,  we,  the  sons  of  King  Sagara,  have  found  thee.' 

"  O  Rama,  Shri  Kapila,  hearing  these  words,  filled  with  rage, 
uttered  the  sound  '  H*m '  and  instantly  by  his  immeasurable 
power  all  the  sons  of  Sagara  were  reduced  to  ashes."

King  Sagara's  grandson,  Anshuman,  finds  the  horse  and  the 

ashes  of  his  uncles.    He  is  told  the  funeral  rites  must  be 

performed  with  the  waters  of  the  holy  river  Gunga 

"  O  Ramachakdra,  perceiving  that  a  long  period  had  elapsed 
since  the  departure  of  his  sons,  King  Sagara  spoke  to  his 
powerful  and  resplendent  grandson  Anshuman  : 

"  *  O  Child,  thou  art  valiant,  learned  and  illustrious  like  thine 
ancestors,  go  and  seek  thine  uncles  and  the  stealer  of  the  horse 
also.  The  interior  of  the  earth  is  inhabited  by  the  most  mighty 
beings,  arm  thyself  therefore  with  sword,  bow  and  arrows.  Pay 
reverence  to  those  worthy  to  be  worshipped  whom  thou  dost 
encounter  on  the  way  and  make  obeisance  to  them ;  slay  those 
who  obstruct  thy  purpose,  then  successful,  return  and  ensure 
the  completion  of  the  sacrifice.' 

"  Thus  instructed  by  his  grandfather,  Prince  Anshuman, 
arming  himself  with  sword,  bow  and  arrows,  speedily  departed. 
Honoured  on  the  way  by  devas,  danavas,  asuras  and  nagas, 
pisachas,  birds  and  serpents,  he  came  to  the  mighty  and 
resplendent  elephant  and  worshipped  him,  enquiring  as  to  his 
welfare.  The  elephant  said  in  reply :  f  O  Prince  Anshuman, 
thou  wilt  accomplish  thy  purpose  and  soon  return  to  the  capital.' 

"  The  prince  proceeded  further  and  enquired  in  the  same 
manner  of  each  of  the  other  great  elephants.  They  all  advised 
the  prince,  who  had  paid  due  respect  to  them,  to  proceed  further. 
As  instructed  by  them,  Anshuman  came  to  the  place  where 
the  heaped  ashes  of  his  uncles*  bodies  were  lying.  Overcome 
with  grief,  Anshuman  wept  to  see  that  death  had  overtaken 
them.  Afflicted  with  distress  and  pain,  he  suddenly  perceived 
the  sacrificial  horse  grazing  near  by.  Desirous  of  offering  the 
rite  of  water  for  his  departed  relatives,  he  looked  round  but 
could  find  no  water  anywhere.  Extending  his  gaze,  he  saw 
his  maternal  uncle,  the  holy  eagle,  who  addressed  the  prince 
as  follows : — 

" '  O  Lion  among  men,  grieve  not,  these  princes  have  met 
the  death  they  deserved.    They  have  been  consumed  to  ashes 
83

by  the  Mahatma  Kapila  of  unimaginable  glory.  O  Wise  One, 
it  is  not  meet  to  offer  the  usual  rites  for  them.  O  Great  One, 
perform  the  rites  with  the  water  of  the  holy  river  Gunga,  the 
Daughter  of  Himalaya.  When  the  waters  of  the  purifier  of 
the  world,  the  sacred  Gunga  flow  over  their  ashes,  the  ceremony 
will  be  crowned  with  success  and  the  sixty  thousand  princes 
will  be  received  into  heaven  \" 

The  illustrious  and  mighty  Prince  Anshuman  listened  to  the 
words  of  Shri  Garuda  and  speedily  returning  with  the  horse, 
approached  King  Sagara,  who  still  awaited  the  completion  of 
the  initiatory  rites ;  he  related  to  him  all  that  the  eagle  had 
said.  The  monarch  completed  the  sacrifice  and  returned  to 
his  capital  considering  the  means  whereby  he  might  cause  Shri 
Gunga  to  descend  to  earth ;  but  in  vain. 

King  Sagara,  unable  to  devise  any  way  to  accomplish  this 
matter,  having  ruled  for  thirty  thousand  years,  departed  hence.

Anshuman* s  son,  Dilipa,  fails  and  his  son  Bhagiratha  performs 
austerities  to  induce  the  holy  river  to  descend 

After  his  death,  the  ministers  installed  the  virtuous  Anshuman 
as  king.  O  Rama,  glorious  was  the  reign  of  King  Anshuman. 
He  was  succeeded  by  his  son,  the  world-renowned  Dilipa. 

King  Anshuman,  leaving  his  kingdom  to  Dilipa,  retired  to 
the  top  of  a  Himalayan  peak  and  began  to  perform  severe  yogic 
austerities.  Having  passed  thirty-two  thousand  years  in  this 
wise,  without  inducing  the  sacred  river  Gunga  to  descend  on 
earth,  he  gave  up  his  life. 

Acquainted  with  the  fate  of  his  great  uncles,  and  overcome 
with  grief,  the  mighty  sovereign  Dilipa  found  no  means  of 
bringing  the  sacred  stream  down  to  earth.  Consumed  with 
anxiety,  he  reflected  daily  on  how  he  should  accomplish  the 
descent  of  the  Gunga  and  perform  the  funeral  rites  for  the 
deliverance  of  the  souls  of  his  ancestors.    The  righteous  and 


BALA    KANDA 

illustrious  King  Dilipa,  constantly  engaged  in  these  reflections, 
was  then  blessed  with  the  birth  of  a  virtuous  son, 
Bhagiratha. 

The  renowned  monarch  Dilipa  observing  many  sacrifices, 
ruled  over  his  kingdom  for  thirty  thousand  years ;  his  thoughts 
were  ever  devoted  to  the  deliverance  of  the  souls  of  his  forbears 
until  stricken  with  disease,  he  was  claimed  by  death.  Having 
bequeathed  the  kingdom  to  his  son  Bhagiratha,  his  spirit 
ascended  to  the  region  of  Indra. 

O  Rama,  Bhagiratha  was  a  virtuous  and  royal  sage,  but  he 
had  no  heir  and  was  desirous  of  obtaining  a  son.  O  Raghava, 
he  entrusted  the  administration  of  his  kingdom  to  his  ministers 
and  proceeded  to  the  holy  place  named  Gokarna  where  he 
practised  yogic  penances  to  attract  the  descent  of  the  holy  Gunga. 
With  arms  uplifted  and  senses  controlled,  he  stood  in  the  midst 
of  five  fires  in  the  hottest  season,  partaking  of  food  once  a  month 
only,  and  continued  thus  for  a  thousand  years. 

O  Mighty  Prince,  after  a  thousand  years,  Shri  Brahma,  the 
Lord  and  Ruler  of  the  world,  was  pleased  with  Bhagiratha  and, 
accompanied  by  the  devas,  approached  the  high-souled  king 
and  said ; 

"  O  Bhagiratha,  thy  virtuous  yogic  practices  have  elicited  our 
admiration  ;  ask  for  a  boon,  O  Fortunate  One." 

The  highly  resplendent  Bhagiratha,  with  joined  palms 
submissively  addressed  Shri  Brahma,  saying :  "  O  Blessed  Lord, 
if  thou  art  pleased  to  confer  the  fruits  of  mine  austerities  on  me 
and  grant  me  a  boon,  then  allow  me  to  deliver  the  souls  of 
the  sons  of  King  Sagara  by  offering  them  water  at  their  funeral 
rites,  from  the  sacred  stream.  O  Lord,  do  thou  also  grant  as 
a  further  boon  that  the  Dynasty  of  Ikshwaku  may  be  preserved 
and  I  may  have  an  heir." 

The  Grandsire  of  the  whole  world  listened  to  the  prayer  of 
the  Maharajah  Bhagiratha  and  answered  him  in  gentle  and 
pleasing  accents : — 

"  0  Mighty  King  Bhagiratha,  thou  hast  asked  a  great  boon, 

may  success  attend  thee  !    Let  thy  desire  for  a  son  be  fulfilled. 

0  King,  when  the  Gunga,  the  eldest  daughter  of  Himalaya  falls 

on  the  earth  with  overwhelming  power,  the  earth  will  not  be

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

able  to  sustain  her ;  none  but  the  Lord  Shiva  can  accomplish 
this." 

Having  uttered  these  words  to  King  Bhagiratha  and  having 
spoken  to  Shri  Gunga  also,  Shri  Brahma  returned  with  the  gods 
to  his  own  region. 


chapter   43 

Lord  Shiva  lets  loose  the  sacred  river  which  follows 
King  Bhagiratka's  celestial  chariot 

Shri  Brahma  having  departed,  the  King  Bhagiratha,  standing 
on  the  tip  of  one  toe,  adored  Shri  Shiva  for  a  full  year.  O 
Mighty  One,  with  arms  uplifted,  living  on  air,  unsupported, 
fixed  like  a  pillar,  day  and  night  King  Bhagiratha  offered  his 
adorations  to  the  Lord. 

A  full  year  having  passed,  the  Lord  of  Uma,  Shri  Mahadeva, 
who  is  adored  by  the  whole  world,  spoke  to  King  Bhagiratha 
as  follows :  "  O  Great  One,  I  am  pleased  with  thee,  I  will 
accomplish  what  thou  desirest,  I  will  receive  the  descent  of 
Gunga  on  my  head." 

Then  the  holy  Gunga,  the  eldest  daughter  of  Himalaya,  the 
object  of  reverence  to  the  whole  world,  assuming  the  form  of 
a  mighty  river,  descended  with  torrential  force  on  to  the  head 
of  Shiva.  The  goddess  reflected  within  herself  that  she  would 
bear  down  the  Lord  Mahadeva  to  the  antipodes.  Shri  Shiva, 
reading  her  thoughts,  grew  angry  and  determined  to  detain  the 
mighty  stream  in  his  hair.  Resembling  the  majestic  Himalayas, 
the  locks  of  Shri  Shiva  held  the  falling  Gunga  fast  and  the 
sacred  river  remained  imprisoned  there.  For  innumerable  years 
the  Gunga  wandered  round  and  round  in  the  locks  of  Shri 
Mahadeva  and  could  not  find  an  egress. 

O  Rama,  when  Shri  Bhagiratha  did  not  see  the  holy  stream 
descending  to  earth,  he  again  began  his  penance  in  order  to 
propitiate  the  Lord  of  the  world. 

Then  Shri  Shiva  let  loose  the  Gunga  in  the  Brindusara  lake 
86 


BALA    KANDA 

and  as  it  fell  it  divided  itself  into  seven  streams.  The  three 
branches  conferring  prosperity,  Hladini,  Pavani  and  Halini, 
flowed  towards  the  east  from  the  head  of  holy  Shiva. 

Then  the  sacred  Gunga  of  pure  and  delightful  water  was 
divided  into  three  further  branches,  Suchakshu,  Sita  and 
Sindhav>  all  flowing  towards  the  west.  The  seventh  of  these 
streams  followed  the  chariot  of  the  Maharajah  Bhagiratha. 

The  royal  sage,  riding  in  a  beautiful  chariot,  went  forward 
and  the  sacred  river  Gunga  followed  him. 

Thus  did  the  holy  river  descend  from  heaven  on  to  the 
forehead  of  Shri  Mahadeva  and  from  thence  came  to  the  surface 
of  the  earth. 

The  fall  of  the  sacred  stream  created  a  mighty  reverberation, 
her  waters  flowing  through  beautiful  ways.  Riding  their  aerial 
chariots  as  large  as  cities,  containing  elephants  and  horses,  the 
gods,  sages,  celestial  musicians,  yakshas  and  siddhas  in  great 
numbers,  came  to  witness  the  holy  Ganges  falling  from  heaven 
to  earth.  In  their  aerial  chariots  named  Pariplava,  the  gods 
came  to  see  this  wonderful  event  of  the  holy  river  flowing  on 
the  earth,  and  as  they  descended  from  the  skies,  the  splendour 
of  their  celestial  ornaments  irradiated  the  cloudless  canopy  of 
heaven  as  if  a  thousand  suns  had  risen  there. 

The  mercurial  fishes  and  aquatic  creatures  leaping  from  the 
stream  thrown  up  by  the  force  of  the  current,  shone  like  lightning 
in  the  sky,  whilst  the  foam  and  spray  scattered  on  all  sides 
resembled  flocks  of  swans  in  flight  or  clouds  in  winter. 

The  waters  of  the  holy  Gunga  sometimes  rose  high  in  the  air, 
sometimes  flowed  tortuously,  sometimes  broadened  out,  some- 
times dashed  against  the  rocks  and  sometimes  spouted  upwards 
afterwards  falling  to  the  ground ;  that  pure  water  capable  of 
removing  sin  looked  delightful  flowing  on  the  surface  of  the  earth. 

Then  the  celestial  sages  and  heavenly  musicians  and  the 
denizens  of  the  earth,  reverently  touched  that  sacred  stream 
falling  from  the  locks  of  Shiva. 

Those  beings,  who  through  a  curse,  had  fallen  from  the 
heavenly  regions  and  been  made  to  dwell  on  earth,  were  cleansed 
of  their  transgressions  by  bathing  in  the  holy  Gunga.  Purified 
and  freed  from  their  sins,  those  resplendent  beings  returned  to 
the  heavenly  regions,  passing  through  the  sky. 
87 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Wherever  the  sacred  Ganges  flowed,  people  were  cleansed 
of  their  sins  by  bathing  in  its  waters. 

King  Bhagiratha,  riding  a  celestial  chariot,  drove  on  and 
Shri  Gunga  followed  after  him. 

O  Rama,  the  gods,  the  sages,  rakshasas,  asuras,  yakshas, 
the  chief  serpents  and  nymphs  following  King  Bhagiratha, 
together  with  the  aquatic  beings  and  swans,  attended  the 
sacred  river.  Whichever  course  King  Bhagiratha  took,  that 
mighty  river  Gunga,  the  Destroyer  of  all  sin,  followed.  Flowing 
on  and  on,  Shri  Gunga  arrived  where  the  Sage  Jahnu,  worker 
of  miracles,  was  performing  a  sacrifice.  Then  the  sacred 
river  swept  over  the  sacrificial  pavilion  and  all  it  contained. 
The  Rishi  Jahnu  perceiving  the  pride  of  Gungaji,  grew  angry 
and  drank  up  the  whole  of  the  water  of  that  river,  verily  a  great 
miracle! 

The  devas,  gandharvas  and  sages  were  astonished  and  began 
to  worship  that  Mahatma  Jahnu,  saying,  "  From  to-day  the 
holy  river  shall  be  called  thy  daughter  ".  The  mighty  Jahnu 
being  pleased,  let  loose  the  river  through  his  ears.  From  thence 
Shri  Gunga  is  called  Jahnavi  (the  daughter  of  Jahnu).  Thereafter 
she  once  again  flowed  behind  the  chariot  of  King  Bhagiratha. 
Finally,  the  holy  Gunga  reached  the  sea  and  entered  the  lower 
regions  to  fulfil  the  purpose  of  the  king. 

The  royal  Sage  Bhagiratha  attended  by  the  sacred  river, 
gazed  with  grief  on  the  ashes  of  his  ancestors.  O  Prince  of 
the  House  of  Raghu,  as  soon  as  the  holy  stream  touched  the 
ashes,  the  sons  of  King  Sagara  were  resuscitated,  freed  from  sin, 
and  attained  the  celestial  region. 


chapter   44 

King  Bhagiratha  completes  the  funeral  rites  for  his  ancestors 

When  the  king  attended  by  the  holy  Gunga,  reached  the 
seashore,  he  entered  the  subterranean  region  where  the  sons 
of  King  Sagara  had  been  burnt  to  ashes. 


BALA    KANDA 

"  O  Rama,  as  the  holy  water  flowed  over  the  ashes,  Shri 
Brahma  the  Lord  of  all  the  worlds,  addressed  King  Bhagiratha 
as  follows :  '  O  Great  King,  thou  hast  redeemed  the  sixty 
thousand  sons  of  King  Sagara,  who  now  dwell  in  the  heavenly 
region.  O  King,  as  long  as  the  waters  of  the  sea  continue 
on  earth,  so  long  shall  the  sons  of  King  Sagara  in  celestial  form 
enjoy  heaven.  Henceforth,  O  Great  Sovereign,  Shri  Gunga 
shall  be  thy  eldest  daughter  and  be  known  by  thy  name 
throughout  the  earth.  This  sacred  river  shall  be  named  Shri 
Gunga,  Tripathaga1  and  Bhagirathi. 

" '  O  King,  perform  the  funeral  rites  of  thine  ancestors  and 
fulfil  thy  prescribed  duty.  The  mighty  King  Sagara  was  not 
able  to  accomplish  this  purpose  and  King  Anshuman  of  limitless 
prowess  also  failed  to  obtain  the  fulfilment  of  his  devout  desire. 
Thy  father  Dilipa,  equal  to  ourselves  in  merit  and  a  warrior 
fully  established  in  the  duties  of  his  caste,  that  illustrious  DUipa 
besought  the  holy  Gunga  to  descend  to  earth  in  vain.  This 
great  design  has  been  accomplished  by  thee  alone.  Thou  hast 
acquired  undying  renown  throughout  the  world. 

"  '  By  achieving  this,  thou  art  possessed  of  the  highest  dharma. 
O  Great  Sovereign,  now  do  thou  bathe  in  the  holy  stream  also. 
O  Lion  among  men,  purify  thyself  and  acquire  merit,  then 
perform  the  funeral  rites  of  thine  ancestors.  O  King,  may 
prosperity  attend  thee,  return  to  thy  capital,  I  shall  now  ascend 
to  my  own  abode.* 

"  The  mighty  and  illustrious  Brahma  then  ascended  to  heaven 
and  the  royal  Sage  Bhagiratha,  having  performed  the  obsequies 
of  the  sons  of  King  Sagara,  with  the  water  of  the  sacred  Ganges, 
returned  to  his  capital. 

"  Enjoying  every  felicity,  King  Bhagiratha  began  to  govern 
once  more  and  his  people  rejoiced  that  he  had  again  assumed 
rulership.  All  were  freed  from  suffering  and  anxiety  and  they 
increased  in  wealth  and  prosperity. 

"  O  Rama,  I  have  narrated  the  story  of  the  descent  of  Shri 
Gunga  fully  to  thee.  May  prosperity  attend  thee  1  Dusk  has 
fallen  and  the  hour  of  the  evening  prayer  has  come.  This  story

story,  shall  obtain  all  he  desires,  his  sins  will  be  remitted

chapter   45 

Vishwamitra  begins  to  relate  the  story  of  the  city  of 
Vishala  and  the  churning  of  the  ocean,  which  leads 
to  the  combat  between  the  devas  and  the  dotty  as 

Shri  Ramachandra  and  Shri  Lakshmana  were  filled  with 
astonishment  on  hearing  the  words  of  Shri  Vishwamitra,  and 
said  to  him :  "  O  Holy  Sage,  marvellous  indeed  is  the  history 
of  King  Sagara  and  the  descent  of  the  Ganges,  which  thou  hast 
related  to  us." 

The  night  drew  on  as  they  had  been  listening  to  the  story, 
and  Shri  Rama  and  Lakshmana  passed  the  remaining  hours 
meditating  on  the  matter. 

The  clear  day  dawned  and  Shri  Rama,  having  performed 
his  daily  devotions,  said  to  Shri  Vishwamitra :  "  The  night 
has  passed  in  listening  to  this  divine  narrative,  it  has  slipped 
away,  as  if  it  were  a  moment.  Now  let  us  cross  the  sacred 
and  merit-giving  stream  reflecting  on  its  marvellous  origin. 
Knowing  thee  to  have  come,  the  other  sages  have  sent  a  boat 
in  preparation  for  crossing  the  holy  river." 

Shri  Vishwamitra  summoned  the  ferryman  and  with  the 
princes  and  sages  all  were  conveyed  to  the  other  side.  They 
rested  awhile  on  the  opposite  bank  and  entertained  the  sages 
in  their  company.  In  the  distance,  they  saw  the  city  named 
Vishala  and  soon  the  great  Rishi  Vishwamitra  with  the  princes 
reached  that  place  of  beauty,  which  resembled  one  of  Indra's 
cities. 

Then  Rama,  full  of  wisdom,  approached  the  holy  sage  and 
90 


BALA    KANDA 

humbly  made  enquiry  concerning  the  city.  He  said:  "O 
Great  Sage,  what  royal  and  illustrious  house  rules  here  ?  I 
desire  to  hear." 

At  these  words  of  Rama,  the  holy  sage  began  to  relate  the 
story  of  the  city  as  follows : — 

"  O  Rama,  attend !  I  will  tell  thee  the  story  of  this  city, 
which  I  heard  from  Indra. 

*'  In  the  golden  age  (Satya  Yuga)  Diti1  gave  birth  to  a  powerful 
son  Daitya,  an  asura,  and  Aditi1  gave  birth  to  the  highly 
fortunate  and  exceedingly  righteous  son  Devata,  a  celestial 
being.  These  two  sagacious  beings  sought  to  become  immortal, 
incorruptible  and  free  from  disease,  old  age  and  other  ills. 
After  reflecting  on  this  matter,  they  resolved  to  churn  Kshiroda 
(the  ocean  of  milk)  and  obtain  from  it  the  water  of  immortality. 
Using  the  mighty  snake  Vasuki  as  a  rope  and  the  Mandara 
mountain  as  the  churn,  they  began  to  churn  the  ocean.  When 
they  had  done  so  for  a  thousand  years,  the  snake  Vasuki  bit 
the  rocks  with  its  teeth  and  threw  up  venom.  From  this  was 
produced  the  great  poison  which  began  to  consume  men,  gods, 
demons  and  the  whole  world. 

"  The  gods  took  refuge  with  the  Lord  Shiva  and  worshipped 
him  crying  *  Protect  us,  protect  us  \  Attracted  by  the  mournful 
cry  of  the  gods,  Shri  Mahadeva  and  Shri  Hari3  appeared  there 
with  conch  and  disc. 

"  Shri  Vishnu3  smilingly  addressed  the  bearer  of  the  trident, 
Shri  Mahadeva,  and  said :  '  O  Lord,  thou  art  the  chief  of  the 
gods  and  should'st,  therefore,  accept  whatever  is  first  produced 
by  the  churning  of  the  ocean.  Receive  the  poison  as  thy  gift, 
the  first  tribute/ 

"Having  spoken  thus,  Shri  Vishnu  disappeared,  and  the 
Blessed  Lord  Shiva,  moved  by  the  distress  of  the  gods  and 
the  words  of  Shri  Vishnu,  drank  the  dreadful  poison,  as  if  it 
were  nectar,  and  returned  to  Kailasha. 

"  O  Prince  of  Raghu,  the  devas  and  the  daityas  began  churning 
once  more,  but  the  churning  staff  began  to  sink.  Then  the 
devas  and  gandharvas  praised  the  Lord  Vishnu,  saying :   *  O 

1  Diti — a  goddess,  mother  of  the  titans,  daityas. 

*  Aditi — a  goddess,  denoting  "  infinity  ",  mother  of  the  gods,  adityas.

Blessed  Lord,  Thou  art  the  Master  of  all  beings,  thou  art  the 
asylum  of  the  gods — protect  us  all,  O  Great  Lord,  and  support 
the  sinking  Mandara  mountain/ 

"  Shri  Vishnu,  assuming  the  form  of  a  tortoise,  entered  the 
ocean  and  supported  the  mountain  on  his  back.  Taking  hold 
of  the  peak  in  his  hand,  the  blessed  Vishnu  churned  the  ocean, 
standing  between  the  devas  and  the  asuras. 

"After  a  thousand  years,  Shri  Dhanwantari,1  the  teacher  of 
the  Ayur  Veda  appeared,  holding  a  staff  and  loshta  in  his  hands ; 
thereafter  many  nymphs  emerged.  O  Raghava,  they  were  called 
apsaras,  *  ap '  meaning  water  and  '  yara '  to  '  emerge  from ' ; 
on  this  account  these  beautiful  damsels  were  named  *  apsaras.' 
O  Rama,  they  numbered  six  hundred  million  and  their  female 
attendants  were  innumerable.  None  were  received  either  by 
the  devas  or  the  daityas,  hence  they  remained  without  a  lord. 

°  Then,  O  Prince,  Varuni,8  the  daughter  of  the  god  Varuna2 
was  born.  The  sons  of  Aditi  did  not  accept  her,  but  the  asuras 
gladly  did  so.  Those  who  rejected  her  were  called  suras3 
(devas)  and  those  who  received  her  became  merry  and  were 
called  asuras. 

"  O  Raghava,  then  the  celestial  horse  Uchchaihshravas  and 
the  jewel  Kaustubha  also  rose  out  of  the  sea,  and  they  were 
succeeded  by  the  water  of  immortality. 

"  O  Rama,  the  devas  fought  with  the  danavas*  for  possession 
of  the  nectar  and  the  daityas  allied  themselves  with  the  asuras 
in  this  struggle ;  terrible  indeed  was  this  combat. 

"Aftei  many  had  lost  their  lives  in  the  fight,  Shri  Vishnu 
assumed  the  form  of  Mohini,  a  charming  woman  the  product 
of  Maya5  and  stole  the  nectar  from  the  combatants. 

"  Those  who  opposed  the  imperishable  Vishnu  were  destroyed 
by  him.  In  this  conflict  the  gods  slew  countless  daityas.6 
Indra,  after  slaying  the  asuras,  became  the  king  of  the  devas 
and  with  the  help  of  the  sages  began  to  rule  with  joy."

Diti  undergoes  severe  austerities  for  the  birth  of  a  son 

"  O  Rama,  learning  that  her  children  had  been  slain,  Diti 
was  much  afflicted  and  approached  her  husband  Kasyapa1 
with  the  words :  '  O  Lord,  by  thy  powerful  sons,  am  I 
bereft  of  my  children.  I  desire  a  son  who  will  be  able  to 
destroy  India,  though  to  this  end  I  must  undergo  great 
penance.  Such  austerities  I  will  perform,  if  thou  wilt  grant 
me  a  son  that  is  mighty,  valorous,  strong-willed  and  firm  of 
purpose.* 

"  The  holy  sage  answered  the  afflicted  Diti  saying :  '  Be  it 
so  !  Remain  chaste  for  a  thousand  years,  thou  shalt  then  bear 
a  son  capable  of  destroying  Indra.  By  my  grace,  thy  child 
shall  be  the  ruler  of  the  three  worlds.' 

"  Thus  did  the  sage  console  Did,  and  blessing  her,  departed 
to  practise  penance.  Diti  retired  contentedly  to  the  forest 
of  Kushaplava  and  began  to  undergo  severe  austerities. 

"  Indra  then,  coming  there,  paid  reverence  to  her  and  began 
to  serve  her  with  humility,  supplying  her  with  fire,  kusha  grass3 
and  other  necessities,  massaging  her  body  when  she  became 
weak  from  the  severity  of  ascetic  practices.  O  Rama,  Indra 
served  Diti  for  a  thousand  years  less  ten  days. 

"  Then  Diti  joyfully  addressed  Indra  saying :  *  O  Indra,  thy 
father  has  promised  to  grant  me  a  son  after  a  thousand  years 
penance.  Thou  shalt  soon  behold  thy  brother,  whom  I  desire 
shall  overcome  thee.  With  him  thou  shalt  share  the  three 
worlds  and  be  happy,  have  no  anxiety.' 

"  By  this  time  the  afternoon  had  come.  Diti  overcome  with 
sleep,  placing  her  feet  where  her  head  had  lain,  carelessly 
assumed  an  impure  posture. 

"  Indra  rejoiced  and  laughed  aloud.  Entering  her  body,  he 
cut  the  foetus  into  seven  pieces  with  his  great  mace.  Dili's 
slumber  was  interrupted  by  the  cry  of  the  child  in  her  womb.

Indra  said  to  it  *  Do  not  weep  *,  *  Do  not  weep  ',  and  again 
divided  the  child  with  his  mace,  despite  Diti*s  cries,  '  Do  not 
destroy  it,  do  not  destroy  it '. 

"  Then  Indra  paused  in  his  murderous  assault  and  with 
extreme  humility  addressed  Diti  saying  *  O  Diti,  thou  wast 
impure  through  sleeping  with  thy  feet  towards  the  head  of  the 
couch,  thou  did'st  thus  occupy  an  improper  posture.  I  have, 
therefore,  severed  thine  unborn  child  into  seven  parts,  since  he 
was  to  be  the  cause  of  my  destruction.    O  Devi,  pardon  me  V*

greatly  perturbed  and  said  to  Indra : — 

"Through  my  fault  has  this  come  to  pass ;  O  Indra,  thou  art 
in  no  wise  guilty.  This  child  being  divided,  for  thy  good  and 
mine  own,  I  declare  that  these  seven  shall  become  the  protectors 
of  the  forty-nine  winds.  These  seven  sons  of  divine  appearance 
shall  be  known  as  the  Bala-kanda  winds.  Let  one  wander  about 
in  the  region  of  Brahma,  another  in  the  region  of  Indra,  and 
the  third  in  space.  Let  the  remaining  four  winds  go  anywhere 
under  thy  instructions ;  may  they  all  be  known  by  the  name 
of  Maruts,  conferred  on  them  by  thee." 

With  joined  palms,  the  thousand-eyed  god  Indra  said  in  reply 
to  Diti :  "  O  Devi,  it  will  assuredly  come  to  pass  as  thou 
desireth.  Thy  sons  shall  wander  about  in  the  form  of  devas 
in  the  Tapovana  forest." 

Thus  reconciled  and  fully  satisfied  the  mother  and  son 
ascended  to  heaven. 

Thus  have  I  heard,  O  Rama  !    This  is  that  Tapovana  forest 
in  which  Indra  formerly  served  his  mother  Diti.     O   Lion 
among  Men,  here  a  great  city  was  founded  by  the  righteous 
Prince  Vishala,  the  son  of  King  Ikswaku  and  Alambusa.

BALA    KANDA 

O  Rama*  the  mighty  son  of  Vishala  was  named  Hemachandra, 
and  his  son  was  the  renowned  Suchandra.  O  Rama,  the  son 
of  Suchandra  was  Dhumrashwa  and  his  son  was  Srinjaya. 
The  glorious  Sahadeva  was  the  son  of  Srinjaya  and  the  son 
of  Sahadeva  was  the  highly  virtuous  Krishashwa. 

The  son  of  Krishashwa  was  Somadatta  and  his  son  was 
Kakustha.  The  most  illustrious  and  invincible  of  warriors 
King  Pramati  the  son  of  Kakustha,  is  the  present  ruler  of 
Vishala. 

By  the  grace  of  King  Ikswaku  all  the  rulers  of  Vishala  are 
long  lived,  virtuous  and  mighty. 

O  Rama,  let  us  pass  the  night  here,  and  to-morrow  we  will 
wait  upon  King  Janaka. 

When  the  powerful  King  Pramati  heard  of  Shri  Vishwamitra's 
arrival  in  his  kingdom,  he  went  with  his  spiritual  preceptor 
and  relatives  to  welcome  him. 

With  joined  palms,  they  offered  him  due  worship  and  enquired 
as  to  his  welfare.  The  king  said :  "  O  Muni,  to-day  I  am 
indeed  fortunate  that  thou  hast  been  gracious  enough  to  visit 
my  kingdom.    None  is  more  blessed  than  I." 


CHAPTER    48 

They  come  to  Gautama's  hermitage  and  Vishwamitra 
relates  its  story 

King  Pramati  having  enquired  as  to  the  well-being  of  Shri 
Vishwamitra,  said : — 

"  O  Holy  Sage,  may  the  Lord  protect  those  two  youths ; 
be  gracious  enough  to  tell  me  who  they  may  be.  These  princes, 
equal  to  the  gods  in  power,  walking  with  the  gait  of  an  elephant, 
fearless  as  lions  or  bulls  in  combat,  whose  eyes  resemble  lotuses, 
who  are  armed  with  swords,  bows  and  quivers,  who  rival 
the  heavenly  Aswins1  in  beauty  and  who,  in  the  flower  of  their 

1  Aswini — celestial  horsemen,  twin  sons  of  Surya,  the  sun,  precursors  of  the 
dawn.

youth,  appear  like  gods,  visiting  the  earth.  Why  are  they 
travelling  on  foot  ?  Whose  sons  are  they  ?  Why  are  they 
come  ?  Enhancing  the  earth  as  the  sun  and  moon  illumine 
the  sky ;  their  manner  of  address  and  bearing  showing  them 
to  be  kinsmen,  why  are  these  two  heroes  of  high  descent, 
bearing  mighty  weapons,  found  on  this  hard  path?  I  long 
to  hear.*' 

Shri  Vishwamitra  related  to  the  king  the  whole  story  of  the 
visit  to  the  Siddha  Ashrama  and  the  slaying  of  the  asuras. 

The  king  was  highly  gratified  to  meet  the  princes,  and 
perceiving  them  to  be  virtuous,  entertained  them  with  the 
greatest  respect.  Shri  Ramachandra  and  Lakshmana  having 
received  hospitality  from  King  Pramati,  passed  the  night 
there.  The  following  day  they  left  for  Mithilapuri,  the  capital 
of  King  Janafca. 

When  they  beheld  the  city  at  a  distance,  they  cried  out : 
"  How  beautiful,  how  beautiful  it  is  !  "  Thereafter,  finding  a 
charming  hermitage  which  was  uninhabited,  Rama  enquired  of 
the  Rishi  Vishwamitra  as  follows :  "  O  Sage,  how  can  it  be 
that  this  beautiful  hermitage  is  unfrequented  ?  O  Lord,  tell  us 
whose  has  been  this  hermitage  ?  " 

Shri  Vishwamitra,  chief  among  the  eloquent,  answered  Rama, 
saying :  "  O  Prince,  hear  the  true  story  of  this  hermitage,  I 
will  relate  to  thee  who  was  its  author  and  how  he  cursed  it 
in  anger. 

"  O  Rama,  this  place,  a  source  of  wonder  even  to  the  gods, 
belonged  to  the  Rishi  Gautama  and  resembled  the  abode  of 
the  celestials.  Here  with  Ahalya,  the  sage  practised  Yoga  for 
thousands  of  years. 

"  O  Rama,  one  day,  the  sage  having  gone  to  a  distant  place, 
Indra,  finding  Ahalya  alone,  assumed  his  form,  and  said  to  her : 
*  O  Fair  One,  I  am  overcome  by  desire,  let  us  carry  out  our 
conjugal  duty.* 

"  O  Raghava,  though  Ahalya  recognized  Indra  disguised  as 
her  lord,  yet  she  acceded  to  his  request.  Then  Ahalya  addressed 
Indra  saying :  *  O  Indra,  I  am  highly  gratified,  now  depart 
quickly,  unobserved.  O  Chief  of  the  gods,  preserve  me  and 
thyself  from  Gautama.' 

"  Indra  laughed  and  answered :  *  O  Thou  of  beautiful  waist, 
96 


BALA    KANDA 

to-day  I  rejoice,  I  will  now  depart  for  my  own  region.'  On  this, 
he  sought  to  leave  the  hut  of  Ahalya. 

"  O  Rama,  at  that  instant  he  observed  the  Rishi  Gautama 
entering  the  hut  and  he  became  agitated  and  anxious.  Seeing 
the  holy  sage  unconquered  by  devas  or  danavas,  endowed  with 
the  power  of  Yoga,  drenched  with  holy  water,  shining  like  fire, 
holding  the  sacred  fuel  and  kusha  grass  in  his  hands,  Indra 
was  terrified  and  grew  pale. 

"  Shri  Gautama  perceiving  Indra  in  his  own  guise  and 
judging  by  his  guilty  looks  that  he  was  leaving  his  spouse 
having  committed  sin  with  her,  cursed  him  saying : — 

"  •  O  Wicked  Wretch,  assuming  my  form,  thou  hast  committed 
this  sinful  act.  Be  thou  impotent.'  Cursed  by  the  Rishi  Gautama, 
Indra  was  instantly  deprived  of  bis  manhood.  Then  the  Sage 
Gautama  cursed  Ahalya  also  saying :  *  Thou  shalt  remain 
immovable  in  this  place  for  thousands  of  years,  thy  food  the 
wind  alone.  Thou  shalt  be  as  dust,  invisible  to  all  creatures. 
When  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha  visits  this  forest,  then  shalt 
thou  be  cleansed  from  thy  sin.  Having  served  him,  O  Deluded 
One  without  desire  for  personal  gain,  thou  shalt  be  restored 
to  me  in  thy  present  body/ 

"  Thus  did  the  illustrious  Gautama  curse  the  wicked  Ahalya 
and,  abandoning  the  hermitage,  began  his  yogic  penances,  on 
the  beautiful  peak  of  Himalaya,  inhabited  by  siddhas." 


chapter   49 

Shri  Rama  liberates  Ahalya  from  Gautama's  curse 

and  departs  for  Mithila 

Deprived  of  his  virility,  Indra  grew  melancholy,  and  addressing 
Agni  and  the  other  gods,  said :  "  By  obstructing  the  ascetic 
practices  of  the  Mahatma  Gautama,  who  sought  to  usurp  my 
power,  I  have  verily  served  the  purpose  of  the  gods.  Evoking 
his  wrath,  by  causing  him  to  curse  me  and  denounce  Ahalya, 
97 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

I  have  robbed  the  rishi  of  his  spiritual  power,  therefore,  O  Devas, 
O  Divine  Beings,  help  me  now  to  recover  my  manhood." 

Then  the  gods  with  Agni  at  their  head,  approached  the 
pittris,  kavyavahanas  and  other  beings  and  said  to  them :  "  Indra 
has  been  deprived  of  his  virility ;  this  ram  of  yours  is  in  full 
possession  of  its  powers,  allow  us  to  graft  the  testicles  of  the  ram 
on  to  Indra,  we  can  compensate  the  ram  in  this  wise — from 
to-day,  let  those  who  desire  to  propitiate  you,  offer  the  sacrifice 
of  a  castrated  ram  and  receive  the  reward  of  great  merit  at  your 
hands." 

The  pittris  did  as  requested  by  Agni  and  grafted  the  testicles 
of  the  ram  on  to  Indra.  From  that  time,  O  Rama,  they  have 
accepted  the  sacrifice  of  a  gelded  ram. 

This  event  proves  the  immeasurable  power  of  the  practices 
of  the  holy  sage.  Now  let  us  enter  his  hermitage.  O  Rama, 
do  thou  liberate  the  unfortunate  Ahalya,  so  that  she  may  once 
more  resume  her  nymph-like  form." 

Shri  Rama  accepted  the  command  and  entered  the  hermitage, 
preceded  by  the  Sage  Vishwamitra.  There  they  beheld  Ahalya, 
by  virtue  of  her  yogic  practices.  Unperceived  by  devas,  asuras 
or  men,  it  seemed  as  if  Brahma  had  created  her  with  his  own 
hands  as  a  great  mistress  of  occult  powers.  Resembling  the 
full  moon  veiled  in  mist  or  the  reflection  of  the  sun  in  water 
or  a  bright  fire  wreathed  in  smoke,  by  the  curse  of  the  Rishi 
Gautama  she  remained  invisible  and  thus  it  was  ordained  she 
should  remain  till  she  beheld  Shri  Ramachandra  and  till  that 
hour,  none  in  the  three  worlds  should  look  on  her. 

With  the  deepest  reverence  did  Shri  Rama  and  Lakshmana 
touch  the  feet  of  Ahalya  and  she,  remembering  the  words  of 
the  Rishi  Gautama  fell  down  in  devotion  before  them.  There- 
after, she  entertained  them  with  due  hospitality,  as  enjoined 
in  the  scriptures,  while  the  two  princes  acknowledged  the  honour 
paid  to  them.  At  this  moment  a  rain  of  flowers  fell  from  the  sky, 
scattered  by  the  gods ;  heavenly  musicians  sang  and  celestial 
nymphs  danced  whilst  all  rejoiced  and  paid  homage  to 
Ahalya. 

The  illustrious  Sage  Gautama  becoming  aware  of  the  matter 
through  his  divine  powers,  repaired  to  the  hermitage  and  rejoiced 
to  behold  Ahalya  restored  to  her  former  state.  Re-united,  they 
98 


BALA    KANDA 

both  worshipped  the  glorious  Rama  and  then  resumed  their 
spiritual  life  together. 

Shri  Rama,  having  accepted  the  homage  offered  to  him, 
departed  thence  for  Mithila. 


chapter   50 

They  are  welcomed  at  the  place  of  sacrifice  by  King  Janaka 

Preceded  by  Shri  Vishwamitra,  Shri  Rama  and  Lakshmana 
came  to  the  king's  place  of  sacrifice.  Beholding  the  sacrificial 
pavilion,  they  said  to  the  holy  sage  :  "  How  well  has  the  great 
Janaka  prepared  for  the  sacrifice !  O  August  Rishi,  thousands 
of  brahmins  learned  in  the  Vedas,  from  many  lands,  with 
hundreds  of  bullock  carts  transporting  their  possessions,  can  be 
seen  here.  O  Holy  Father,  let  us  choose  a  place  where  thou 
mayest  rest." 

The  Sage  thereupon  selected  a  place  which  was  secluded 
and  supplied  with  water. 

Hearing  of  the  arrival  of  Shri  Vishwamitra,  King  Janaka, 
accompanied  by  his  illustrious  priest,  Shri  Shatananda,  and 
many  others,  hastened  to  that  place  and  humbly  offered  obeisance 
to  the  holy  sage.  Then  the  king  placed  the  traditional  gifts 
of  water  sweetened  with  honey1  before  him  and  he,  accepting 
the  gifts,  enquired  as  to  the  king's  welfare  and  further  whether 
the  sacrifice  was  proceeding  without  hindrance ;  he  then  duly 
inquired  concerning  the  welfare  of  Shri  Shatananda  and  other 
holy  men  in  attendance  on  their  sovereign. 

The  king  received  all  with  a  cheerful  countenance  and  with 
joined  palms  said  to  Shri  Vishwamitra :  "  O  August  Lord, 
please  be  seated  with  the  other  great  sages."  Thus  requested, 
they  sat  down,  after  which  Janaka  with  his  family  priest, 
DKuimins  and  counsellors  occupied  their  places,  the  king  seated 
in  the  midst  of  his  ministers.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Having  attended  to  the  due  placing  of  his  guests,  the  illustrious 
sovereign  said :  "  O  Lord,  to-day,  by  the  grace  of  the  gods, 
all  the  preparations  for  the  sacrifice  have  been  carried  out,  now 
by  thine  advent  here  I  have  acquired  merit  equal  to  the  fruit 
of  my  sacrifice.  Blessed  am  I  that  thou  hast  honoured  the  place 
of  sacrifice  with  thy  presence.  O  Divine  Sage,  the  high  priests 
have  informed  me  that  the  sacrifice  will  be  completed  in  the 
course  of  twelve  days,  the  gods  will  then  come  to  take  their 
share ;  Thou,  O  Illustrious  Lord,  shalt  behold  them." 

Having  thus  addressed  the  sage,  the  king  again  earnestly 
enquired  of  him,  saying :  "  May  prosperity  attend  thee ! 
O  Sage,  who  are  these  two  illustrious  princes,  equalling  the  gods 
in  power,  whose  bearing  resembles  the  majesty  of  an  elephant, 
or  a  lion,  who  are  valiant  and  whose  eyes  are  like  lotuses,  who 
are  armed  with  swords,  bows  and  quivers  and  whose  beauty 
rivals  the  Aswini-Kumara,  who  are  youthful  and  appear  to 
have  descended  from  heaven  to  earth  like  the  gods  ?  Have 
they  come  here  on  foot  ?  Whose  sons  are  they  ?  They,  whose 
eyes  are  wide  set  and  who  are  armed  with  sacred  weapons, 
who  wear  their  hair  like  Karttikeya1  and  who  captivate  the  hearts 
of  men  by  their  magnanimous  and  virtuous  qualities  ?  Surely 
they  are  come  hither  to  exalt  our  hearts  and  add  to  the  fame 
of  our  dynasty  ?  Adorning  the  earth  as  the  sun  or  moon  adorn 
the  sky,  in  stature  and  bearing  resembling  each  other,  O  Great 
Sage,  whose  sons  are  they  ?    Please  tell  me  all !  " 

Hearing  the  words  of  King  Janaka,  Shri  Vishwamitra  said : 
*'  These  are  the  sons  of  King  Dasaratha." 

He  then  told  the  king  of  their  residence  in  the  Siddha-Asrama 
and  of  the  slaying  of  the  demons,  of  their  visit  to  Vishala  and 
the  rescue  of  Ahalya,  also  of  their  meeting  with  the  Sage 
Gautama.  Then  he  said :  "  Now  have  we  come  to  see  the 
great  bow." 

Having  related  all  this  to  the  king,  the  great  muni  became 
silent.

Gautama's  son,  Shatananda,  relates  more  of  the  story 
of  the  Sage  Vishwamitra 

Having  heard  the  words  of  the  wise  Vishwamitra,  Shri  Shat- 
ananda, the  eldest  son  of  the  Sage  Gautama,  resplendent  by 
virtue  of  his  practice  of  Yoga,  was  filled  with  wonder  and  delight 
and,  beholding  Shri  Rama  was  astonished. 

Seeing  the  two  princes  sitting  at  their  ease,  Shri  Shatananda 
said  to  the  Sage  Vishwamitra :  "  O  Holy  Sage,  was  my  mother, 
so  long  involved  in  the  practice  of  austerity,  shown  by  thee 
to  Shri  Ramachandra  ?  O  Illustrious  One,  did  my  mother  enter- 
tain these  two  heroes  worthy  of  adoration  with  fruits  and  those 
things  she  was  able  to  obtain  in  the  hermitage  ? 

"  O  Holy  Rishi,  didst  thou  relate  the  story  of  the  improper 
behaviour  of  Indra  to  my  mother  in  bygone  days,  to  Shri 
Ramachandra?  O  Holy  One,  by  virtue  of  the  advent  of 
Shri  Rama,  did  my  mother  obtain  my  father's  favour  once 
more  ?  O  Kaushika,  did  my  father  duly  honour  Shri  Rama- 
chandra and  is  this  Illustrious  One,  having  received  the  hospitality 
of  my  parents,  really  come  hither  ?  O  Holy  Sage,  please  tell 
me;  when  my  tranquil-minded  sire  entered  the  hermitage, 
was  he  honoured  by  Shri  Rama  ?  " 

Shri  Vishwamitra,  skilled  in  the  art  of  converse  and  acquainted 
with  the  laws  of  rhetoric,  answered  Shri  Shatananda  saying  : — 

"  O  Great  Muni,  I  did  that  which  should  be  done,  by  speaking 
that  which  was  proper  to  the  occasion,  and  patiently  listening 
to  that  which  was  spoken,  recollecting  my  duty.  As  Jamadagni, 
who  first  cursed  Renuka  and  was  then  reconciled  to  her,  so  has 
thy  father  shown  favour  to  thy  mother  and  received  her  again." 
Hearing  the  words  of  Shri  Vishwamitra,  the  great  Shatananda 
addressed  Shri  Ramachandra,  saying :  "  O  Great  One,  may 
thy  coming  be  the  source  of  prosperity  to  all.  It  is  fortunate 
indeed  that  thou  didst  visit  my  father's  hermitage  and  restore 
my  mother  to  her  former  state.  How  can  I  sufficiently  praise 
that  mighty  Sage  Shri  Vishwamitra,  reverenced  by  all  the 
sages.  O  Rama,  enlightened  are  his  actions ;  by  virtue  of  his

holy  practices  he  has  become  a  brahmarishi1  though  previously 
a  royal  sage.  Among  brahmarishis  he  is  unique,  he  is  known 
to  me  as  one  who  is  ever  concerned  with  the  good  of  all.  O 
Rama,  none  is  equal  to  thee  on  earth,  since  thou  art  protected 
by  so  great  a  sage  as  Vishwamitra.  Hear  while  I  relate  the  story 
of  the  great  Kaushika2  to  thee : — 

"  In  the  past,  this  holy  sage  was  a  virtuous  monarch,  versed 
in  all  branches  of  learning,  delighting  in  the  welfare  of  his 
subjects  and  the  destroyer  of  his  foes. 

"  Kusha,  the  righteous  and  powerful  king,  was  the  son  of 
Prajapati,  and  his  son  was  Gadhi,  and  the  great  and  illustrious 
Sage  Vishwamitra  is  the  son  of  Gadhi. 

"  On  ascending  the  throne,  King  Vishwamitra  ruled  the  earth 
for  many  thousands  of  years.  At  a  certain  time,  King  Vish- 
wamitra, assembling  his  army,  set  out  to  range  the  earth. 
O  Rama,  he  passed  through  many  cities  and  kingdoms  and 
crossed  innumerable  rivers,  mountains  and  forests,  visiting  many 
hermitages  till  he  came  to  the  one  belonging  to  Shri  Vasishtha. 
This  hermitage  was  thickly  planted  with  many-branched  trees 
with  dense  foliage  in  which  birds  of  every  kind  dwelt.  Many 
species  of  beasts  frequented  that  place,  and  the  siddhas  also 
came  there — devas,  gandharvas  and  other  celestial  beings  added 
to  the  peace  and  beauty  of  that  hermitage  by  their  presence. 
Beautiful  birds  flew  about  and  peaceful  deer  wandered  here 
and  there.    Many  learned  brahmins  also  dwelt  in  that  hermitage. 

"  Brahmin  sages  and  also  celestial  rishis  inhabited  that  place, 
so  that  it  shone  like  fire  by  virtue  of  their  presence.  This 
hermitage  sheltered  many  great  Vedic  scholars  equal  to  Brahma, 
some  living  only  on  air,  some  on  water,  some  on  dry  leaves. 
Other  sages  lived  on  fruit  and  roots,  and  there  were  in  addition 
thousands  of  brahmacharis  fully  self-subdued. 

"  Each  sage  observed  the  sacred  traditions,  performing  his 
morning  and  evening  devotions,  repeating  the  silent  prayer  (japa) 
offering  water  to  the  spirits  of  his  ancestors,  and  pouring  obla- 
tions into  the  sacrificial  fire.

How  King  Vishwamitra  visits  Skri  Vasishtha's  hermitage 

and  accepts  hospitality  provided  by  the  wish-fulfilling  cow,

Beholding  the  hermitage,  the  mighty  Vishwamitra  filled  with 
joy,  bowed  with  great  humility  to  Shri  Vasishtha  who  was 
engaged  in  the  telling  of  his  rosary. 

Shri  Vasishtha  welcomed  the  king  and  bade  him  be  seated, 
and  he  having  done  so  was  offered  the  fruits  and  roots  that 
grew  in  that  place. 

Honoured  by  the  holy  sage,  King  Vishwamitra  enquired  of 
him  if  all  were  well  with  the  fire  sacrifice,  his  spiritual  practices 
and  his  disciples.  Shri  Vasishtha  related  to  him  all  that 
concerned  his  welfare  and  the  welfare  of  those  in  the  hermitage, 
even  to  the  trees  themselves. 

Sitting  at  ease,  Shri  Vasishtha  said  to  King  Vishwamitra, 
eminent  among  yogis  and  a  son  of  Shri  Brahma  himself :  "  O 
King,  is  it  well  with  thee  in  all  ways  ?  Dost  thou  give  satisfaction 
to  thy  subjects  in  accordance  with  the  law  of  righteousness  and 
dost  thou  rule  and  protect  thy  people  according  to  the  spiritual 
law  ?  Is  thy  revenue  justly  received  and  increased  ?  Is  it 
judiciously  administered  and  distributed  to  those  who  are  eligible 
and  deserving?  Are  thy  servants  remunerated  at  the  proper 
season  ?  Do  thy  subjects  willingly  obey  thee  ?  O  Sovereign, 
hast  thou  subdued  thine  enemies  ?  O  Sinless  King,  is  it  well 
with  thine  army,  thy  treasury,  thy  friends,  thy  sons  and 
grandsons  ?  " 

In  reply  to  these  questions,  King  Vishwamitra  humbly 
answered :  "All  is  well,  my  Lord  I " 

Conversing  pleasantly  together  tor  a  long  time,  recounting 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  ancient  traditions  to  each  other,  they  thus  promoted  their 
mutual  delight, 

O  Prince  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  when  King  Vishwamitra 
paused,  Shri  Vasishtha  said  to  him  smilingly :  "  O  King, 
although  thou  hast  with  thee  a  large  retinue,  yet  it  is  my  desire 
to  offer  thee  hospitality,  together  with  thine  army.  Be  pleased 
to  accept  it.  Since  thou  art  a  distinguished  guest,  it  is  meet 
that  I  should  do  all  within  my  power  to  entertain  thee,  therefore, 
be  gracious  enough  to  receive  the  little  I  have  to  offer." 

King  Vishwamitra  answered :  "  O  Lord,  thy  gentle  and 
pleasing  words  are  sufficient  entertainment.  Moreover,  thou 
hast  already  presented  me  with  fruits  and  the  clear  water  of 
thy  hermitage.  By  meeting  with  thee  alone,  am  I  sufficiently 
honoured.  O  Supremely  Wise  One,  it  was  proper  that  I  should 
offer  obeisance  to  thee ;  now  thou  hast  entertained  me,  allow  me 
to  offer  thee  salutations  and  depart." 

The  great  sage  declined  to  accept  the  king's  refusal  of  his 
offer,  and  still  insisted  that  he  should  entertain  him. 

Then  Vishwamitra  said :  "  Be  it  according  to  thy  pleasure, 
my  Lord,  I  will  do  as  thou  desirest." 

At  these  words,  Shri  Vasishtha  sent  for  his  favourite  spotted 
cow  Kamadhenu  and  said  to  her :  "  O  Shabala,  draw  near  and 
listen  to  me,  I  desire  to  offer  hospitality  to  the  king  and  his  army. 
O  Dear  One,  thou  art  the  wish-fulfilling  cow  and  can  accomplish 
anything,  therefore,  now  prepare  splendid  dishes  which  will  be 
pleasing  to  them,  of  the  six  kinds  of  taste.1  Produce  speedily 
whatever  food  can  be  eaten,  drunk,  licked  or  sucked." 


CHAPTER   53 

The  king  desires  to  possess  Shabala  but  Shri  Vasishtha  will  not 
give  her  up 

The  cow  Shabala  provided  for  the  needs  of  all  according  to 
the  instruction  of  Shri  Vasishtha.  Sugar  cane,  sweets  of  various 
kinds,  honey,  crushed  barley,  wine  and  other  excellent  drinks, 

1  The  six  kinds  of  taste  :  sweet,  bitter,  acid,  salt,  pungent  and  acrid.

hot  rice  in  heaps  as  high  as  mountains,  milk,  curry  and  other 
fare  combining  the  six  tastes  and  countless  other  dishes  with 
sweets  made  of  jagari1  were  distributed.  Each  was  wholly 
satisfied  and  delighted  with  the  hospitality  of  Shri  Vasishtha, 
who  accorded  to  all  the  companions  and  retainers  of  King 
Vishwamitra  the  full  extent  of  their  desires. 

The  king  with  his  family  priests,  ministers  and  attendants, 
partaking  of  the  feast  offered  with  generosity  and  respect  by 
the  great  sage,  was  highly  gratified. 

When  all  the  counsellors  and  personal  attendants  and  the  army 
had  received  full  hospitality,  the  king,  wholly  satisfied,  said  to 
Shri  Vasishtha :  "  O  Holy  Sage,  thou  hast  entertained  me 
royally,  please  hear  what  I  have  to  say  O  Eloquent  One !  O 
Lord,  give  me  the  cow  Shabala  in  exchange  for  a  hundred 
thousand  excellent  cows.  Shabala  is  a  jewel  and  by  a  king 
should  jewels  be  enjoyed — according  to  the  natural  law,  this 
treasure  should  therefore  be  mine." 

Shri  Vasishtha  answered,  saying :  "  O  King,  I  will  not  part 
with  Shabala  in  exchange  for  ten  million  cows,  still  less  for 
a  hundred  thousand.  If  thou  did'st  offer  me  mountains  of  silver 
yet  would  I  refuse  to  give  thee  Shabala  for  she  must  remain 
in  my  hermitage. 

"  O  King,  as  a  righteous  man  cares  for  his  good  name,  so 
do  I  for  Shabala.  She  helps  me  to  satisfy  the  devas,  the  pittris 
and  other  beings.  My  sacred  fire  sacrifice  and  other  Vedic  rites, 
besides  the  various  branches  of  learning  depend  on  Shabala. 
O  Great  Ruler,  indeed  I  cannot  relinquish  this  cow,  she  is 
my  all  and  she  fulfils  all  my  needs — for  these  and  numerous 
other  reasons  do  I  refuse  to  yield  the  cow  to  thee.  O  King, 
verily  I  will  not  part  with  Shabala." 

The  words  of  Shri  Vasishtha  merely  increased  the  king's 
desire  and  he,  under  great  emotion,  declared  with  passion : 
"  O  Great  Muni,  I  will  give  thee  fourteen  thousand  elephants 
adorned  with  golden  trappings,  ornaments  and  goads  and,  in 
addition,  I  will  give  thee  a  hundred  and  eight  chariots  made 
of  solid  gold,  each  driven  by  four  milk  white  horses.  At  the 
same  time,  I  offer  thee  eleven  thousand  well-trained  horses, 
each  with  a  golden  harness  and  further  ten  million  cows  of 

1  Jagari — coarse  brown  Indian  sugar  made  from  palm  tap.

varied  colours,  that  ate  young  and  healthy.  O  give  me  Shabala, 
and  I  will  give  thee  in  exchange  as  much  gold  as  thou  desirest. 
Grant  me  Shabala,  I  implore  thee,  and  accept  my  gifts,  O  Sage." 
Then  the  wise  Vasishtha  said :  "  Under  no  condition  can  I 
part  with  Shabala,  O  King,  she  is  my  jewel  and  my  wealth. 
She  is  my  very  life,  my  all-in-all,  and  she  furnishes  me  with 
alms  and  all  I  require  for  sacrifice.  In  brief,  O  King,  Shabala 
is  the  source  of  my  spiritual  life  and  I  will  never  give  her 
up." 


CHAPTER     54 

King  Viskwamtra  attempts  to  carry  her  away  by  force 

O  Rama,  perceiving  that  Shri  Vasishtha  would  not  willingly 
consent  to  part  with  the  cow,  Vishwamitra  resolved  to  carry 
her  away  by  force. 

O  Raghava,  while  Shabala  was  being  forcibly  carried  off, 
distracted  with  grief,  she  began  to  reflect  thus  :  "  Why  has  the 
holy  Vasishtha  abandoned  me  ?  In  what  way  have  I  offended 
the  holy  sage  ?  Why  are  the  servants  of  the  king  dragging  me 
away  from  the  hermitage  ?  I  am  innocent  and  docile,  the  holy 
muni  is  dear  to  me ;  what  fault  have  I  committed  that  the 
Mahatma  Vasishtha  should  abandon  me  ?  " 

Sighing  again  and  again,  Shabala,  shaking  off  the  hands  of 
the  king's  attendants,  swiftly  ran  and  placed  her  head  at  the  feet 
of  the  holy  sage.  Standing  before  Shri  Vasishtha,  shedding  tears 
and  lamenting  loudly,  she  cried :  "  O  Lord,  O  Son  of  Brahma 
hast  thou  verily  abandoned  me  ?  Why  are  the  servants  of  the 
king  taking  me  away  from  thy  presence,  by  force  ?  " 

Seeing  the  sorely  stricken  Shabala,  Shri  Vasishtha  addressed 
her  as  he  would  his  own  sister,  saying :  "  O  Shabala,  it  is  not 
by  my  will  that  thou  art  thus  being  carried  away,  neither  hast 
thou  offended  me  in  any  way,  O  Dear  One.  Drunk  with  desire, 
the  king  is  taking  thee  from  me  by  force.  I  have  not  the  power 
to  defend  thee.  The  king  is  a  warrior  and  lord  of  the  earth, 
he  is  attended  by  a  mighty  army  with  horses,  elephants  and 
chariots,  verily  he  is  mightier  than  I." 
106 


BALA    KANDA 

Shabala,  who  was  skilled  in  argument,  listened  to  the  words 
of  Shri  Vasishtha  and  said :  "  O  Holy  Sage,  the  power  of  a 
warrior  is  as  nought  compared  to  that  of  a  holy  sage. 
O  Illustrious  Lord,  the  strength  of  a  sage  is  divine  and  based 
on  the  exercise  of  spiritual  practices  and  discipline,  it  is  therefore 
limitless;  thou  art,  O  Lord,  immeasurably  stronger  than  a 
kshatriya.  The  power  of  that  mighty  king  Vishwamitra,  is 
great,  but  he  cannot  equal  thy  strength  and  splendour.  O  Lord, 
through  thy  strength  and  energy  suffer  me  to  destroy  the  power 
and  pride  of  this  wicked  wretch." 

Shri  Vasishtha  answered :  "  Be  it  so  !  Create  an  army  by 
thy  spiritual  energy,  that  will  destroy  the  forces  of  the  king." 

Lowing  loudly,  Shabala,  in  obedience  to  the  sage,  instantly 
produced  hundreds  of  foreign  soldiers,  who  began  to  destroy 
the  army  of  Vishwamitra  while  he  was  looking  on.  Perceiving 
his  army  about  to  be  overthrown,  King  Vishwamitra  became 
enraged  and,  mounting  his  chariot,  his  eyes  red  with  anger, 
he  advanced  to  the  attack.  With  various  weapons,  he  began 
to  slay  thousands  of  men,  and  Shabala,  seeing  the  army  created 
by  her,  annihilated,  now  produced  strange  beings  called  shakas 
in  such  numbers,  that  they  filled  the  whole  earth.  Highly 
valorous,  their  skins  shining  like  gold,  clad  in  yellow  armour, 
furnished  with  scimitars  and  maces,  they  started  to  consume 
the  army  of  Vishwamitra  like  a  raging  fire. 

Then  the  great  Vishwamitra,  with  the  aid  of  yogic  weapons, 
began  to  create  disorder  in  the  ranks  of  the  forces  produced 
by  Shabala. 


chapter   55 

Shabala  creates  an  army  which  annihilates  Vishwamitra' s 
forces 

AS  the  mighty   warriors  fell,  pierced  by  the  weapons  of  \ 
Vishwamitra^  forces,  Shri  Vasishtha  said  to  Shabala:    "O 
Shabala,  create  more  warriors  by  the  power  of  Yoga." 

107 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Shabala,  lowing  loudly,  produced  well-armed  soldiers  from 
her  feet  and  udders,  and  from  her  hair  and  thighs  were  born 
the  extraordinary  warriors  Harita  and  Kirata.  By  these,  the 
whole  army  of  Vishwamitra  consisting  of  elephants,  horses  and 
chariots,  was  instantly  destroyed.  Beholding  their  entire  army 
exterminated  by  the  power  of  Shri  Vasishtha,  King  Vishwami- 
tra's  hundred  sons  bearing  mighty  arms  and  with  various 
thought-propelled  weapons  rushed  angrily  at  the  holy  Sage 
Vasishtha.  Shri  Vasishtha  merely  uttered  the  sound  "  H'm !  " 
and  they  were  all  immediately  consumed.  By  the  great  Sage 
Vasishtha,  the  infantry,  cavalry  and  chariots,  together  with  the 
sons  of  King  Vishwamitra,  were  instantly  burned  to  ashes. 

Then  the  illustrious  monarch  Vishwamitra  whose  sons  and 
army  had  been  annihilated,  was  filled  with  shame  and  dismay. 
Deprived  of  his  glory,  he  resembled  a  waveless  ocean  or  a  snake 
bereft  of  its  fangs  or  the  sun  under  eclipse.  Like  a  bird  without 
wings,  his  confidence  shattered,  his  pride  humbled,  he  became 
filled  with  anxiety.  Bestowing  the  kingdom  on  his  only  remain- 
ing son,  he  exhorted  him  to  rule  according  to  dharma  and  then 
himself  retired  to  the  forest  to  practise  asceticism. 

After  some  time,  he  found  favour  with  Shri  Mahadeva1  the 
magnanimous  granter  of  boons,  and  he,  appearing  before 
Vishwamitra,  addressed  him  saying  :  "  O  King,  why  art  thou 
undergoing  penance  ?  What  is  thy  desire  ?  I  will  grant  thee 
whatsoever  thou  asketh  ?  " 

Shri  Vishwamitra  making  obeisance  to  Shri  Mahadeva  said 
to  him :  "  O  Great  God,  if  I  have  found  favour  with  thee, 
then  instruct  me  in  the  Upanishads  and  other  branches  of 
learning,  teach  me  also  the  mysteries  and  the  science  of  archery. 
Whatever  weapons  are  known  to  the  danavas,  yakshas,  asuras 
and  other  beings,  let  them  be  revealed  to  me  by  thy  grace." 

On  hearing  the  request  of  the  king,  Shri  Shiva  answered, 
"  Be  it  so  "  and  returned  to  his  abode. 

King  Vishwamitra,  having  acquired  the  various  weapons  from 
Mahadeva,  became  as  happy  as  the  sea  at  the  time  of  the  full 
moon.  He  now  resolved  to  subdue  the  Sage  Vasishtha  and 
regarded  him  as  his  captive  already. 

Proceeding  to  his  hermitage  he  discharged  his  great  weapons 

1  Mahadeva — Great  God,  a  name  of  Shiva.

BALA    KANDA 

like  rain,  setting  the  forest  of  Tapovan  ablaze.  Afflicted  by  these 
dreadful  weapons,  all  the  sages  began  to  flee  to  the  four  quarters 
in  terror ;  even  the  disciples  of  Shri  Vasishtha,  together  with 
innumerable  birds  and  beasts,  escaped  hastily  in  every  direction. 
The  hermitage  of  Shri  Vasishtha  became  deserted  and  a  deep 
silence  fell  upon  it,  causing  it  to  resemble  a  barren  field. 

Shri  Vasishtha  repeatedly  called  out :  "  Fear  not,  fear  not, 
I  will  destroy  Vishwamitra  as  the  sun  dispels  the  morning 
mist." 

Then  the  great  Sage  Vasishtha,  foremost  among  those  who 
practise  silent  prayer,  angrily  addressed  Vishwamitra  saying : 
"  Thou  hast  destroyed  my  ancient  and  auspicious  hermitage, 
O  Wicked  and  Deluded  Wretch,  thou  thyself  shalt  be  destroyed." 

Snatching  up  his  staff  equal  to  the  rod  of  Yama,  he  advanced 
like  a  naked  name. 


CHAPTER    56 

Shri  Vasishtha  by  his  spiritual  strength  conquers  Vishwamitra 
who  then  engages  in  penances 

Hearing  the  harsh  words  uttered  by  Shri  Vasishtha,  Vishwami- 
tra raising  the  fire  weapon,  cried :  "  Stay !    Beware  !  " 

Then  Shri  Vasishtha,  lifting  up  his  Brahma  staff  in  wrath, 
exclaimed :  "  O  Vilest  of  Warriors,  here  I  stand,  let  loose  all 
thy  weapons,  not  excepting  those  propelled  by  thought  which 
thou  hast  obtained  from  the  Lord  Shiva.  O  Son  of  Gadhi, 
to-day  I  will  deprive  thee  of  all  these  weapons.  How  can  thy 
power  as  a  warrior  compare  with  that  of  a  divine  sage  ?  O 
Stupid  Wretch,  behold  my  divine  energy !  " 

So  saying,  Shri  Vasishtha  quenched  the  dangerous  fire  weapon 
hurled  at  him  by  Vishwamitra  as  water  quenches  fire. 

Then  the  son  of  Gadhi  let  fly  other  dangerous  weapons 

upon  the  holy  sage,  the  Varuna,  the  Rudra,  the  Indra,  the 

Pashupata  and  Ishika  weapons  together  with  the  Manava, 

Mohana,  Gandharva,  Swapana,  Jrimbhana,  Viadana,  Santapana, 

109 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  Vilapana ;  the  Shoshaua,  Darana  and  the  terrible  Vatra ; 
the  Brahma-pasha  and  Kalapasha,  the  Varuna-pasha  and  the 
priceless  Pinaka  and  also  the  missiles  Shushka  and  Ardra,  the 
Danda  weapon  and  the  Pisacha,  the  Krouncha  and  the  Dharma- 
discus,  the  Kala  discus  and  the  discus  of  Vishnu,  also  the 
weapon  Vayuvya,  Mathana  and  Haya-shira  did  he  discharge 
upon  the  great  sage  with  the  two  Shaktis,  the  Kankala,  Mushala, 
Vidyadhara,  Kala,  the  trident  Kapala  and  the  Kankana.  All 
these  did  he  hurl  at  the  holy  sage. 

Then  Shri  Vasishtha  accomplished  a  great  marvel  and  by 
means  of  his  staff  alone  destroyed  all  the  weapons  of  Vishwamitra. 
Seeing  these  weapons  rendered  ineffectual,  Vishwamitra  raised 
the  Brahman-astra.  At  this,  Agni,  the  divine  sages  and  the 
celestial  beings  were  seized  with  terror  and  the  three  worlds 
shook  with  fear.  But  by  means  of  ins  spiritual  power  and  the 
study  and  practice  of  Brahman- Vidya,  Shri  Vasishtha  subdued 
the  Brahman-astra.  As  Shri  Vasishtha  consumed  this  tremen- 
dous weapon,  his  charming  and  pleasing  mien  became  terrible 
and  from  each  pore  of  his  body  shafts  of  light  shot  forth  while 
the  staff  of  the  holy  sage,  shining  like  fire,  burst  into  flame. 

All  the  sages  now  began  to  praise  Shri  Vasishtha,  saying : 
"  Thy  power  is  without  equal  and  ever  productive  of  good, 
by  the  power  of  thy  Yoga,  pacify  the  Brahman-astra.  O  Holy 
Sage,  thou  hast  humbled  the  pride  of  Vishwamitra.  O  Great 
Ascetic,  be  pacified,  that  we  also  may  be  delivered  from  fear." 

Thus  addressed,  Shri  Vasishtha  assumed  his  accustomed  mien 
and  Vishwamitra,  being  defeated,  sighing  heavily,  exclaimed  : 
"  Woe,  woe  to  the  might  of  a  warrior !  The  real  power  is 
the  spiritual  power.  Shri  Vasishtha  by  his  spiritual  strength 
has  fully  conquered  mine.  I  will,  therefore,  abandon  my 
warlike  nature  and  seek  to  obtain  brahmanhood."

Shri  Vasishtha  refuses  to  help  King  Trishanku  enter  heaven 
in  his  physical  state 

The  heart  of  Vishwamitra  was  heavy,  remembering  his  disgrace, 
and  he  was  filled  with  remorse  at  having  borne  enmity  to  Shri 
Vasishtha. 

O  Rama,  with  his  queen  he  went  to  the  southern  quarter 
and  began  his  great  ascetic  penance  there. 

After  a  long  time  four  sons  were  bom  to  him,  each  a  devotee 
of  truth,  who  were  virtuous  and  of  great  military  prowess.  Their 
names  were  Havisyanda,  Madhusyanda,  Drirha-netra  and 
Maharatha. 

Having  practised  severe  austerities  for  a  thousand  years,  the 
Grandsire  of  the  world,  Shri  Brahma  appeared  before  Vishwami- 
tra and  said :  "  O  Son  of  Kaushika,  thou  hast  surpassed  the 
royal  sages  in  thy  great  asceticism,  thou  shalt,  therefore,  be 
numbered  among  them."  Having  thus  spoken,  Shri  Brahma 
with  the  gods  went  to  Brahmaloka. 

Vishwamitra  was  filled  with  shame  and  with  bowed  head, 
overcome  with  grief,  thus  spoke :  "Alas  !  In  spite  of  prolonged 
austerities,  the  gods  still  hold  me  to  be  a  -royal  sage.1  I  deem 
this  state  no  reward  for  the  penance  I  have  undergone." 

O  Rama,  with  renewed  resolve,  Vishwamitra,  pre-eminent  in 
the  field  of  endeavour  began  his  life  of  mortification  anew. 

At  this  time,  the  great  King  Trishanku  of  the  House  of 
Ikswaku,  fully  self-subdued  and  a  lover  of  truth,  resolved  to 
initiate  a  sacrifice  in  order  to  enter  heaven  in  his  physical  body. 
Summoning  the  holy  Sage  Vasishtha,  he  communicated  his 
intention  to  him,  but  the  Mahatma  Vasishtha,  having  duly 
considered  the  matter,  said :  "  O  King,  this  cannot  be." 

Discouraged  by  Shri  Vasishtha  and  for  the  purpose  of  fulfilling 
his  design,  the  monarch  went  southwards  to  where  the  sons 
of  Shri  Vasishtha  abode,  leading  lives  of  purity  and  ascetism. 
When  King  Trishanku  beheld  the  sons  of  his  own  Guru,  that 
great  and  illustrious  sage,  he  was  full  of  shame,  and  with  bowed

head  offered  salutation  to  them,  addressing  them  in  great 
humility  saying,  "  O  Protectors  of  those  who  seek  refuge  in 
you,  I  come  to  seek  your  aid.  O  Holy  Ones,  I  besought 
your  sire  to  assist  me  in  the  observance  of  a  sacrifice  and  he 
discouraged  me.  I  have,  therefore,  come  to  seek  your  help 
in  the  matter.  O  Sons  of  my  Holy  Guru,  I  offer  salutations 
to  you.  Again  and  again,  I  bow  down  to  you,  O  Holy  Ones, 
and  beseech  you  to  officiate  at  the  proposed  sacrifice,  which  I 
desire  to  undertake  for  the  fulfilment  of  my  design,  namely 
that  I  may  ascend  to  heaven  in  my  embodied  state.  Discouraged 
by  the  holy  teacher  Vasishtha,  I  consider  that  you  alone  are 
able  to  assist  me.  Should  you  refuse  me,  there  is  none  in  whom 
I  may  take  refuge.  The  kings  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku  have 
always  sought  guidance  of  their  spiritual  preceptor  in  time  of 
need,  and  the  holy  and  learned  Sage  Vasishtha  has  ever  upheld 
the  dynasty  and,  following  him,  you  alone  are  my 
instructors  ".

The  king  appeals  to  Sftri  Vasisktha's  sons  to  conduct 
the  sacrifice.    They  curse  him  and  he  appeals  to  Vishtoamtra 

O  Rama,  hearing  the  words  of  the  king,  the  hundred  sons  of 
Shri  Vasishtha  were  filled  with  wrath  and  said :  "  O  Thou 
Evil-minded  Wretch,  discouraged  by  thy  spiritual  preceptor, 
how  dost  thou  dare  to  seek  our  aid  ?  O  King,  we  know  thee 
to  be  an  ignorant  man.  Shri  Vasishtha  is  able  to  advance  the 
sacrifices  of  the  three  worlds,  verily  thou  art  no  true  disciple 
of  such  a  sage.  Shall  we  render  void  the  utterance  of  our 
great  sire  ?  " 

Hearing  these  harsh  words,  the  king  replied :  "  Discouraged 
by  my  Guru  and  now  by  you,  I  shall  seek  elsewhere  for  aid ; 
may  all  be  well  with  you." 

The  sons  of  the  great  sage  were  enraged  on  hearing  these 
words  spoken  in  defiance,  and  cursed  the  king,  saying :  "  Mayest 


BALA    KANDA 

thou  become  one  of  the  fallen  caste."  Having  thus  cursed  him, 
they  returned  to  their  hermitage. 

When  the  night  was  over,  the  king  was  transformed  into  a 
low-born  being,  his  complexion  dark,  his  body  emaciated,  his 
head  shaven,  his  whole  frame  besmeared  with  ashes  from  the 
crematorium,  bis  golden  ornaments  changed  to  lead. 

When  the  people  of  the  capital  beheld  the  king  in  this 
condition  they  fled  from  that  place,  and  Trishanku  departed,  full 
of  anguish.  Sunk  in  grief  day  and  night,  he  finally  sought  refuge 
with  Shri  Vishwamitra.  That  sage  seeing  the  monarch  deprived 
of  his  kingdom  and  condemned  to  assume  the  form  of  a  low-caste 
being,  was  moved  with  compassion,  and  addressed  him  saying : 
"  O  Mighty  Prince,  mayest  thou  be  prosperous  !  Why  hast 
thou  come  hither  ?  I  know  thee  to  be  the  Sovereign  of  Ayodhya 
that  through  a  curse  art  come  to  this  state." 

The  eloquent  King  Trishanku,  with  joined  palms,  replied 
in  tones  of  submission :  "  O  Great  One,  discouraged  by  my 
Guru  and  his  sons  in  my  desire  to  enter  heaven  in  the  physical 
body,  I  have  been  transformed  by  them  into  a  chandala.1  Now, 
for  shame,  I  may  not  show  myself  to  any.  O  Lord,  I  have  failed 
to  obtain  the  fruit  of  countless  sacrifices,  an  untruth  has  never 
been  uttered  by  me,  I  have  governed  my  people  with  righteous- 
ness and  by  my  conduct  have  satisfied  my  spiritual  preceptor 
and  holy  men.  I  desired  to  undertake  a  further  meritorious 
sacrifice,  but  O  Great  Sage,  my  Guru  has  withheld  his  aid. 
O  Lord,  destiny  is  irrevocable,  destiny  is  inexorable,  none  can 
withstand  it.  All  are  ruled  by  destiny.  O  Divine  Sage,  be 
favourable  to  me,  who  am  fallen  into  distress  !  Besides  thee, 
there  is  none  in  whom  I  can  take  refuge.  O  Holy  One,  by  thy 
spiritual  energy,  avert  this  evil  fate."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER    59 

Viskwamitra  seeks  the  help  of  the  sons  of  Vasishtha 
and  Mahodeva  ;  they  refuse  and  are  cursed 

Shm  Vishwamitra  heard  the  appeal  of  the  fallen  sovereign  and 
in  sweet  accents  spoke  words  of  comfort,  saying  :  "  O  King, 
thou  art  welcome,  I  know  thee  to  be  wholly  virtuous,  I  will  be 
thy  refuge,  fear  not.  I  shall  invite  hither  the  learned  and  pious 
brahmans  who  will  assist  thee  in  the  performance  of  thy  sacrifice. 
This  thou  shalt  accomplish  and  obtain  heaven  in  the  form 
imposed  on  thee  by  thy  Guru.  O  King}  having  taken  refuge 
in  me,  consider  thy  purpose  already  accomplished." 

Having  uttered  these  words,  Shri  Vishwamitra  commanded 
his  sons  to  prepare  all  things  for  the  sacrifice.  Summoning 
his  disciples,  he  said  to  them :  "  Bring  hither  the  pious  and 
learned  brahmins  and  the  sons  of  Shri  Vasishtha  also.  May 
they  come  with  their  disciples,  their  friends,  the  learned  and 
the  priests.  If  any  disregard  my  word,  let  it  be  reported  to 
me." 

In  obedience  to  the  sage,  the  disciples  set  out  to  every  quarter, 
summoning  the  sages  and  learned  men  from  many  lands. 
Returning,  they  approached  Vishwamitra,  and  said :  "  O  Lord, 
at  thy  command  the  holy  sages  are  coming  hither,  some  are 
already  come,  Mahodeva  excepted ;  but  the  sons  of  holy 
Vasishtha,  transported  with  rage  uttered  harsh  words  of  which 
we  will  tell  thee."  They  said :  "  How  shall  divine  sages 
partake  of  that  sacrifice  undertaken  by  a  chandala,  at  which 
a  kshatriya  officiates  ?  And  how  shall  those  brahmins,  con- 
strained by  Vishwamitra,  partaking  of  the  food  offered  by  a 
chandala,  enter  heaven  ?  " 

O  Great  Sage,  these  are  the  words  of  the  sons  of  Shri 
Vasishtha. 

.Vishwamitra,  his  eyes  red  with  anger,  answered :  "  Why 
should  the  sons  of  Shri  Vasishtha  disregard  me,  who  am  engaged 
in  severe  ascetic  practices  and  without  guilt  ?  By  my  power, 
these  evil-minded  men  shall  this  day  be  consumed  to  ashes 
and  enter  the  abode  of  death.  By  my  curse  they  shall  become 
114 


BALA  KANDA 
of  those  who  subsist  on  the  dead  for  a  hundred  incarnations. 
They  shall  eat  the  flesh  of  dogs  and  be  called  *  Musthika  \ 
Despised  by  all,  they  shall  wander  about  among  men  and  may 
the  wicked  Mahodeva  also,  having  imputed  blame  to  me,  be 
born  as  a  fowler,  for  a  long  time  becoming  the  pitiless  destroyer 
of  other's  lives  and  by  my  wrath  may  he  sink  to  a  miserable 
and  abject  state." 

Sitting  amid  the  sages,  the  Sage  Vishwamitra  having  pro- 
nounced this  curse,  became  silent. 


CHAPTER    60 

Through  fear  of  Vishwamitra,  the  sages  assist  in  the  sacrifice 
and  King  Trishanku  ascends  to  a  specially  created  heaven 

Having  stricken  the  sons  of  Shri  Vasishtha  by  the  power  of 
his  asceticism,  Vishwamitra,  seated  amidst  the  sages,  spoke  : — 

"  The  renowned  monarch  Trishanku  of  the  dynasty  of 
Ikshwaku,  who  is  both  magnanimous  and  virtuous,  has  taken 
refuge  with  me.  He  is  desirous  of  entering  heaven  in  his 
embodied  state,  it  is  for  me  to  accomplish  it.  O  Sages,  do  you 
unitedly  assist  him  in  this  sacrifice." 

The  sages  hearing  the  words  of  Vishwamitra  and  being 
acquainted  with  the  tradition,  consulted  together  saying :  "  The 
son  of  Kaushika,  the  Risni  Vishwamitra,  is  given  to  wrath.  If 
we  do  not  fulfil  his  desire,  like  a  consuming  fire  he  will  pour  out 
his  curse  upon  us.  Let  us,  therefore,  assist  him  in  the  sacrifice 
so  that  the  king  may  enter  heaven  in  his  physical  body.  Now 
let  us  inaugurate  the  rites." 

Then  the  rites  began,  as  prescribed  by  ancient  tradition, 
Vishwamitra  acting  as  the  chief  priest  and  the  learned  brahmins 
becoming  the  sacrificing  priests  subordinate  to  him.  Observing 
numerous  rituals,  the  sacrifice  continued  for  a  long  time.  Then 
Shri  Vishwamitra  called  thither  the  gods  for  their  share  of  the 
sacrifice,  but  none  of  these  celestial  beings  appeared.  At  this 
"5 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  great  sage  grew  exceedingly  wroth  and  lifting  up  the  sacrificial 
vessel,  said  to  the  King  Trishanku  :  "  O  King,  behold  the  power 
of  my  asceticism  by  virtue  of  which  I  now  send  thee  to  heaven 
in  thy  embodied  state.  O  King,  though  it  is  deemed  impossible 
to  accomplish  this,  by  the  power  acquired  by  me  I  now  say 
to  thee ;  *  ascend  to  heaven  in  thy  physical  form.' " 

Having  uttered  these  words,  King  Trishanku,  in  the  presence 
of  the  sages  instantly  ascended  to  the  heavens. 

Seeing  Trishanku  there,  Indra  and  all  the  other  gods 
exclaimed :  "  O  Trishanku,  thou  hast  no  place  in  heaven. 
Cursed  by  thy  Guru,  O  Stupid  Wretch,  do  thou  fall  headlong 
to  the  earth/' 

Trishanku  accordingly  instantly  began  to  fall  towards  the 
earth  crying  out  to  Shri  Vishwamitra,  "  Protect  me  ",  "  Protect 
me". 

Shri  Vishwamitra,  hearing  the  cry,  grew  angry,  and  called 
out, "  Stay,  Stay  ".  At  that  moment,  standing  amidst  the  sages, 
the  great  rishi  resembled  Prajapati.  Thereafter  he  created  seven 
planets  in  the  southern  quarter  called  the  Seven  Rishis,  and  then 
he  created  the  Ashwini  and  twenty-seven  other  stars.  Seated 
amidst  the  sages,  filled  with  wrath,  Vishwamitra  reflected  in 
himself:  "  I  will  create  another  Indra  or  I  will  leave  this  heaven 
without  an  Indra.  Nay,  I  will  make  Trishanku  Lord  of  this 
heaven,"  and  he  began  to  create  a  new  circle  of  gods. 

Upon  this,  the  sages,  gods  and  celestial  beings,  bewildered 
and  perturbed,  approached  Vishwamitra  and  said  with  humility : 
"  O  Great  Sage,  this  king  has  been  cursed  by  bis  spiritual 
preceptor  and  is  not  worthy  of  heaven." 

Shri  Vishwamitra  answered  them,  saying :  "  Hear,  O  ye  Gods, 
I  have  vowed  that  this  king  should  enter  heaven  in  his  embodied 
state,  this  pledge  must  be  fulfilled.  To  this  end,  I  have  created 
the  Pole  star  and  other  planets  and  this  heaven  will  abide  as  long 
as  the  former  heaven  endures,  as  also  the  gods  created  by  me, 
it  becomes  you,  therefore,  to  confirm  what  I  have 
promised." 

The  gods  in  awe,  having  heard  these  words,  answered  :  "  Be 

it  so,  0  Illustrious  Rishi,  the  heaven  created  by  thee  shall  endure 

beyond  the  Path  of  Vishwanara,  and  let  Trishanku,  suspended 

head  downwards,  remain  as  if  immortal  among  these  shining 

Il6 


BALA    KANDA 

stars.  As  the  stars  attend  on  famous  and  successful  men,  so 
let  these  brilliant  luminaries,  created  by  thee,  attend  on  King 
Trishanku." 

Shri  Vishwamitra,  extolled  by  the  gods,  acquiesced  in  their 
proposal. 

After  this,  O  Rama,  the  gods  and  the  ascetics  who  had 
attended  the  sacrifice,  returned  to  their  own  regions. 


chapter  61 

King  Ambariska's  sacrificial  horse  is  lost  and  he  seeks 
a  human  victim 

O  Rama,  when  Vishwamitra  saw  the  sages  departing,  he  said 
to  the  dwellers  of  the  Tapovana  forest :  "  In  the  southern  region, 
great  obstructions  have  hindered  my  penances,  I  shall  therefore 
go  to  another  quarter  to  perform  austerity.  To  the  west  of 
this  place,  at  the  sacred  spot  named  Pushkara,  there  is  a  large 
and  beautiful  forest  where  I  shall  continue  my  practices  un- 
disturbed." 

Reaching  that  place,  the  great  sage  engaging  in  occult  practices, 
subsisted  on  fruit  and  roots. 

Meanwhile,  King  Ambarisha  of  Ayodhya  inaugurated  the 
horse  sacrifice,  but  the  horse  was  carried  away  by  Indra,  on 
which  the  priest  addressed  the  monarch,  saying :  "  O  King, 
it  is  for  thee  to  protect  the  sacrificial  steed,  the  horse  has  been 
stolen  away  owing  to  thy  negligence,  therefore,  provide  another 
or  seek  a  human  victim,  so  that  the  sacrifice  may  be  accomplished 
without  further  hindrance." 

Hearing  these  words,  the  renowned  monarch  offered  thousands 
of  cows  to  whosoever  should  find  either  a  horse,  or  human  being. 
Seeking  the  sacrificial  beast,  the  illustrious  sovereign  passed 
through  many  countries,  cities  and  forests,  and  entered  hermit- 
ages and  sacred  places. 

At  length,  the  King  Ambarisha  beheld  Richika  the  Sage, 
with  his  sons  and  wife  dwelling  on  the  mountain  Bhrigutunga. 
"7 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMJKI 

Making  obeisance  to  him,  the  king  honoured  him  in  various  ways 
and  enquired  as  to  his  welfare.  He  then  said  to  him  :  "  If  it 
be  agreeable  to  thee,  grant  me  one  of  thy  sons  in  exchange  for 
a  hundred  thousand  cows.  After  searching  many  countries, 
I  have  not  found  either  a  horse  or  a  human  victim  for  the 
sacrifice.  O  Lord,  do  thou,  therefore,  deliver  thy  son  to  me 
and  accede  to  my  request." 

Richika  answered :  "  O  King,  I  will  never  bestow  my  eldest 
son  on  any."  His  wife  then  said :  "  My  Lord  does  not  wish 
to  part  with  the  eldest  son,  but  the  youngest  son  Shunaka  is 
dearest  to  me,  I  shall  not  part  with  him.  O  Great  Muni,  the 
eldest  son  is  beloved  of  his  father  and  the  youngest  is  dear 
to  his  mother,  therefore,  these  two  should  not  be  taken  away." 

O  Rama,  the  middle  son,  whose  name  was  Shunashepha, 
hearing  these  words,  spoke  thus :  "  My  father  does  not  wish 
to  part  with  his  eldest  son,  nor  my  mother  with  her  youngest, 
therefore,  take  me,  O  King." 

O  Rama,  the  king  gave  the  Sage  Richika  a  hundred  thousand 
cows  in  exchange  for  Shunashepha  and,  mounting  his  chariot, 
started  with  him  on  his  homeward  journey. 


CHAPTER     62 

Shunashepha,  the  human  victim,  seeks  and  obtains  help 
from  Vishwamitra 

O  Rama,  the  illustrious  King  Ambarisha,  accompanied  by 
Shunashepha,  having  in  the  afternoon  reached  Pushkara,  rested 
there.  While  the  king  rested,  Shunashepha,  going  to  a  certain 
spot,  beheld  Shri  Vishwamitra,  his  maternal  uncle,  engaged 
with  other  sages  in  the  performance  of  spiritual  practices  and  he, 
sorrowful,  thirsty  and  fatigued,  fell  at  the  feet  of  the  sage,  and 
said :  "  O  Lord,  for  me  there  is  neither  father,  mother,  relative 
nor  caste.  O  Peaceful  Sage,  O  Sovereign  among  ascetics,  1 
take  refuge  in  thee ;  in  the  name  of  dharma,  deliver  me.  Thou 
can'st  protect  the  whole  world,  how  much  more  one  so  insignifi- 
118 


BALA    KANDA 

cant  as  myself.  Do  thou  assist  the  king  in  the  completion  of 
his  sacrifice  that  it  may  be  accomplished  without  hindrance, 
and  may  I  live  and  by  means  of  my  spiritual  practices  obtain 
heaven.  Thou  art  my  master  who  am  masterless.  Protect  me, 
wretched  as  I  am,  as  a  father  protects  his  child." 

Shri  Vishwamitra,  hearing  the  piteous  words  of  Shunashepha 
addressed  his  own  sons,  saying :  "  O  My  Sons,  that  world 
for  which  fathers  beget  their  children  is  at  hand,1  this  child 
is  the  son  of  the  Sage  Richika  and  has  taken  refuge  in  me, 
let  us  protect  his  life.  You  are  all  virtuous  and  charitable, 
let  one  of  you  take  the  place  of  the  sacrificial  victim  at  the 
king's  sacrifice,  and  thus  satisfy  the  God  Agni.  In  this  way, 
we  can  rescue  Shunasnepha.  Assist  me  in  the  completion  of 
the  king's  sacrifice,  propitiate  the  gods,  and  enable  me  to  be 
true  to  my  word." 

Hearing  these  words,  Madhusyanda  and  the  other  sons 
sullenly  replied  to  Vishwamitra,  saying :  "  O  King  of  Kings, 
would'st  thou  abandon  thine  own  sons  and  protect  another's  ? 
Such  an  action  resembles  the  relinquishing  of  a  tasty  dish  to 
partake  of  the  flesh  of  a  dog." 

Hearing  this  reply,  Shri  Vishwamitra  grew  angry  and,  his  eyes 
inflamed  with  wrath,  he  said :  "  Your  speech  is  arrogant  and 
contrary  to  dharma,  it  is  a  violation  of  filial  affection.  I  regard 
you  all  as  insubordinate,  therefore,  I  now  curse  you.  Like  the 
sons  of  Shri  Vasishtha,  may  you  fall  from  your  high  caste  and, 
eating  the  flesh  of  dogs,  wander  about  in  the  world  during  the 
period  of  a  thousand  years  !  " 

Having  thus  cursed  his  sons,  the  muni,  offering  Shunashepha 
his  protection,  thus  instructed  him :  "  O  Son  of  a  Sage,  at 
King  Ambarisha's  sacrifice,  allow  thyself  to  be  bound,  adorned 
with  the  red  garland,  besmeared  with  sandalwood  paste  and  tied 
to  the  sacrificial  post.  I  will  impart  to  thee  two  mantrams, 
which  when  repeated,  will  deliver  thee." 

The  holy  sage  then  carefully  instructed  him  in  the  sacred 
formulas.  Thereafter,  Shunashepha  approached  the  king  and 
said :  "  O  Illustrious  Monarch,  now  enter  upon  the  initiation 
without  delay  and  accomplish  the  performance  of  thy  sacrifice." 

1  The  Hindu  regard  their  heme  of  a  future  existence  to  depend  to  a  great  extent 
cm  their  ions  performing  their  obsequies. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

The  king,  filled  with  joy,  went  without  delay  to  the  sacrificial 
pavilion.  With  the  consent  of  the  officiating  priest,  the  king 
now  dressed  Shunashepha  in  red  attire  and  tied  him  to  the  post 
as  the  consecrated  victim.  Being  bound,  Shunashepha  began 
to  praise  Upendra1  by  reciting  the  mantrams  he  had  been  given 
by  Vishwamitra. 

Indra,  pleased  with  the  worship  of  Shunashepha,  bestowed 
the  blessing  of  long  life  on  him. 

O  Rama,  then  did  the  king  complete  his  sacrifice  and  obtain 
the  desired  fruit  from  Indra. 

Thereafter,  the  righteous  Vishwamitra  renewed  his  yogic 
penance  in  Fushkara  and  performed  it  there  for  a  thousand 
years. 


CHAPTER    63 

After  more  austerities  Vishwamitra  is  proclaimed 
a  Maharishi 

Shri  Vishwamitra  passed  a  thousand  years  in  the  practice  of 
mortification,  then  the  gods  came  to  bestow  on  him  the  fruits 
of  his  asceticism.  The  supreme  Brahma  addressed  him  in 
pleasing  accents,  saying :  "  O  Holy  One,  mayest  thou  be 
prosperous,  thou  an  now  become  a  rishi  by  virtue  of  thy  great 
austerities."  Having  said  this,  Shri  Brahma  and  the  other 
celestial  beings  returned  to  their  own  spheres. 

Vishwamitra  again  engaged  in  severe  austerity  and  in  this 
way  passed  many  more  years.  While  thus  employed,  the 
celestial  nymph  Menaka  came  to  bathe  in  the  Pushkara  lake. 
Resembling  lightning  illumining  a  cloud,  her  beauty  stirred 
the  passion  of  Vishwamitra  and  he  said  to  her : — 
"  Be  gracious  to  me  for  I  am  filled  with  a  great  love  for  thee." 
Then  that  beautiful  one  agreed  to  take  up  her  abode  in  the 
hermitage  of  the  rishi.  The  penances  of  Vishwamitra  were  thus 
rendered  void  by  the  presence  of  Menaka  in  the  hermitage. 
O  Rama,  that  nymph  passed  ten  years  in  that  place. 

1  Upendra — a  name  of  Indra. 

120 


BALA    KANDA 

After  this  time,  Shri  Vishwamitra  perceiving  himself  to  have 
been  deluded,  was  filled  with  shame  and  he  reflected  on  the 
cause  of  his  infatuation.  Then  he  adjudged  the  gods  to  have 
devised  this  plan  to  bring  his  ascetism  to  nought  and  he  cried 
out :  "  What,  have  I  passed  ten  years  with  this  woman,  as  it 
were  a  night.  Alas !  My  great  austerities  are  destroyed  by 
this  passion." 

Sighing  heavily  and  filled  with  remorse,  he  beheld  Menaka 
trembling  with  fear,  standing  near,  but  Vishwamitra  addressing 
her  in  reassuring  words,  bade  her  farewell. 

Having  controlled  his  passions,  Shri  Vishwamitra  went  to 
the  northern  mountains  and  began  to  perform  penance  in  the 
Himalayas  on  the  bank  of  the  Kaushiki  river. 

Then,  O  Rama,  the  gods  were  filled  with  fear  by  the  austerities 
practised  by  the  rishi  on  the  Himalayan  mountains,  and  approach- 
ing Shri  Brahma  said : — 

"  O  Grandsire,  now  grant  the  title  of  maharishi  to  Shri 
Vishwamitra." 

Shri  Brahma  then  appeared  before  Vishwamitra  and  in  gentle 
accents  said  to  him :  "  Hail  to  Thee,  O  Rishi,  I  am  pleased 
with  thine  austerity.     I  name  thee  chief  among  the  rishis." 

Then  Vishwamitra,  making  obeisance  to  Shri  Brahma,  spoke 
submissively  saying :  *'  O  Lord,  these  penances  have  been 
undertaken  by  me  that  I  might  become  a  brahmarishi.  Since 
thou  still  namest  me  maharishi,  I  regard  myself  as  not  yet  fully 
self-subdued." 

Shri  Brahma  answered,  saying :  "  So  it  is,  thou  hast  not  yet 
fully  gained  the  mastery  over  thy  senses.  O  Great  Muni, 
undergo  further  penance."  Having  uttered  these  words,  Shri 
Brahma  returned  to  the  celestial  regions. 

Then  Vishwamitra  began  an  exceedingly  severe  penance, 
standing  unsupported  with  his  arms  raised,  living  only  on  air ; 
in  the  summer  season,  standing  in  the  midst  of  five  fires, 
in  the  rainy  season  lying  without  a  canopy,  in  the  winter 
practising  his  spiritual  discipline  in  water,  thus  did  he  pass 
a  thousand  years. 

Perceiving  Vishwamitra  undergoing  these  severe  penances, 
the  gods  were  greatly  perturbed.    At  length  their  lord,  Indra, 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

approached  the  nymph  Rambha  and  begged  her  to  promote 
his  interest  and  cause  harm  to  Vishwamitra. 


CHAPTER    64 

Indra  is  perturbed  and  sends  Rambha  to  disturb  the  further 
austerities  of  the  Sage 

Indra  thus  addressed  Rambha  saying :  "  O  Rambha,  it  is  for 
thee  to  accomplish  this  great  work  and  stimulate  the  passions 
of  the  great  Sage  Vishwamitra,  so  that  his  spiritual  practices 
may  be  rendered  void.** 

O  Rama,  Rambha,  filled  with  apprehension  on  hearing  the 
words  of  Indra,  said  in  humility :  "  O  Indra,  the  Rishi 
Vishwamitra  is  easily  moved  to  wrath,  he  will  certainly  curse 
me  if  I  approach  him.  I  fear  to  enter  his  presence,  do  not 
therefore  ask  me  to  undertake  this  task." 

To  Rambha,  trembling  with  fear,  standing  with  joined  palms, 
in  token  of  submission,  Indra  made  answer  :  "  O  Rambha,  fear 
not,  accomplish  my  desire,  may  success  attend  thee  ! 

In  the  spring  season,  assuming  the  form  of  a  cuckoo  calling 
sweedy,  accompanied  by  the  god  of  love,  I  will  take  my  place 
on  a  blossoming  tree  not  far  from  thee.  O  Rambha,  attired  in 
beautiful  and  charming  apparel  do  thou  divert  the  mind  of  the 
muni  from  his  spiritual  practices." 

At  the  instance  of  Indra,  that  lovely  nymph  clad  in  enchanting 
raiment,  faintly  smiling,  went  forth  to  allure  the  heart  of  Shri 
Vishwamitra. 

At  that  moment,  the  liquid  notes  of  the  cuckoo  began  to 
delight  the  rishi  and  he  then  beheld  the  nymph  Rambha. 
Stirred  by  the  cuckoo's  note  and  the  ravishing  sound  of  the 
beautiful  Rambha's  song,  Shri  Vishwamitra,  recollecting  his 
former  fall,  was  filled  with  misgiving  and  recognizing  the  design 
of  the  god  Indra,  transported  with  rage,  cursed  Rambha, 
saying:— 

"  O  Rambha,  O  Unfortunate  One,  thou  hast  come  hither 
122 


BALA    KANDA 

to  lure  me  from  my  penance,  I,  who  have  conquered  lust  and 
anger.  Mayest  thou  become  petrified  and  take  the  form  of  a 
rock  for  ten  thousand  years.  A  brahmin  perfected  in  the  power 
of  Yoga  shall  one  day  deliver  thee  from  this  curse." 

Having  pronounced  this  curse  on  Rambha,  the  rishi  became 
a  prey  to  remorse,  for,  giving  way  to  wrath  he  lost  the  fruit 
of  all  his  yogic  practices. 

Rambha  having  been  instantly  turned  to  stone,  Indra  and 
Kama,  perceiving  the  sage  filled  with  wrath,  fled  in  terror. 

Shri  Vishwamitra  having  lost  the  merit  of  his  penances  could 
obtain  no  peace ;  his  passions  remaining  unsubdued,  he  resolved 
to  speak  no  word  to  any  and  never  give  way  to  anger ;  he  said : 
"  For  a  thousand  years,  I  will  not  breathe.  Reducing  my  body 
to  the  last  extremity,  mastering  my  senses,  I  will  obtain 
brahmanhood  by  the  power  of  my  penance.  Measureless  years, 
shall  I  remain  standing,  neither  breathing  nor  eating,  even  should 
my  limbs  become  atrophied." 

O  Rama,  Vishwamitra  resolved  to  perform  this  mortification 
for  the  space  of  a  thousand  years. 


CHAPTER    65 

Vishwamitra  performs  another  thousand  years*  austerities 

and  he  acquires  brahmanhood 

After  this  the  great  Rishi  Vishwamitra,  leaving  the  northern 
quarter,  went  eastward  and  engaged  in  a  most  severe  course 
of  austerities.  Observing  silence  for  a  thousand  years,  he 
performed  incomparable  ascetic  practices,  hardly  able  to  be 
accomplished. 

After  a  thousand  years,  his  form  reduced  to  the  semblance 
of  wood,  the  royal  sage,  under  the  greatest  provocation,  was 
not  incited  to  anger.  O  Rama,  when  Vishwamitra  was  persuaded 
that  he  had  conquered  anger,  his  vow  of  a  thousand  years' 
mortification  being  terminated,  he  sat  down  to  eat. 

At  that  time,  Indra  appeared  in  the  guise  of  a  brahmin  and 
123 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

requested  the  food  set  before  the  muni,  upon  which  Vishwamitra, 
believing  him  to  be  a  sage,  gave  him  the  whole  which  he  had 
prepared  for  himself  and  still  observing  the  vow  of  silence, 
uttered  no  word. 

'  The  chief  of  the  sages,  suspending  his  breath  for  a  further 
thousand  years,  continued  his  penance,  then  there  issued  from 
his  head  a  smoke  which  terrified  the  beings  of  the  three  worlds. 
By  the  power  of  his  mortification,  the  devas,  gandharvas,  and 
other  beings  were  deprived  of  their  glory  and  lost  conscious- 
ness. 

In  distress,  they  addressed  Shri  Brahma  saying  :  "  O  Lord, 
by  every  means  in  our  power,  we  have  sought  to  distract  the 
great  sage  from  his  penances  and  provoke  him  to  anger,  but  he 
has  persisted  in  his  practices  and  is  free  from  desire  and  aversion. 
If  thou  dost  not  grant  him  brahmanhood,  verily  the  three  worlds 
will  be  destroyed.  None  can  find  rest  anywhere,  the  seas  are 
drying  up  and  the  mountains  are  riven  by  the  power  of  his 
austerities ;  the  sun  is  deprived  of  its  splendour,  the  earth  is 
agitated  and  the  wind  stirs  not.  O  Lord,  we  cannot  move  him 
from  bis  resolve.  On  account  of  this  peril,  men  like  atheists 
have  given  up  the  performance  of  charitable  deeds.  Nowhere 
is  peace  to  be  found.  O  Divine  Being,  lest  the  mighty 
Vishwamitra,  resplendent  as  fire,  determine  to  destroy  the 
universe,  deign  to  grant  him  his  desire.  As  Time,  in  the  form 
of  fire,  at  the  dissolution  of  the  world,  consumes  the  whole 
universe,  so  also  will  the  Sage  Vishwamitra.  Grant  him, 
therefore,  Indrahood,  if  he  so  desire  it,  for  if  Thou  withhold 
brahmanhood  which  he  has  sought  to  acquire,  then  only  the 
sovereignty  of  Indra's  region,  will  content  him." 

Thus  approached,  Shri  Brahma,  accompanied  by  the  gods, 
appeared  before  Shri  Vishwamitra  and  in  pleasing  accents 
addressed  him,  saying :  "  O  Brahmarishi,  reverence  to  thee, 
we  are  pleased  with  thine  austerity.  O  Holy  Vishwamitra,  by 
the  power  of  thy  penance,  thou  hast  acquired  brahmanhood. 
The  gods  bless  thee,  may  prosperity  attend  thee,  may  longevity 
be  thine  1  From  to-day,  thou  art  free,  now  go  where  thou 
pleaseth." 

Offering  salutations  to  Shri  Brahma  and  all  the  gods,  Shri 
Vishwamitra   said:    "Having   bestowed   brahmanhood  and 
124 


BALA    KANDA 

longevity  upon  me,  grant  me  instruction  in  the  holy  syllable 
'ABM'  and  the  Vedas  also,  and  further  invest  me  with  the 
authority  to  officiate  at  the  sacrifice.  O  Ye  Gods,  let  the  son 
of  Brahma,  Shri  Vasishtha,  fully  acquainted  with  the  Vedic 
science,  acknowledge  me  as  a  brahmarishi.  If  this  desire  of 
mine  be  fulfilled,  ye  may  all  depart." 

Thereupon  the  gods  appeared  before  Shri  Vasishtha,  who 
having  acquiesced  in  their  wish  and  sealed  his  friendship  with 
Vishwamitra,  said  to  him :  "  Verily  thou  art  now  a  brahmarishi 
and  as  such  I  acknowledge  thee."  Thereafter  the  gods  returned 
to  their  own  region.  Thus  did  the  illustrious  Sage  Vishwamitra 
acquire  brahmanhood. 

The  divine  sage  then  paid  homage  to  the  great  Vasishtha  and, 
his  purpose  accomplished,  wandered  about  the  earth  engaged  in 
charitable  deeds.  Shri  Shatananda  said  :  "  O  Rama,  this  is  the 
story  of  Shri  Vishwamitra  and  how  he  obtained  brahmanhood. 
O  Raghava,  verily  he  is  the  chief  of  sages  and  the  personification 
of  Yoga.  Constantly  engaged  in  acts  of  virtue,  he  still  performs 
rigorous  penances." 

Having  uttered  these  words,  Shri  Shatananda  became  silent. 

When  this  excellent  sage  had  ended  his  narrative,  King  Janaka 
in  the  presence  of  Rama  and  Lakshmana  humbly  addressed  Shri 
Vishwamitra  saying :  "  O  Chief  of  Sages,  blessed  am  I,  that 
thou  art  come  with  Shri  Rama  and  Lakshmana  to  my  sacrifice. 
O  Muni,  thou  hast,  by  thy  presence,  done  us  great  honour. 
O  Brahmarishi,  thou  hast  added  to  our  renown.  Shri  Rama, 
my  counsellors  and  I  have  heard  the  story  of  thy  wonderful 
austerities  and  also  of  thine  excellent  qualities.  O  Great  Sage, 
immense  is  thy  power,  unimaginable  thy  penances,  incalculable 
thy  virtues,  nor  does  one  ever  tire  of  hearing  of  thy  marvellous 
deeds.  O  Illustrious  Lord,  the  sun  has  set  and  the  time  of 
evening  devotion  is  near,  graciously  grant  us  leave  to  depart ; 
in  the  morning  we  shall  see  thee  again." 

Shri  Vishwamitra  gratified  by  the  king's  words,  praised  him 
and  granted  him  permission  to  depart,  upon  which  King  Janaka 
rose  and  circumambulating  the  great  sage  took  his  departure, 
accompanied  by  his  spiritual  preceptor  and  relatives. 

Honoured  by  the  sages,  the  great  Vishwamitra  with  Shri  Rama 
and  Lakshmana  also  returned  to  his  abode.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER     66 

King  Janaka  relates  the  story  of  the  great  bow  and  the  birth 
o/Sita 

The  day  dawned  peacefully  and  King  Janaka,  having  performed 
his  morning  devotions,  called  for  the  two  princes  and  Vish- 
wamitra.  Having  honoured  the  sage  and  the  two  descendants 
of  the  House  of  Raghu,  he  said :  "  O  Blessed  Lord,  peace  be 
with  thee,  what  service  can  I  render  thee,  I  am  wholly  thine." 

Thus  addressed  by  the  king,  the  Sage  replied :  "  These  two 
princes  are  the  sons  of  King  Dasaratha,  they  are  renowned  in 
the  warrior  caste  and  exalted  throughout  the  earth.  They  desire 
to  see  the  great  bow,  which  is  deposited  with  thee,  be  gracious 
enough  to  permit  them  to  view  it  and  having  thus  accomplished 
their  purpose,  they  will  return  to  their  own  capital." 

Thus  addressed,  King  Janaka  replied  to  the  sage :  "  O  Holy 
Rishi,  hear  from  me  for  what  reason  this  bow  is  deposited  with 
me.  There  was  a  king  named  Devarata  in  the  sixth  generation 
of  the  monarch  Nimi  who  obtained  this  bow  as  a  trust.  In 
ancient  days,  Shri  Mahadeva  at  the  destruction  of  DakshaV 
sacrifice,  lifting  up  his  bow  in  sport  said  to  the  gods  :  '  O  Devas, 
ye  have  failed  to  give  me  my  share  in  the  sacrifice,  therefore, 
by  means  of  this  bow  I  shall  destroy  you  all.' 

"  O  Great  Sage,  the  devas  overwhelmed  with  fear,  making 
supplication  to  the  god,  succeeded  in  propitiating  Shri  Maha- 
deva. Then  he  delivered  the  bow  to  the  gods  and  they  bestowed 
it  on  King  Devarata.    This  is  the  bow. 

"  Thereafter,  while  I  was  ploughing  the  earth  for  a  sacrifice,  a 
virgin  issued  therefrom.  Being  uncovered  by  the  edge  of  the 
plough,  I  named  her  Sita3  and  she  became  my  daughter.  This 
earth-born  virgin  has  grown  up  under  my  protection.  For 
the  marriage  of  my  daughter,  it  was  established  by  me  and 
made  known  to  the  kings  coming  to  seek  her  hand,  that  I  should 
not  bestow  her  on  any  prince  whose  strength  had  not  been 
fully  tried.    O  Renowned  Sage,  these  kings  have  come  to  test 

1  Daksha — the  father  of  Parvali,  the  ion  of  Brahma,  one  of  the  Prajapstii 
1  Sita — literally  a  furrow. 

126 


BALA    KANDA 

their  prowess  and  I  have  placed  the  bow  before  them  and 
requested  them  to  string  it,  but  none  as  yet  has  been  able  to 
do  so.  Perceiving  them  to  be  deficient  in  strength,  I  have 
refused  to  bestow  my  daughter  on  any  of  them.  These  kings, 
inflamed  with  anger,  considering  their  failure  to  string  the  bow 
had  brought  them  into  disrepute,  surrounded  my  capital,  and 
inflicted  great  hardship  on  my  people.  This  siege  endured  a 
full  year  and  immeasurably  reduced  my  treasury.  Undergoing 
severe  penances,  I  propitiated  the  gods,  who  granted  me  a  large 
army  with  which  I  have  defeated  those  kings  who  have  retreated, 
bereft  of  courage,  yet  still  smarting  under  imagined  injury. 

"  O  Great  Sage,  this  is  that  bow  and  I  will  show  it  to  these 
two  princes.  O  Rishi,  should  Shri  Ramachandra  be  able  to 
string  the  bow,  I  will  give  my  daughter  Sita  to  him  in  marriage." 


chapter   67 

The  illustrious  Rama  breaks  the  bow  and  is  given  the  Princess 
Sita  in  marriage 

Hearing  the  words  of  King  Janaka,  Shri  Vishwamitra  said  :— 

"  O  King,  let  the  bow  be  shown  to  Shri  Rama." 

Then  the  monarch  addressed  his  ministers,  saving :  "  Go, 
bring  the  bow  adorned  with  flowers  and  sandalwood,  hither." 

The  counsellors  commanded  by  Janaka  went  to  the  capital 
and  brought  back  the  bow.  Five  hundred  men,  of  great  strength, 
brought  the  eight-wheeled  cart  on  which  the  bow  was  placed. 
Having  brought  the  chest  fashioned  of  iron  containing  the  bow, 
the  ministers  addressed  their  divine  sovereign,  saying :  "  O 
Chief  of  Men,  here  is  the  bow  worshipped  by  former  kings. 
O  Sovereign  of  Mithila,  it  is  at  thy  disposal." 

Then,  with  palms  joined  in  humility,  King  Janaka  spoke  to 

the  holy  Sage  Vishwamitra  standing  with  Rama  and  Lakshmana : 

"  O  Holy  Lord,  this  is  the  bow  which  has  been  the  object  of 

worship  to  the  kings  of  the  Nimi  dynasty  and  which  the  monarchs 

127  x 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  the  earth  coming  hither  have  sought  to  string.  Even  the  gods 
have  not  been  able  to  raise,  bend  or  string  this  bow.  How, 
therefore,  should  mortals  have  the  power  to  do  so  if  the  gods 
have  failed  ?  O  Great  Rishi,  behold  the  bow,  let  the  two  princes 
examine  it." 

The  righteous  Sage  Vishwamitra,  hearing  the  words  of  the 
king,  said  to  Rama :  "  O  Child,  view  this  divine  bow."  Then 
Shri  Rama,  approaching  the  casket  in  which  the  bow  lay,  opened 
it  and  gazed  upon  it. 

He  said :  "  O  Divine  Lord,  taking  it  in  my  hand  and  raising 
it  up,  I  shall  endeavour  to  string  the  bow."  Then  the  king  and 
the  sage  answered :  "  Be  it  so,"  and  Shri  Ramachandra  with 
a  slight  effort,  seizing  the  centre  of  the  bow,  lifted  it  up  in  the 
presence  of  thousands  of  people  and  without  exertion  drew  it. 
By  the  unparalleled  strength  of  the  illustrious  Rama,  the  bow 
broke  into  two  parts  and  a  sound  resembling  the  fall  of  a 
thunderbolt  rang  forth  cleaving  the  mountains  asunder  and 
causing  the  earth  to  shake,  and  on  this  the  people  on 
every  side  fell  insensible,  save  only  Vishwamitra,  Rama  and 
Lakshmana. 

After  a  while,  the  people  being  somewhat  restored,  and 
the  king's  misgivings  set  at  rest,  he  addressed  the  excellent 
Sage  with  humility,  saying  :  "  O  Blessed  Lord,  I  have  witnessed 
the  unparalleled,  wonderful  and  incontestable  feat  of  Shri 
Ramachandra.  My  daughter,  the  Princess  Sita,  shall  obtain 
Prince  Rama  as  her  lord  and  add  to  the  glory  of  my  dynasty. 
O  Great  Sage,  to-day  my  pledge  to  subject  the  prospective 
wooer  of  my  daughter  to  a  trial  of  strength  has  been  redeemed. 
Now  I  shall  bestow  on  Rama,  Sita,  who  is  dearer  to  me  than 
my  life.  With  thy  permission,  O  Sage,  my  messengers  in  swift 
chariots  shall  drive  in  all  haste  to  Ayodhya  and  respectfully 
relating  this  event  to  King  Dasaratha  invite  him  to  my  capital. 
They  shall  further  inform  him  regarding  the  well-being  of  the 
two  princes  protected  by  thee  and  with  due  honour,  convey 
the  great  king  hither." 

The  Sage  Vishwamitra  acquiescing  to  the  proposal,  the  king 
communicated  the  matter  to  his  messengers  and  entrusting  them 
with  a  personal  missive  to  King  Dasaratha,  sent  them  forth 
on  their  deputation.

CHAPTER    68 

King  Janaka  sends  messengers  to  invite  King  Dasaratka 
to  the  capital 

Commanded  by  King  Janaka,  the  messengers  in  swift  chariots, 
passing  three  nights  on  the  way,  their  horses  greatly  fatigued, 
arrived  at  Ayodhya.  Entering  the  gates  of  the  palace,  they 
addressed  the  sentries,  saying  :— 

"  Please  inform  the  king  that  we  have  come  from  King  Janaka 
and  desire  an  audience." 

King  Dasaratha  being  informed,  caused  the  messengers  to  be 
brought  before  him.  Entering  the  royal  palace,  they  beheld 
the  aged  king  who  resembled  a  god.  His  benign  and  gracious 
presence  putting  them  at  their  ease,  they  addressed  him  in  gentle 
and  submissive  accents  saying :  "  0  Illustrious  Sovereign,  the 
Lord  of  the  kingdom  of  Mithila,  the  performer  of  great  sacrifices, 
King  Janaka,  enquires  with  affection  as  to  thy  well-being  and 
also  concerning  the  welfare  of  thy  subjects.  With  the  consent 
of  the  Sage  Vishwamitra  he  sends  you  the  following  good  tidings. 
His  daughter  who  has  been  wooed  by  many  kings  unable  to 
pass  the  requisite  trial  of  strength,  who  have  thereupon  returned 
home  discomfited,  has  been  won  by  thy  highly  fortunate  and 
princely  son.  He,  in  the  company  of  the  Sage  Vishwamitra, 
coming  hither,  broke  the  sacred  bow  in  the  presence  of  a  great 
assembly,  therefore,  King  Janaka  desiring  to  see  his  daughter 
wedded  to  thy  son,  Shri  Ramachandra,  sends  thee  the  following 
message :  "  O  Great  Sovereign  be  gracious  enough  to  visit  my 
kingdom  with  all  speed,  together  with  thy  preceptors,  thy  family 
and  attendants  and  be  united  with  thy  sons.  Accept  the  love 
I  bear  for  thee.  Do  thou  come  hither  and  witness  the  nuptials 
of  thy  children. 

"  O  King,  these  are  the  words  of  King  Janaka  which  we  bring 
to  thee  approved  by  the  Sage  Vishwamitra  and  the  priest  Shri 
Shatananda." 

Having  uttered  these  words,  the  messengers,  overawed  by 
the  sovereign's  presence,  became  silent. 

On  receiving  these  tidings,  King  Dasaratha  full  of  joy,  said 
129 


THE  RAMAYANA  OF  VALMIKI 

to  the  holy  Sage  Vasishtha,  Shri  Vamadeva  and  his  ministers : 
"  Protected  by  Shri  Vishwamitra,  Shri  Ramachandra  and  Prince 
Lakshmana  are  now  in  the  city  of  Mithila.  The  renowned 
Janaka  has  witnessed  the  prowess  of  Shri  Ramachandra  and 
desires  to  give  his  daughter  in  marriage  to  him.  If  this  union 
is  looked  upon  with  favour  by  you,  let  us  start  for  Mithila 
immediately}  so  that  we  may  reach  it  with  all  speed." 

The  sages  and  ministers  there  present,  answered:  "It  is 
well,"  whereupon  the  king,  highly  pleased,  said:  "Let  us 
set  out  to-morrow." 

King  Dasaratha  with  his  counsellors  entertained  King  Janaka's 
messengers  with  great  respect,  and  they  passed  the  night  there 
in  comfort. 


CHAPTER    69 

King  Dasaratha  sets  out  with  Ms  spiritual  preceptor,  relations 
and  ministers 

The  night  being  over,  King  Dasaratha,  glad  in  heart,  accom- 
panied by  his  spiritual  preceptor  and  relations,  summoned  his 
chief  minister,  Sumantra,  and  said : — 

"  Let  the  officers  of  the  treasury  take  with  them  wealth  and 
jewels  in  abundance  and  precede  us  in  good  order.  Let  the 
four  divisions  of  my  army  hold  themselves  in  readiness  and 
let  chariots  and  palanquins  be  prepared.  Let  my  commands 
be  carried  out  with  promptitude.  Suffer  Shri  Vasishtha, 
Vamadeva,  Javali,  Kashyapa,  Bhrigu,  Markandeya  and  Katya- 
yana  with  other  learned  and  holy  men  to  lead  the  procession. 
Make  ready  the  royal  chariot,  let  there  be  no  delay,  King  Janaka's 
messengers  are  eager  to  return." 

Then  the  mighty  King  Dasaratha  attended  by  the  holy  sages 
set  out  on  the  journey  followed  by  his  army.  Passing  four 
nights  on  the  road,  they  entered  the  capital  of  King  Janaka, 
who,  having  commanded  the  city  to  be  decorated,  advanced 
to  pay  honour  to  his  royal  guests.  Approaching  the  aged 
130 


BALA    KANDA 

sovereign  Dasaratha,  King  Janaka  was  filled  with  joy,  and 
addressed  him  with  cheerful  words,  saying :  *'  O  Great  King, 
I  bid  thee  welcome,  fortunate  indeed  am  I  that  thou  hast  been 
gracious  enough  to  honour  me  with  thy  presence.  Now  shalt 
thou  have  the  felicity  of  looking  on  thy  two  sons.  Twice  blessed 
am  I  that  Shri  Vasishtha,  attended  by  other  learned  sages,  has 
come  hither  also,  as  it  were  Indra  in  the  midst  of  the  gods. 
Every  impediment  to  the  wedding  ceremony  has  been  withdrawn 
and  this  ancient  dynasty,  by  the  alliance  with  the  House  of  Raghu, 
will  acquire  new  lustre.  O  Illustrious  Sovereign,  to-morrow 
at  the  completion  of  the  sacrifice,  having  consulted  with  the 
sages,  be  gracious  enough  to  celebrate  the  nuptials/* 

The  eloquent  monarch,  Dasaratha,  seated  amidst  the  sages, 
answered :  "  I  have  ever  heard  that  those  who  receive  charity 
are  subject  to  the  conferrer  of  that  charity !  O  Thou  acquainted 
with  virtue,  it  is  ours  to  defer  to  thee  in  all  things." 

Hearing  the  speech  of  the  truthful  sovereign,  King  Dasaratha, 
King  Janaka  was  filled  with  astonishment. 

All  the  sages  then  coming  together,  passed  the  night  in 
converse,  mutually  delighting  each  other. 

King  Dasaratha,  being  united  with  his  sons  was  filled  with 
happiness  and  surrendered  himself  wholly  to  King  Janaka's 
hospitality. 

The  magnanimous  sovereign  of  Mithila,  having  completed 
the  orders  for  the  preparations  of  the  wedding  ceremony,  retired

The  king  with  Vishwandtra  and  the  princes  are  invited  to 

King  Janaka's  court  where  Viskwamitra  relates  the  descent 

of  the  dynasty 

The  following  day,  King  Janaka,  having  carried  out  the  sacrifice 
with  the  assistance  of  the  priests,  said  to  Shri  Shatananda : — 

"  My  younger  brother,  the  virtuous  and  mighty  Kushadwaja, 
resides  in  the  city  of  Sankanshya,  which  is  surrounded  by  a  moat 
131 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  battlements,  mounted  by  heavy  batteries,  the  river  Ikshu 
flowing  at  its  side,  and  resembles  the  aerial  chariot  Pushpaka.  I 
desire  to  see  that  Excellent  One,  who,  with  liberality,  has  assisted 
me  in  the  act  of  sacrifice ;  it  is  meet  that  he  should  attend 
the  marriage  ceremony." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Shri  Shatananda,  certain  attendants 
standing  near,  were  commanded  by  the  king  to  set  out  thither. 
At  his  command,  the  messengers,  like  gods  riding  out  on  the 
behest  of  Indra,  went  forth  on  swift  horses  to  bring  back  the 
royal  guest. 

Arriving  at  Sankanshya,  and  being  received  by  the  King 
Kushadwaja,  they  acquainted  him  with  King  Janaka's  proposal. 
The  great  king  acquiescing  to  his  request,  came  to  the  capital 
of  the  sovereign  of  Mithila  and  beholding  the  virtuous  great- 
souled  Janaka,  together  with  Shri  Shatananda,  bowed  down  to 
them  in  salutation. 

Having  occupied  a  royal  seat  in  the  assembly,  the  two 
illustrious  brothers  commanded  their  chief  minister,  Sudamana, 
saying :  "  O  Chief  of  Counsellors,  speedily  approach  the  great 
sovereign,  Dasaratha,  of  limitless  glory,  and  bring  that  Excellent 
One  to  my  court,  together  with  the  two  princes  and  his  ministers." 

Sudamana,  going  to  the  encampment  of  King  Dasaratha,  and 
bowing  down  to  him,  said :  "  O  Great  Hero,  O  Lord  of  Ayodhya, 
the  sovereign  of  Mithila  humbly  invites  thee  with  thy  spiritual 
preceptor,  thy  priests  and  thy  two  sons  to  his  assembly." 

Then  King  Dasaratha  attended  by  his  friends  and  kinsmen 
came  to  the  place  where  King  Janaka  sat  amidst  the  sages  and 
ministers.  And  he,  the  wise  and  eloquent  monarch  addressed 
King  Janaka,  saying :  "  O  Great  King,  it  is  known  to  thee  that 
the  chief  priest  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku  is  Shri  Vasishtha  and 
my  spokesman  in  all  matters.  Therefore,  with  the  approval  of 
Shri  Vishwamitra  he  will  relate  the  descent  of  our  dynasty 
to  thee." 

Having  spoken,  Dasaratha  became  silent  and  Shri  Vasishtha 
then  addressed  King  Janaka  and  Shri  Shatananda  : — 

"  From  Brahman,  the  Unmanifest,  the  Eternal  and  Imperish- 
able Brahma  came  forth.    From  him  was  produced  Maricha, 
Maricha   begot   Kashyapa;    Kashyapa  begot   Surya,    Surya 
132 


BALA    KANDA 

begot  Vivaswat,  and  Vivaswat  begot  Manu.  Manu  was  the 
father  of  Ikswaku  who  was  the  first  king  of  Ayodhya.  The  son 
of  Ikswaku  was  Kukshi  and  his  son  was  Vikukshi ;  the  illustrious 
Vana  was  the  son  of  Vikukshi  and  Vana's  son  was  the  mighty 
Anranya;  his  son  was  Prithu  and  the  son  of  Prithu  was 
Trishanku ;  the  great  Dhundhumara  was  the  son  of  Trishanku 
and  his  son  was  the  hero  Yuvanashwa.  The  renowned  Mand- 
hata  was  born  of  Yuvanashwa  and  Mandhata's  son  was  named 
Susandhi.  Susandhi  had  two  sons  Dhruva-sandhi  and  Prasen- 
ajit.  Bharata  was  the  son  of  Dhruva-sandhi  and  the  renowned 
Asit  was  the  son  of  Bharata.  The  three  sons  of  Asit  were 
Hihasas,  Talajanghas  and  Shashavindus,  great  Kings,  who, 
hostile  to  their  sire,  waged  war  against  him  and  sent  him  into 
exile.  Then  King  Asit,  with  his  two  consorts,  going  to  the 
Himalayas,  there  laid  down  his  life,  leaving  the  queens  pregnant, 
whereat  one  of  them,  to  destroy  the  fruit  of  the  other's  womb, 
gave  her  poison. 

"At  that  time,  a  sage  of  the  family  of  Bhrigu  dwelt  on  the 
heights  of  Himalaya,  by  name  Chyavana  practising  penance 
there.  Then  the  lotus-eyed  Queen  Kalindi,  desirous  of  bearing 
an  excellent  son  approached  the  sage  who  resembled  a  god  and 
bowed  before  him.  The  brahmin  addressed  the  queen  saying : 
'  O  Fortunate  One,  thou  bearest  in  thy  womb,  a  hero,  soon 
to  be  born  together  with  the  poison  ;  have  no  anxiety.' 

"  The  queen,  faithful  to  her  deceased  lord,  overcome  with 
sorrow,  fearing  the  death  of  her  child,  paid  homage  to  the  muni. 
Thereafter  she  bore  a  son,  born  with  the  poison  administered 
by  the  other  wife  and  he  was  named  Sagara. 

"  The  son  of  Sagara  was  Asumanjas,  and  his  son  was 
Anshuman.  The  son  of  Anshuman  was  Dilipa,  and  Dilipa's 
son  was  Bhagiratha.  The  son  of  Bhagiratha  was  Kakustha  and 
bis  son  was  Raghu.  The  son  of  Raghu,  Prabradha  became 
a  demon,  and  was  subsequently  called  Kalamashapada  and  his 
son  was  Shangana.  The  son  of  Shangana  was  Sudarshana,  and 
his  son  was  Agni-varna.  Shighraga  was  the  son  of  Agni-vama 
and  the  son  of  Shighraga  was  Manu.  Manu's  son  was  Prashu- 
shruka  and  his  son  was  Ambarisha.  Ambarisha's  son  was 
named  Nahusha  and  his  son  was  Yayati.  The  son  of  Yayati 
was  Nabhaga. 

*33 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  The  son  of  Nabhaga  was  Aja,  and  the  son  of  Aja  was  King 
Dasaratha ;  the  two  sons  of  King  Dasaratha  are  Rama  and 
Lakshmana. 

"  O  King,  I  have  recounted  the  genealogy  of  King  Ikswaku 
to  thee.  All  these  kings  were  noble,  virtuous  and  distinguished 
in  their  love  of  truth. 

"  King  Dasaratha  requests  the  hands  of  thy  daughters  in 
marriage  for  his  two  sons,  who  are  in  every  way  worthy  to  be 
thy  kinsmen.    O  Chief  of  Men,  bestow  thy  daughters  on  them." 


chapter   71 

King  Janaka  gives  an  account  of  the  succession  and  his  dynasty 

King  Janaka,  paying  homage  to  the  Sage  Vasishtha,  said :  "  O 
Maharishi,  be  peace  with  thee,  hear  the  account  of  the  succession 
of  our  dynasty.  At  the  time  of  bestowing  a  daughter  in 
marriage,  it  is  customary  for  the  father  to  recite  the  pedigree 
of  his  race,  be  gracious  enough  to  hear  me,  O  Lord. 

"  In  ancient  times,  renowned  in  the  three  worlds  was  the 
King  Nimi,  eminent  in  virtue,  a  lover  of  truth  and  foremost 
among  kings  of  that  era.  Nimi  begot  Mithi  whose  son  was 
the  first  Janaka  and  he  begot  Udavasu.  His  sbn  was  Nandi- 
vardhana  and  he  begot  Suketu.  Suketu  begot  the  righteous 
Devarata  and  the  son  of  Devarata  was  the  royal  Sage  Briha- 
dratha.  He  begot  the  great  hero  Mahavirya  whose  son  was 
Dhratiman  and  his  son  was  the  truthful  Sudhriti.  He  begot 
Dhrishta-Ketu  and  his  son  was  the  royal  Sage  Haryashwa. 
Haryashwa  begot  Mam.  Then  followed  Frasidhaka,  Kirtti- 
ratha,  Devamirha,  Bibudha,  Mahidhraka,  Kirtivaja  and  Maha- 
roma.  Maharoma  begot  Swarnaroma  and  bis  son  was  Hraswa- 
roma.  Hraswaroma  had  two  sons  of  whom  I,  myself,  am  the 
elder,  and  this  is  my  younger  brother  Kushadwaja.  My  father, 
bequeathing  the  kingdom  to  me  and  charging  me  with  the  care 
of  Kushadwaja,  retired  to  the  forest.  My  aged  sire,  having 
passed  from  this  world,  I  began  to  rule  according  to  dharma, 
134 


BALA    KANDA 

supporting  my  brother  with  the  utmost  affection.  After  some 
time,  the  King  Sudhanwa  besieged  the  capital  of  Mithila, 
thereafter  he  sent  me  offers  of  peace  on  condition  I  surrendered 
my  daughter,  Sita,  and  also  the  sacred  bow  of  Shiva  to  him. 
O  Brahmarishi,  on  rejecting  his  offer  a  battle  ensued  between 
us  in  which  Sudhanwa  was  slain.  O  Great  Sage,  King  Sud- 
hanwa being  dead,  I  gave  the  kingdom  of  Sankasya  to  my 
well-beloved  brother  Kushadwaja.  This  is  my  well-beloved 
brother.    O  Sages,  we  submit  ourselves  in  love,  to  thee. 

"  O  Raghava,  to  Shri  Ramachandra  I  give  my  daughter  Sita, 
and  Prince  Lakshmana  will  receive  the  Princess  Urmila.  Sita, 
resembling  a  daughter  of  the  gods,  I  bestow  on  Rama ;  verily 
with  my  whole  heart  do  I  yield  these  two  daughters  of  mine 
to  thy  sons.  O  King,  now  be  pleased  to  inaugurate  the 
traditional  distribution  of  kine  in  charity.  Perform  the  Nandi- 
Mukha1  ceremony  so  that  the  nuptials  may  be  celebrated. 

"  To-day  the  Magda  star  is  in  the  ascendant  and  in  three  days 
the  Uttara  Phalguni  will  have  risen ;  the  marriage  should  take 
place  in  that  conjunction. 

"  For  the  purpose  of  ensuring  their  felicity,  let  Rama  and 
Lakshmana  now  distribute  cows,  land,  sesamum  seed  and  other 
requisite  offerings." 


CHAPTER    72 

The  marriage  of  the  four  sons  of  King  Dasaratha  is  arranged 
and  preparations  commence 

King  Jakaka  having  uttered  these  words,  Mahamuni  Vish- 
wamitra,  as  desired  by  Shri  Vasishtha,  said  to  him : — 

"  O  King,  wonderful  indeed  are  the  two  Houses  of  Ikshwaku 
and  Videha,  their  glory  is  limitless,  verily  they  have  no  equal. 
Shri  Rama  and  Sita  are  in  perfect  accord  one  with  the  other, 
as  also  Lakshmana  and  Urmila,  each  equals  the  other  in  grace 
and  heritage.    O  Virtuous  King,  I  have  something  further  to 

1  Nandi-mulcha  ceremony — The  distribution  of  cows  in  charity.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIK1 

say,  hear  me.  Thy  younger  brother,  King  Kushadwaja, 
unexcelled  in  virtue,  has  two  daughters  of  incomparable  beauty, 
these  two  I  request  for  the  sagacious  Bharata  and  the  pious 
Shatrughna.  The  four  sons  of  King  Dasaratha  are  youthful, 
handsome,  resembling  the  gods,  equal  to  the  (four)  guardians 
of  the  world.  O  Great  King,  bestow  these  two  damsels  on  the 
younger  sons  of  King  Dasaratha.  Thou  art  unequalled  in  virtue 
and  the  House  of  Ikswaku  is  without  a  peer." 

Hearing  the  magnanimous  words  of  Shri  Vishwamitra  echoed 
by  Shri  Vasishtha,  King  Janaka  with  joined  palms  humbly 
addressed  the  two  august  sages  :— 

"  O  Holy  Ones,  I  am  proud  that  you  have  approved  the 
alliance  of  my  House  with  the  House  of  Ikshwaku.  Your 
commands  shall  be  accomplished.  The  daughters  of  King 
Kushadwaja  shall  be  given  to  the  Princes  Bharata  and  Shatrughna 
in  marriage.  Let  the  four  great  sons  of  King  Dasaratha  be 
united  with  the  four  princesses  on  the  same  day.  O  Divine 
Sage,  to-morrow  the  constellation  Phalguni  presided  over  by 
the  deity  Bhag'  is  in  the  ascendant.  The  wise  consider  this 
season  as  auspicious  for  the  nuptials." 

Shri  Vasishtha  answering  "  Be  it  so  ",  King  Janaka,  in  great 
humility,  addressed  the  holy  sages,  saying :  "  O  Spiritual  Kings, 
it  is  by  your  favour  that  I  am  able  to  offer  my  daughters  in 
marriage.  Regard  me  as  your  servant.  Ye  are  worthy  of  these 
seats  prepared  for  you.  Let  my  kingdom  now  belong  to  the 
King  Dasaratha  and  my  affections  extend  to  the  kingdom  of 
Ayodhya.  I  have  spoken  truth.  O  Holy  Ones,  do  what  is 
considered  necessary." 

King  Dasaratha  hearing  with  attention  the  words  uttered  by 
King  Janaka  was  pleased  and  replied,  saying :  "  O  Brothers, 
possessing  innumerable  excellent  qualities,  ye  have  honoured 
the  holy  rishis  and  kings  with  abundant  hospitality.  May  you 
be  blessed  !  May  happiness  be  yours !  With  your  leave  I  shall 
now  withdraw  to  my  own  apartments  to  inaugurate  the  prelim- 
inary rites." 

Having  taken  leave  of  the  King  of  Mithila,  Shri  Dasaratha, 
preceded  by  the  holy  sage,  went  away.

The  following  day,  having  fulfilled  the  traditional  rites,  King 
Dasaratha  gave  away  innumerable  cows  in  charity.  On  behalf  of 
each  of  his  sons,  he  bestowed  on  the  brahmins  thousands  of  cows 
whose  horns  were  covered  with  gold,  yielding  rich  milk,  together 
with  their  calves.  With  every  cow  the  king  gave  away  a  metal 
milking  vessel.  On  that  day,  four  hundred  thousand  cows 
were  given  away  by  him.  That  mighty  king  holding  his  sons 
supremely  dear,  gave  incalculable  wealth  in  their  name.  King 
Dasaratha,  performing  these  deeds  of  charity,  surrounded  by 
his  sons,  resembled  Brahma  attended  by  the  Regents  of  the  world.

The  marriage  ceremonies  are  completed 

On  the  day  on  which  King  Dasaratha  distributed  the  cows  in 
charity,  the  great  hero  Yudhajit,  the  son  of  the  King  Kaikeya 
and  the  maternal  uncle  of  Bharata,  also  came  to  Janaka's 
capital. 

Seeing  King  Dasaratha,  he  made  enquiries  as  to  his  welfare 
and  said :  "  O  King,  the  Lord  of  Kaikeya,  through  affection, 
sends  tidings  of  his  well-being  to  thee,  and  seeks  to  know  if  it  be 
well  with  thy  friends.  O  Great  King,  my  father  desired  to  see 
Prince  Bharata,  and  for  this  purpose  I  went  to  Ayodhya.  There, 
hearing  that  thou  hadst  gone  to  Mithila  with  thy  sons,  for  their 
nuptials,  I  came  hither  in  haste  to  see  the  son  of  my  sister."1 

King  Dasaratha  thereupon  duly  honoured  his  kinsman  who 
spent  the  night  happily  in  company  with  the  princes. 

The  following  day,  rising  early,  King  Dasaratha  performing 
his  customary  devotions,  proceeded  to  the  sacrificial  pavilion, 
escorted  by  the  sages. 

At  an  auspicious  hour  in  the  presence  of  Shri  Vasishtha  and 
other  sages,  Shri  Ramachandra  and  his  brothers  adorned  with 
every  ornament  being  present,  the  preliminary  ceremonies  were 
performed.

THE    RAMAYAKA    OF    VALMIKI 

Then  Shri  Vasishtha  addressed  King  Janafca  saying :  "  O 
King,  King  Dasaratha  has  inaugurated  the  preliminary  cere- 
monies, he  now  awaits  thy  pleasure.  The  sacred  rite  is  com- 
pleted when  host  and  guests  come  together.  Be  pleased, 
therefore,  to  perform  the  principal  nuptial  rites." 

King  Janaka  listened  to  the  words  of  the  great-souled  Vasishtha 
and  answered :  "  What  guard  detains  King  Dasaratha  at  the 
gate  ?  Whose  sanction  does  his  royal  majesty  seek  ?  Is  not 
this  his  house  ?  Let  the  king  enter !  O  Chief  of  Sages,  my 
daughters,  in  readiness,  stand  at  the  altar,  bright  as  the  clear 
flame.  I,  standing  near,  await  you  all.  There  is  no  need  for 
delay.  Let  the  king  cause  the  ceremony  to  take  place  without 
further  hindrance." 

Then  King  Dasaratha  with  his  sons  and  the  holy  sages  entered 
the  marriage  pavilion.  Thereafter,  King  Janaka  addressed  Shri 
Vasishtha,  saying :  "  O  Virtuous  Sage,  with  the  other  sages 
perform  the  wedding  ceremony." 

Then  Shri  Vasishtha  ignited  the  sacrificial  fire  in  the  centre 
of  the  pavilion.  Shri  Vishwamitra  and  Shri  Shatananda  standing 
before  him,  sprinkled  the  altar  with  perfume,  and  decorated 
it  with  flowers.  Then  he  set  out  the  golden  vessels  and  the 
sacred  kusha  grass,  filling  many  pots  with  incense  and  arranging 
them  in  the  form  of  a  conchshell.  Dishes  filled  with  parched 
corn  and  rice  were  placed  there,  and  durbha  grass  spread  about, 
the  sacred  formulas  being  pronounced  over  them.  The  holy 
rishis  now  lit  a  fire  pronouncing  the  Vedic  mantrams  and  offered 
oblations  into  it 

Shri  Sita,  adorned  with  jewels,  took  her  seat  by  the  sacred  fire 
opposite  Shri  Ramachandra.  King  Janaka,  addressing  the  Son 
of  Raghu,  said  :  "  O  Rama,  from  to-day  my  daughter  Sita  will 
be  thy  companion  in  virtue.  Accept  her,  O  Prince,  and  take 
her  hand  in  thine.  This  fortunate  princess,  faithful  and  tender, 
will  constantly  attend  thee,  following  thee  like  a  shadow,  in 
loving  obedience.    May  you  both  be  happy." 

Saying  this,  King  Janaka  sprinkled  on  them  water  purified 
by  mantrams.    Then  all  the  gods  cried, "  Jai  1  Jai !  M1  and  divine 
music  sounded,  while  a  shower  of  flowers  fell  from  the  skies. 
Thus  was  Sita  joined  in  marriage  to  Shri  Ramachandra. 

i  Jai  t  Jai  !— literally  Victory  1  Victory  !

Then  King  Janaka  said  to  Shri  Lakshmana :  '*  O  Lakshmana, 
come  hither,  peace  be  with  thee  I  Take  in  thy  hand  the  hand 
of  my  daughter  Urmila,  terry  not,  O  Prince." 

Having  thus  spoken,  Janaka  likewise  addressed  Prince 
Bharata,  saying :  "  O  Son  of  Raghu,  accept  the  hand  of  the 
Princess  Mandavi "  and  to  Prince  Shatrughna,  he  said :  "  O 
Great  Prince,  accept  the  hand  of  Shruta-kirtti.  O  Princes  of 
the  House  of  Raghu,  be  gentle  and  faithful  to  your  wives  as 
they  will  be  to  you,  receive  them  now,  let  there  be  no  delay." 

Thus  instructed  by  King  Janaka,  the  four  princes,  taking  the 
hands  of  the  four  princesses  as  directed  by  the  Sage  Vasishtha, 
circumambulated  the  fire,  King  Janaka  and  the  sages  performing 
the  rites  as  ordained  by  the  sacred  ordinance. 

As  the  nuptial  ceremony  of  the  four  princes  of  the  House 
of  Raghu  with  the  four  princesses  terminated,  a  rain  of  Sowers 
fell  on  them  from  the  sky.  Divine  music  sounded,  nymphs 
danced  and  the  celestial  singers  broke  into  paeons  of  praise.  All 
these  marvellous  events  marked  the  wedding  of  the  sons  of 
King  Dasaratha  while  the  princes,  circumambulating  the  fire, 
were  united  with  their  brides. 

Thereafter  with  their  wives,  they  returned  to  their  apartments 
and  King  Janaka  with  his  relatives  and  friends,  with  a  joyful  heart 
having  taken  part  in  the  festivities,  also  withdrew.

The  night  being  past,  the  great  Sage  Vishwamitra  took  leave  of 
King  Dasaratha  and  King  Janaka  and,  blessing  the  princes  and 
their  sire,  departed  for  the  Himalayas  to  meditate  there.  The 
holy  rishi  being  gone,  King  Dasaratha  begged  the  permission 
of  the  Lord  of  Mithila  to  return  to  his  capital.  Bidding  farewell 
to  the  pious  king,  Janaka  escorted  him  for  some  distance  on 
his  way. 
To  the  King  of  Ayodhya,  on  behalf  of  his  daughter,  King 
139 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Janaka  gave  a  hundred  thousand  cows,  woollen  cloths,  countless 
silken  robes  and  richly  decorated  elephants,  horses  and  chariots. 
He  also  bestowed  on  him  male  and  female  attendants,  numberless 
golden  coins  with  quantities  of  pearls  and  coral.  All  these  and 
many  other  gifts  King  Janaka  gave  with  a  joyful  mind,  and 
having  taken  leave  of  King  Dasaratha,  returned  to  Mithila, 
whereupon  King  Dasaratha  with  his  illustrious  sons,  preceded 
by  the  sages,  started  on  the  homeward  journey,  accompanied 
by  his  army. 

As  the  sages,  with  Shri  Ramachandra,  advanced  in  company 
with  the  king,  the  screeching  of  strange  and  terrible  birds  was 
heard,  while  frightened  deer  fled  across  their  path. 

Perceiving  these  inauspicious  signs,  the  king  addressed  Shri 
Vasishtha,  saying :  "  O  Holy  Guru,  why  do  the  birds  cry  thus 
ominously,  and  the  deer  traverse  our  path  ?  What  do  these 
omens  portend  ?  My  mind  is  filled  with  anxiety,  O  Divine 
Lord." 

The  Maharishi  Vasishtha,  in  gentle  tones,  replied :  "  O  King, 
the  fearful  crying  of  the  birds  betokens  some  great  danger,  but 
the  crossing  of  the  deer  from  left  to  right  indicates  a  speedy  end 
to  thy  fears." 

While  they  were  yet  speaking,  the  earth  began  to  quake  and 
and  giant  trees  fell  down,  darkness  covered  the  earth  and  clouds 
of  dust  veiled  the  sun,  nor  could  the  cardinal  points  be  discerned. 
In  the  great  dust  storm  that  followed,  the  army  was  overwhelmed 
with  terror  and  all  became  paralysed,  save  Shri  Vasishtha,  King 
Dasaratha  and  the  princes  alone. 

When  the  dust  was  allayed  and  the  army  somewhat  recovered, 
Shri  Vasishtha  beheld  the  son  of  Yamadagni  of  dreadful  aspect. 
With  matted  hair,  Farasurama,  the  humbler  of  the  pride  of  kings 
and  emperors,  drew  near. 

The  appearance  of  the  muni  resembling  the  splendour  of 
Mount  Kailasha  or  the  fires  of  dissolution  at  the  end  of  the 
world-period  was  hardly  to  be  borne  by  human  eyes.  With  his 
battle  axe  on  his  shoulder,  bearing  a  mighty  bow,  brilliant  as 
lightning,  he  appeared  like  Shiva  about  to  strike  down  Tripura.1 

Beholding  Farasurama  resembling  a  blazing  fire,  the  sages 
reflected  among  themselves  and  said :  "  His  father  being  slain, 

1  Tripura — the  name  of  a  demon  slain  by  Shiva, 
140 


BALA    KANDA 

has  Parasurama  come  again  to  destroy  the  warrior  caste  ? " 
Was  not  his  anger  appeased  when  he  formerly  destroyed  the 
whole  warrior  caste  ?  Has  he  come  again  to  take  his  revenge 
on  us  ?  " 

Reflecting  thus,  they  approached  Parasurama  with  traditional 
offerings,  saying :  "  O  Rama,  accept  this  arghya." 

Shri  Parasurama  accepting  the  offering,  then  addressed  Shri 
Rama. 


chapter    75 

He  challenges  Rama  to  combat 

"  O  Rama,  O  Illustrious  Hero,  I  have  heard  of  thy  great  prowess. 
I  have  also  been  acquainted  with  thy  heroic  deed,  the  breaking 
of  the  bow  at  Janakapura,  verily  a  feat  exciting  wonder  and 
surpassing  imagination.  Having  heard  of  thine  achievement, 
I,  taking  this  other  bow,  have  come  hither.  With  this  terrible 
bow  named  Yamadagni,  show  thy  strength,  O  Rama,  and  placing 
an  arrow  in  it,  discharge  it.  Should'st  thou  be  able  to 
accomplish  this,  I  will  engage  in  honourable  combat  with  thee." 

Hearing  these  words,  King  Dasaratha,  became  dejected  and 
humbly  addressed  the  rishi,  saying :  "  O  Holy  Parasurama, 
thou  art  a  great  brahmin  sage,  it  becomes  thee  not  to  show  anger 
to  warriors ;  be  gracious  unto  my  son,  who  is  still  a  child. 
Thou  art  born  in  the  family  of  Bhrigu  and  hast  pledged  thyself 
to  Indra  to  bear  arms  no  more.  Having  given  the  dominion 
of  the  world  to  Kashyapa  and  retired  to  the  Mahendra  mountain 
to  practise  asceticism,  why  hast  thou  now  come  hither  to  destroy 
us  ?    0  Sage,  if  Rama  is  slain,  none  of  us  will  survive." 

The  great  son  of  Jamadagni,  disregarding  the  entreaty  of  King 
Dasaratha,  again  addressed  Rama,  saying :  "  O  Rama,  these 
two  bows  of  exquisite  design,  famed  throughout  the  world, 
exceedingly  powerful,  were  forged  by  Vishwakarma.1  One  of 
them,  wielded  by  Shri  Shiva  in  combat  with  Tripura,  was  broken 
by  thee.    The  other,  held  by  me,  of  inexpressible  power,  was 

'  Vishwakarma — the  architect  of  the  gods. 

141 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

given  to  Vishnu  by  the  gods  and  is  known  to  give  victory  over 
the  foe  j  it  is  equal  in  moment  to  that  which  thou  hast  broken. 

"  Formerly  the  gods  asked  Brahma  which  of  the  two  excelled 
the  other  and  Shri  Brahma,  acquainted  with  their  intention, 
invoked  a  quarrel  between  Vishnu  and  Mahadeva.  They 
entered  into  combat  one  with  the  other.  By  the  shout  raised 
by  Shri  Vishnu,  Shri  Mahadeva  was  struck  motionless  and 
his  bow  unstrung.  Then  the  gods  and  rishis  came  to  that  place 
and  caused  the  two  gods  to  be  reconciled.  Thereafter  the  gods 
esteemed  the  bow  of  Vishnu  to  be  the  more  powerful  and  Shri 
Shiva  surrendered  his  bow  to  the  King  of  Mithila,  together 
with  all  its  arrows. 

"  This  bow,  belonging  to  Vishnu,  was  given  in  ancient  times 
by  that  god  to  Richika  and  he  gave  it  to  his  son  Jamadagni, 
my  rather.  He  having  renounced  the  bearing  of  weapons, 
retired  to  practise  austerity,  when  the  rash  and  foolish  monarch 
Sahasravaku  slew  him.  Hearing  of  the  cruel  death  of  my  sire, 
I  successively  destroyed  the  warrior  caste,  from  generation 
to  generation,  thus  acquiring  dominion  over  the  earth.  I 
conferred  this  great  dominion  as  a  gift  on  the  Sage  Kashyapa 
at  the  completion  of  a  sacrifice,  and  retired  to  the  Mahendra 
mountain,  cheerfully  observing  the  practice  of  Yoga.     To-day, 

0  Valiant  Prince,  acquainted  with  thy  great  achievement,  I 
have  come  hither  to  behold  thee.  Receive  this  bow,  bestowed 
on  my  ancestors  by  Shri  Vishnu  and  in  the  spirit  of  a  warrior, 
place  an  arrow  on  it.     If  thou  succeed  in  drawing  the  bow, 

1  will  challenge  thee  to  fight." 


CHAPTER    76 

Parasurama  is  vanquished  and  deprived  of  his  glory  and  power 

Hearing  these  words,  Shri  Rama  having  regard  for  the  presence 
of  his  sire,  answered  with  restraint,  saying :  "  O  Parasurama, 
thy  deeds  are  known  to  me,  as  also  the  avenging  of  thy  fathers9 
murderers.  Methinks  thou  dost  deem  me  lacking  in  valour, 
142 


BALA    KANDA 

1}  a  kshatriya,  and  a  descendant  of  the  Solar  race.  O  Rishi, 
witness  my  prowess.*' 

Having  spoken  thus,  Shri  Ramachandra,  incensed,  seized  the 
bow  and  arrows  from  the  rishi's  hands  and  stringing  it,  placed 
an  arrow  on  it.  While  drawing  the  mighty  bow,  the  son  of 
Dasaratha  addressed  the  rishi  with  defiance,  saying :  "  O  Sage, 
thou  art  a  brahmin  and  as  such  do  I  honour  thee ;  thou  art 
further  a  kinsman  of  Shri  Vishwamitra,  therefore  I  shall  not 
slay  thee  with  this  arrow,  but  by  this  shaft  I  will  rob  thee  of 
the  power  of  motion  so  that  thou  shalt  no  longer  be  able  to  travel 
through  space,  or  I  will  banish  thee  from  those  high  regions 
to  which  thou  hast  attained  by  the  practice  of  penance.  Say, 
what  is  thy  desire  ?  This  divine  arrow  of  Vishnu,  possessing 
the  power  of  vanquishing  the  strength  and  pride  of  the  foe, 
may  not  be  restored  by  me  to  the  quiver,  till  it  has  accomplished 
its  great  purpose." 

When  Rama  placed  the  arrow  in  the  sacred  bow,  Brahma, 
with  the  gods,  assembled  to  behold  that  glorious  deed,  followed 
by  the  gandharvas,  apsaras,  yakshas  and  other  beings.  Shri 
Ramachandra,  having  taken  up  the  mighty  bow,  the  three  worlds 
began  to  tremble  and  Parasurama,  bereft  of  his  divine  power, 
stood  aghast.  Deprived  of  his  glory  and  powerless,  Shri 
Parasurama  with  humble  entreaty,  addressed  the  lotus-eyed 
Rama:— 

"  When  the  dominion  of  the  earth  was  given  by  me  to  the 
sage  Kashyapa,  he  said  '  Thou  must  not  inhabit  this  kingdom  '. 
Therefore,  O  Rama,  in  obedience  to  the  sage,  I  do  not  stay 
on  the  earth  by  night.  This  world  is  no  longer  mine,  but 
belongs  to  Kashyapa.  O  Rama,  do  not  deprive  me  of  the  power 
of  movement,  but  allow  me  speedily  to  return  to  the  beautiful 
Mahendra  mountain.  Thou  can'st  deprive  me  of  the  merits 
earned  by  the  practice  of  Yoga.  I  know  Thee  to  be  the 
Imperishable,  Thou  art  verily  Vishnu  Himself,  none  but  Thou 
could'st  wield  this  bow.  O  Son  of  Raghu,  the  gods  have 
assembled  to  behold  Thee ;  Thou  art  pre-eminent  in  combat, 
and  the  conqueror  of  Thine  enemies.  O  Virtuous  Prince,  to  be 
defeated  by  Thee  is  no  ignominy ;  discharge  Thy  matchless 
arrow  and  I  will  return  to  the  Mahendra  mountain." 

143  L 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Thereupon  Shri  Ramachandra  discharged  the  arrow  and  the 
merit  of  Parasurama  was  rendered  void,  whereupon  he  speedily 
departed  to  the  Mahendra  mountain. 

The  darkness  being  dispelled  and  the  whole  world  once  more 
filled  with  light,  Rama  was  worshipped  by  the  gods  and  rishis, 
and  Shri  Parasurama  having  circumambulated  the  son  of 
Dasaratha,  returned  to  his  own  hermitage. 


CHAPTER    77 

King  Dasaratha  with  his  army,  the  princes  and  their  brides, 
return  to  Ayodhya 

Shri  Parasurama  having  departed,  Shri  Rama  delivered  the  bow 
and  arrows  as  a  trust  to  the  god  Varuna.  Having  offered 
salutations  to  Shri  Vasishtha  and  the  other  sages  he,  seeing  his 
father  filled  with  apprehension,  addressed  him,  saying :  "  Sire, 
Shri  Parasurama  has  now  gone,  do  thou  command  thine  army 
to  proceed  towards  Ayodhya.'* 

King  Dasaratha,  hearing  Rama's  words,  embraced  him  and 
reflected  that  his  son  was  born  to  him  a  second  time.  Then 
summoning  his  army  to  advance,  he  in  a  chariot,  adorned  with 
banners,  to  the  fanfare  of  trumpets  proclaiming  victory,  entered 
Ayodhya. 

The  streets  of  the  city  sprinkled  with  water  and  flowers, 
appeared  beautiful,  and  the  citizens  rejoicing  at  the  return  of 
their  sovereign,  greeted  him  with  shouts  of  welcome. 

Met  by  the  brahmins  inhabiting  the  city,  the  king  with  his 
friends  and  relatives,  followed  by  the  princes  and  their  brides, 
entered  the  royal  palace  which  was  white  as  snow. 

There,  the  kindred  of  the  king  welcomed  him  with  garlands 
and  sandalwood.  The  Queens  Kaushalya,  Sumitra  and  Kaikeyi 
received  the  brides  and  conducted  the  fortunate  Sita,  the 
illustrious  Urmila,  and  the  two  daughters  of  Kushadwaj  to  their 
palace,  with  auspicious  rites.  Arrayed  in  sumptuous  silken 
robes,  and  borne  to  the  temple  to  worship  the  holy  images,  the 
144 


BALA    KANDA 

brides  then  offered  respectful  salutations  to  their  mother-in-laws, 
and  others  worthy  of  honour.  Thereafter,  each  began  to  live 
with  her  lord  in  her  own  palace. 

Shri  Ramachandra  with  the  other  princes,  possessing  the 
knowledge  of  the  use  of  weapons  and  the  science  of  defence, 
passed  the  time  with  their  friends  in  attendance  on  their  aged 
sire. 

After  some  time,  King  Dasaratha  said  to  his  son  Bharata : 
"  O  my  Son,  thy  maternal  uncle,  who  came  for  the  purpose 
of  taking  thee  to  his  home,  still  tarries  in  the  capital,  therefore, 
go  with  him  to  see  thy  grandfather." 

Prince  Bharata  and  Prince  Shatrughna  prepared  to  start  on 
their  journey  and  took  leave  of  their  father  and  their  highly 
compassionate  brother  Rama. 

Bharata  being  gone,  Shri  Rama  and  Lakshmana  ministered 
to  the  aged  king  as  if  he  were  a  god  and  in  his  name  performed 
charitable  deeds  among  the  people  of  the  city. 

Rama  also  ministered  to  his  mother  with  deep  affection,  and 
served  his  Guru  with  single-minded  devotion.  His  noble 
behaviour  gratified  the  king,  the  brahmins,  merchants  and  other 
castes ;  his  sweet  disposition  and  pious  conduct  charmed  the 
people  of  the  capital.  Rama,  wholly  devoted  to  truth  was 
renowned  for  his  virtue,  and  endowed  with  every  excellent 
quality  like  Swayambhu1-Brahma  himself. 

For  a  long  time  did  Shri  Rama  enjoy  a  life  of  content  with 
Sita.  To  him,  she  was  dear  beyond  all  things  and  he 
surrendered  his  whole  heart  to  her.  Love  is  enhanced  by 
beauty,  virtue  and  gentleness,  and  Sita  possessed  all  these  in 
an  equal  degree  with  Rama.  Lovely  as  a  goddess,  Shri  Sita 
was  able  to  discern  the  thoughts  of  her  lord  before  he  expressed 
them.  The  beautiful  Sita  with  Shri  Ramachandra  wholly 
satisfied,  resembled  Lakshmi,  the  consort  of  the  incomparable 
Vishnu.

CHAPTER    X 

King  Dasaratha  desires  to  see  Prince  Rama  made  regent, 
and  summons  a  council 

THE  great  souled  Bharata  affectionately  requested  the  pious 
Shatrughna  to  accompany  him,  on  the  journey  to  bis  maternal 
grandfather. 

Enjoying  abundant  hospitality  and  held  by  their  uncle 
Ashwapati  in  all  affection,  the  two  brothers  dwelt  there  happily. 
Satisfied  with  the  love  and  entertainment  bestowed  on  them, 
they  daily  remembered  their  royal  sire,  the  aged  monarch,  and 
the  king  also  thought  of  his  sons,  now  in  a  distant  country. 

The  four  sons  of  the  aged  king  were  as  dear  to  him  as  his 
own  four  arms  issuing  from  his  body,  yet  Rama  resembling 
Brahma,  endowed  with  every  good  attribute,  was  dearest  to 
his  sire.  Shri  Rama,  the  eternal  Purusha,1  the  Lord  Vishnu 
himself,  descended  on  earth  on  the  entreaty  of  the  gods,  to 
slay  Ravana,  the  enemy  of  the  whole  world. 

The  charming  Queen  Kaushalya,  glowing  with  maternal  love 
for  her  son  Ramachandra,  resembled  Aditi  at  the  birth  of  Indra. 

Unequalled  in  beauty,  brave  and  chivalrous,  never  speaking 
ill  of  others,  Rama  inherited  the  virtues  of  his  illustrious  father ; 
of  a  cheerful  disposition,  speaking  soft  words  to  all,  never 
returning  a  harsh  answer  when  treated  with  contumely ;  when 
injured,  pardoning  the1  offender  and  remembering  the  offence 
no  more ;  showing  gratitude  for  the  least  of  favours  and 
devoting  his  leisure  from  affairs  of  state  to  seeking  the  friendship 
of  those  eminent  in  wisdom,  learning,  age  and  conduct.  Wise 
and  generous,  he  was  foremost  in  addressing  others,  speaking 
with  affection ;  supremely  courageous  yet  not  rendered  vain- 
glorious by  his  own  powers  ;  never  uttering  falsehood,  honouring 
the  learned  and  the  aged,  showing  regard  for  his  people  who

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

were  devoted  to  him ;  having  overcome  wrath ;  surpassingly 
compassionate,  venerating  the  brahmins ;  showing  extreme  pity 
for  the  poor ;  well-versed  in  public  and  individual  responsibili- 
ties, fulfilling  his  domestic  duties,  not  only  to  add  lustre  to  the 
dynasty  but  also  to  attain  an  exalted  state  in  the  other  world. 
Wise  in  the  discharge  of  his  obligations;  as  a  Scion  of  the  House 
of  Ikshwaku,  proving  himself  tender  and  loving  to  those 
who  sought  his  protection;  restraining  the  evil-doer;  ever 
seeking  the  weal  of  his  subjects ;  eschewing  frivolous  pursuits 
and  shallow  talk ;  neither  hearing  nor  speaking  aught  against 
dharma ;  in  debate  equal  in  eloquence  to  Brihaspati ;  free  from 
infirmities ;  youthful,  handsome,  having  knowledge  of  time 
and  space  and  being  able  to  divine  the  contents  of  a  man's  heart 
at  a  single  glance ;  verily  a  great  sage  and  for  his  marvellous 
qualities  as  dear  to  the  people  as  life  itself.  Profoundly  learned 
in  the  science  and  the  philosophy  of  the  Veda,  which  he  had 
studied  with  his  spiritual  preceptor,  he  even  excelled  his  father  in 
the  art  of  warfare.  The  repository  of  all  auspiciousness,  virtuous, 
cheerful,  truthful  and  guileless  ;  having  received  full  instruction 
from  the  learned  brahmins  in  sacred  and  secular  policy,  knowing 
the  significance  of  virtue,  material  prosperity  and  enjoyment ; 
of  prodigious  memory,  conversant  with  worldly  wisdom, 
possessing  a  pleasing  disposition,  gentle,  able  to  conceal  his 
thoughts ;  recognizing  when  to  refuse  and  when  to  accept 
material  gifts ;  winning  many  friends,  firm  in  his  devotion  to 
his  Guru  and  to  God,  countenancing  no  sin ;  never  uttering  a 
bitter  word  or  one  which  would  agitate  the  hearts  of  others ; 
energetic,  deploring  his  own  faults  whilst  excusing  those  of 
others ;  a  great  advocate,  grateful,  lending  support  to  those 
he  held  in  affection ;  in  all  circumstances  true  to  his  word ; 
capable  of  protecting  the  interests  of  his  family  and  friends ; 
knowing  how  to  meet  out  retribution  to  the  wicked.  Acquiring 
wealth  by  just  means,  and  appreciating  how  to  distribute  it  with 
discrimination.  Proficient  in  the  Veda,  following  the  literary 
and  dramatic  arts  with  enthusiasm,  endowed  with  the  gift  of 
oratory  in  Sanskrita  and  his  own  native  tongue ;  depending  on 
right  alone  for  felicity  and  prosperity ;  prudent,  accomplished 
in  sport,  music  and  painting ;  an  incomparable  rider  whether 
mounted  on  horse  or  elephant ;  skilled  in  archery,  renowned 
150 


AYODHYA    KAHDA 

in  the  field,  forestalling  the  enemy  in  attack  and  knowing  how 
to  destroy  his  defences;  fired  with  righteous  wrath  when 
engaging  in  combat,  so  that  neither  god  nor  titan  could  withstand 
him ;  speaking  nought  against  any ;  free  from  pride  and  envy ; 
ever  submissive,  yet  overruled  in  his  resolve  by  none ;  pre- 
eminent among  his  people;  renowned  in  the  three  worlds; 
in  forbearance  resembling  the  earth,  in  wisdom  equal  to  Brihas- 
pati,  in  courage  like  unto  Indra. 

Sinning  resplendent  like  the  full  moon  in  the  love  of  his 
people  and  his  sire,  worshipped  for  his  excellent  qualities,  his 
matchless  valour  and  his  integrity,  the  earth  desired  to  make 
him  her  lord. 

Seeing  his  illustrious  son  manifesting  these  qualities,  King 
Dasaratha  began  to  reflect  in  this  wise :  "  I  have  become  old 
and  have  ruled  a  full  measure  of  years.  I  desire  to  see  Rama 
crowned  while  I  yet  live !  " 

This  inclination  grew  in  the  mind  of  the  king,  and  he  waited 
eagerly  for  the  time  when  he  might  resign  his  throne  in  favour 
of  Rama.  He  reflected  :  "  Rama,  resembling  a  cloud,  raining 
compassion  on  all ;  beloved  far  beyond  myself;  in  valour  equal 
to  Yama  and  Indra,  in  understanding  like  Brihaspati,  in 
endurance  like  unto  a  mountain,  exceeding  myself  in  excellent 
attributes  ;  on  him  do  I  desire  to  confer  the  dominion  of  the 
earth ;  this  will  be  my  heaven." 

Then  that  great  sovereign  summoning  his  ministers  communi- 
cated to  them  his  resolve  to  proclaim  Rama,  endowed  with  those 
powers,  rare  even  in  a  king,  and  a  mine  of  surpassing  virtues, 
as  heir-apparent. 

At  that  tune,  inauspicious  portents  appeared  on  the  earth, 
and  in  the  heavens,  and  the  king,  conscious  that  he  had  grown 
old,  reflected  that  by  bestowing  the  throne  on  Rama,  he  would 
gratify  his  comely  son,  and  also  assuage  his  own  sorrow  and 
benefit  his  people.  Filled  with  affection  for  his  subjects,  and 
for  their  good,  he  desired  to  increase  their  felicity  by  installing 
Rama  as  heir-apparent,  when  the  hour  was  auspicious. 

Summoning  the  subject  princes  and  the  inhabitants  of  other 

cities  and  lands  with  due  respect,  the  aged  monarch  entertained 

them  in  his  palaces,  bestowing  on  them  gifts  of  various  kinds, 

but  the  sovereign  of  Kaikeya  and  the  king  of  Mithila  were  not 

151 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

informed  of  the  occasion  since  they  would  hear  of  it  thereafter. 
Seated  in  the  assembly,  the  king  resembled  Prajapati  in  the 
midst  of  his  subjects. 

The  kings  of  the  earth  coming  together  in  council.  King 
Dasaratha  occupying  the  throne  and  they  taking  the  places 
prepared  for  them,  reverently  faced  the  royal  dais,  observing 
the  traditions  of  the  court.  Surrounded  by  his  feudal  lords 
and  the  elders,  the  king  appeared  like  Indra  sitting  among  the 
gods. 


CHAPTER     2 

The  elders  and  councillors  willingly  accept  Shri  Rama  as  regent 

In  ringing  tones,  King  Dasaratha  addressed  the  leaders  of 

the  people  seated  before  him,  uttering  words  delighting  their 
hearts. 

When  the  aged  monarch  began  to  speak,  his  words  resembled 
the  beat  of  drums,  or  the  crashing  of  thunder,  yet  they  were 
rilled  with  great  sweetness  withal  and  uttered  in  the  manner  of 
a  king.  He  said :  "  It  is  well  known  to  you  that  this  vast 
empire  was  upheld  by  my  predecessors  and  their  fathers  before 
them.  To  promote  the  prosperity  and  felicity  of  the  kingdom, 
formerly  protected  by  the  Kings  of  Ikshwaku,  I,  walking  in  the 
path  trodden  by  my  forbears,  have  preserved  it  to  the  utmost. 
Having  passed  sixty  thousand  years  under  the  royal  canopy, 
my  body  has  become  old  and  feeble  and  seeks  repose.  The 
burdens  of  state,  not  able  to  be  sustained  by  those  of  uncontrolled 
mind,  have  I  borne,  and  now  am  weary.  To-day,  therefore, 
with  the  approval  of  the  learned  brahmins  present  here  and  for 
the  good  of  my  people,  I  desire  to  surrender  the  dominion  to 
the  protection  of  my  eldest  son.  Possessing  every  essential 
virtue,  Shri  Ramachandra,  my  beloved  son,  equal  to  Indra  in

AYODHYA    KANDA 

"  I  desire  to  install  as  regent,2  Rama,  exalted  among  men, 
elder  brother  of  Lakshmana,  worthy  to  be  your  protector.  In 
truth,  I  verily  believe  that  not  only  the  earth,  but  the  three 
worlds  will  regard  him  as  their  lord.  Desiring  the  joy  of  the 
universe,  I  shall  lay  upon  him  the  weight  of  government  and 
thus  be  freed  from  anxiety  concerning  the  kingdom. 

"  If  this  seems  proper  to  you,  give  me  your  counsel  or  say 
what  should  otherwise  be  done.  Though  this  be  my  decree, 
yet  should  you  judge  aught  else  to  be  a  better  way,  then  speak 
that  I  may  know  of  it.  The  best  course  is  well  known  to  be 
determined  after  careful  deliberation.'* 

Hearing  the  words  of  King  Dasaratha,  the  other  monarchs 
and  elders  cried  in  unison, "  Excellent,  Excellent ! "  Upon  this, 
a  sound  like  distant  thunder,  pleasant  to  hear,  or  like  the  cry 
of  peacocks  delighting  in  the  storm,  arose.  Thereafter,  the 
purpose  of  the  sovereign  being  communicated  to  all,  acclamations 
burst  forth  that  shook  the  foundations  of  the  palace. 

Then  the  learned  brahmins,  the  ministers,  kings  and  the  elders 
of  the  city  assembled  for  consultation  with  those  who  had  come 
from  afar,  and  being  of  one  mind,  after  due  deliberation,  thus 
addressed  the  king : — 

"  O  Mighty  Sovereign,  thou  hast  ruled  for  thousands  of  years 
and  have  now  become  old,  do  thou,  therefore,  appoint  Rama 
as  regent.  It  is  our  cherished  desire  that  the  glorious  Prince 
Rama  should  be  seen  by  us,  riding  on  an  elephant  beneath 
the  royal  canopy.** 

The  king,  wishing  to  fathom  their  true  motives,  replied  with 
candour,  saying:  "Acting  on  my  suggestion,  you  have  all 
expressed  your  willingness  to  see  Rama  appointed  regent,  yet 
there  is  still  some  uncertainty  in  my  mind ;  tell  me  frankly 
why  you  desire  to  see  Rama  crowned.  Have  I  erred  ?  Have  I 
failed  to  govern  righteously  ?  " 

Then  the  elders  of  the  people  and  the  counsellors  answered 
the  sagacious  sovereign  Dasaratha  in  this  wise :  "  O  King,  thy 
son  is  endowed  with  excellent  attributes.  Hear  of  the  divine 
and  amiable  qualities  of  the  wise  and  perfect  Ramachandra, 
qualities  endearing  him  to  all  and  pleasing  to  record.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  In  his  love  and  zeal  for  truth,  he  is  equal  to  Indra.  Thou, 
O  King,  art  exalted  above  all  in  the  House  of  Ikshwaku,  yet 
none  in  the  world  practises  righteousness  as  does  Shri  Rama. 

"  By  his  conduct,  he  has  added  lustre  to  virtue  and  prosperity. 
Diffusing  happiness  among  his  people,  he  resembles  the  moon 
delighting  the  earth.  In  forbearance,  he  is  like  the  earth,  in  wisdom 
like  Brihaspati,  in  valour  like  Indra.  With  a  deep  regard  for  truth, 
free  from  envy  and  jealousy,  his  disposition  is  excellent. 

"  Forgiving  every  injury,  a  comforter  of  the  afflicted  and  the 
distressed,  he  addresses  all  with  gentleness.  Acknowledging 
every  favour  received  in  full  measure,  self-controlled,  true  to 
his  word  whatever  betide,  speaking  no  ill  of  others,  of  candid 
utterance,  full  of  wisdom  he  ever  reveres  the  aged. 

"  Of  immeasurable  renown,  Shri  Rama,  whose  glory  and 
splendour  constantly  increase,  who  in  the  science  of  archery 
is  superior  even  to  the  gods,  asuras  and  men,  who  has  studied 
all  the  branches  of  learning  and  the  Veda,  is  also  unequalled  in 
the  art  of  music.  The  abode  of  peace  and  prosperity,  ever 
courteous,  humble  and  wise,  and  who,  having  received  the 
highest  instruction  from  the  brahmins,  is  skilful  in  expounding 
the  meaning  of  the  Veda. 

"  When  in  company  with  Lakshmana,  he  goes  to  the  attack, 
storming  towns  and  villages,  he  never  withdraws  without  wholly 
defeating  the  enemy.  Returning  triumphant,  he  enquires  after 
the  welfare  of  his  subjects  as  if  they  were  his  own  sons,  and 
gives  special  thought  to  the  well-being  of  women,  servants  and 
his  disciples  as  a  father  regards  the  needs  of  his  family. 

"  O  Sire,  Shri  Rama  graciously  enquires  respecting  our  own 
disciples  whether  they  render  us  proper  service  and  hospitality 
and  further  discharge  their  duties  faithfully. 

"  He  suffers  with  the  afflicted  and  rejoices  like  a  parent  when 
his  people  hold  a  festival.  That  mighty  archer,  the  observer 
of  truth,  the  servant  of  the  aged,  who  blesses  all  those  who  seek 
his  protection,  is  wholly  righteous.  Performing  noble  deeds, 
he  will  not  hear  or  utter  words  that  create  discord.  Possessing 
a  charming  brow  and  large  eyes,  in  this  resembling  Vishnu 
himself,  Rama,  by  the  process  of  deduction,  is  able  to  converse 
with  eloquence.  By  his  courage,  prowess,  self-reliance  and 
patience,  he  has  become  the  delight  of  his  people. 
154 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

"  Ever  ready  to  serve  his  subjects,  scorning  sensual  pleasures, 
he  is  able  to  rule  the  three  worlds,  how  much  more  this  tiny 
earth? 

"  His  joy  and  anger  are  never  excited  without  cause.  He 
destroys  those  meriting  death,  but  shows  mercy  to  the  innocent. 

"  Liberal  to  those  who  have  found  favour  with  him ;  willing 
to  suffer  in  the  exercise  of  self-control ;  beloved  of  his  subjects, 
he  evokes  devotion  in  every  virtuous  heart. 

"  Brilliant  as  the  moon  by  reason  of  his  excellent  attributes, 
the  earth  claims  him  as  her  lord. 

"  O  King,  thou  art  fortunate  in  possessing  this  great  son 
who  resembles  Kashyapa,  the  son  of  Marichi.  The  people  of 
Ayodhya  and  the  citizens  of  the  kingdom  of  Koshala  continually 
pray  for  Rama's  life  and  well-being. 

"  Men,  women,  the  aged  and  those  from  far  and  near,  at  dawn 
and  eventide,  unitedly  pray  to  all  the  gods  that  Shri  Rama  may 
ever  be  attended  by  prosperity.  O  Great  King,  graciously 
accede  to  our  request.  O  Giver  of  boons,  we  beg  thee  to  install 
Shri  Rama  as  regent  without  delay.  Thy  son,  resembling 
Shri  Vishnu  himself,  is  benevolent  and  generous  to  all.  O  King, 
do  this  with  a  cheerful  mind." 


CHAPTER    3 

The  king  resolves  Shri  Rama  shall  be  installed 

To  those  who  with  joined  palms  were  making  this  petition, 
King  Dasaratha  answered  courteously : — 

"  To-day,  indeed,  I  am  happy  and  fortunate  since  the  people 
desire  my  son,  Shri  Rama,  to  be  proclaimed  regent." 

Thus,  in  the  presence  of  his  subjects,  the  king  in  gracious 
accents  addressed  Shri  Vasishtha,  Vamadeva  and  other  sages : — 

"  In  this  month  of  Chitra,  when  the  woods  are  beautiful  with 
flowering  trees,  be  pleased,  O  Holy  Ones,  to  prepare  all  things 
for  the  installation  of  my  son  as  heir-apparent." 
155 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

After  the  king  had  spoken,  the  people  applauded,  and  when 
the  shouts  of  acclamation  had  died  away,  the  monarch  addressed 
the  mighty  Sage  Vasishtha,  saying :  "  O  Blessed  Lord,  it  is  meet 
that  thou  shouldest  order  those  things  needful  for  the  coronation 
ceremony." 

Then  Shri  Vasishtha  commanded  the  ministers  in  attendance 
to  provide  gold,  gems,  unguents,  garlands  of  white  flowers, 
parched  rice,  honey  and  clarified  butter  in  separate  vessels,  also 
new  cloths,  chariots,  weapons  of  all  kinds,  a  complete  army, 
elephants  free  from  any  imperfection,  white  flags,  a  white  canopy, 
chamaras,1  a  hundred  vessels  of  gold  shining  like  fire,  bulls 
with  gilded  horns,  lion  skins  and  other  requisites. 

Then  the  Sage  Vasishtha  commanded  them,  saying :  "  Place 
all  these  in  the  king's  sacred  pavilion.  Let  every  gate  in  the 
capital  and  the  private  apartments  of  the  palace  be  decorated 
with  garlands  and  sandalwood,  and  let  fragrant  incense  be 
kindled  everywhere. 

"O  Ye  Accomplished  Ministers,  provide  sweet  and  health- 
giving  foods,  milks  and  curds  in  attractive  dishes  sufficient  to  feed 
a  hundred  thousand  brahmins.  To-morrow  the  holy  brahmins 
should  be  respectfully  served  with  butter,  curdled  milk  and 
parched  rice,  and  presented  with  as  much  dakshina  as  will 
preserve  them  from  want  for  the  remainder  of  their  lives. 

"  To-morrow,  early  in  the  morning,  the  Peace  Chant  should 
be  recited,  therefore,  let  the  holy  brahmins  be  invited  and  their 
seats  prepared.  Let  banners  and  arches  of  flowers  be  displayed 
everywhere,  and  the  roads  sprinkled  with  water.  Let  beautifully 
attired  singing  girls  with  their  attendants  wait  at  the  gates  of 
the  palace ;  let  food  and  cooling  drinks  be  provided  at  all  the 
principal  crossroads,  also  gifts  of  money  and  ritual  objects  that 
are  considered  sacred ;  let  fruit  and  flowers  be  sent  separately ; 
let  armed  warriors  clothed  in  clean  raiment  and  armed  with 
scimitars,  wait  in  the  courtyard  of  the  king." 

In  this  manner,  Shri  Vasishtha  and  Shri  Vamadeva  performed 
all  that  had  been  required  by  the  king  and,  everything  being  carried 
out  to  their  satisfaction,  they  informed  the  great  monarch  accord- 
ingly. Then  the  illustrious  sovereign  said  to  the  prime  minister 
Sumantra :  "  Let  the  accomplished  Prince  Rama  be  brought 

1  Chamarai- — Whitki  made  of  yai**  tuli. 

I5« 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

here  with  all  speed."  Acquiescing  in  the  royal  command) 
Sumantra  brought  thither  in  a  royal  chariot  that  great  warrior, 
Shri  Rama.  Surrounded  by  the  rulers  of  the  earth,  the  east, 
the  west,  the  north  and  the  south,  the  kings  of  aryan  and 
non-aryan  descent  and  those  from  the  forests  and  the  hills, 
King  Dasaratha  looked  like  Indra  in  the  midst  of  the  gods. 

He  beheld  his  son  Shri  Ramachandra,  handsome,  valorous, 
of  mighty  length  of  arm,  fearless,  walking  like  sn  intoxicated 
elephant,  his  countenance  resembling  the  moon,  fair  to  look 
upon,  captivating  the  hearts  of  all  by  his  virtue  and  generosity, 
refreshing  his  subjects  as  clouds  refresh  those  afflicted  with  the 
heat. 

The  monarch  could  not  gaze  sufficiently  on  his  beloved  son 
as  he,  attended  by  Sumantra  who  followed  him  with  reverence, 
alighted  from  his  chariot  and  ascended  the  steps  of  the  royal  palace 
which  resembled  Mount  Kailasha.  Approaching  the  king  he 
announced  his  name  and  made  profound  obeisance  at  his  feet. 

Seeing  the  prince  standing  respectfully  at  his  side,  the  king 
embraced  him  and  asked  him  to  occupy  the  golden  throne  set 
with  jewels  and  gold.  Raghava  thus  seated  looked  like  the  sun 
rising  on  the  Sumeru  mountain.  The  whole  assembly  was 
illumined  by  the  presence  of  Shri  Rama  who  resembled  the 
moon  riding  in  the  autumn  sky  filled  with  innumerable  stars. 

As  a  man  adorned  with  many  ornaments  is  overjoyed  with 
delight  to  see  his  own  image  reflected  in  a  mirror,  so  was  King 
Dasaratha  filled  with  ineffable  delight  when  beholding  the  glory 
of  his  son ;  and  like  Kashyapa  addressing  Indra,  the  mighty 
sovereign  smilingly  spoke  to  Rama : — 

"  O  My  Son,  thou  art  the  offspring  of  my  chief  queen  and 
do  resemble  her,  thou  art  exceedingly  dear  to  me,  endowed  as 
thou  art  with  all  the  great  attributes,  thou  hast  imbued  thy  people 
with  thy  noble  qualities ;  accept  therefore  the  high  office  of 
regent.  Notwithstanding,  My  Son,  that  thou  art  by  nature 
endowed  with  all  good  qualities  and  art  humble,  yet  hear  while 
I  tell  thee  that  which  is  for  thy  good. 

"  Keep  far  from  thee  those  evil  habits  born  of  love,  pleasure 
and  anger ;  through  thy  secret  service  acquaint  thyself  closely 
with  all  the  happenings  of  thy  kingdom  and  other  domains, 
157 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

as  though  they  took  place  before  thine  eyes.  Give  pleasure  to 
thy  people  by  filling  the  various  storehouses  and  arsenals.  O 
Prince,  that  sovereign  who  rules  his  subjects  with  due  regard 
to  their  happiness  causes  his  friends  to  rejoice  like  the  gods 
who  have  drunk  the  nectar  of  immortality.  Wherefore,  O  my 
Child,  conduct  thyself  with  a  mind  fully  subdued." 

Then,  the  friends  of  Rama  acquainted  Queen  Kaushalya  of 
the  king's  resolve  and  she  rewarded  the  messengers  of  these 
good  tidings  with  many  cows  and  gems. 

Shri  Rama,  hearing  the  king's  words,  answered :  "  So  be  it," 
and,  bowing  to  the  great  monarch,  left  the  palace  in  his  chariot, 
the  people  greeting  him  with  joy  as  he  passed  by. 

Satisfied  with  the  sovereign's  decree,  they  acclaimed  him 
with  salutations  and  returning  to  their  homes  worshipped  their 
gods,  propitiating  them  so  that  no  impediment  should  arise  in 
the  installation  of  Shri  Rama  as  regent. 


CHAPTER    4 

Shri  Rama  and  Princess  Sita  prepare  for  the  ceremony 

The  citizens  having  departed,  the  king  again  consulted  his 
ministers,  saying  to  them :  "  To-morrow,  the  Pushya  star  is 
in  the  ascendant,  I  decree,  therefore,  that  the  lotus-eyed  Rama 
shall  then  be  installed  as  my  successor." 

Dismissing  his  counsellors,  the  king,  entering  the  inner 
apartment,  commanded  Sumantra  to  bring  Rama  to  him  once 
more.  In  obedience  to  the  command  of  his  royal  master, 
Sumantra  repaired  to  the  palace  of  Rama,  to  bring  him  thither. 

Rama,  hearing  the  doorkeeper  announce  the  second  visit  of 
the  minister,  became  anxious  and  sending  for  him  with  all  haste 
inquired  of  him  the  purport  of  his  coming.  Sumantra  answered, 
saying :  "  The  king  desires  to  see  thee."  Shri  Rama  thereupon 
hastily  repaired  to  the  palace  of  his  royal  parent. 

King  Dasaratha  retiring  to  the  private  apartment,  issued 
instructions  that  Rama  should  be  brought  thither.  The  prince, 
158 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

entering  his  father's  palace,  bowed  low,  with  joined  palms,  from 
a  distance,  and  contemplated  his  sire. 

The  king,  raising  him  up,  embraced  him  and,  giving  him 
a  seat,  again  addressed  him : — 

"  O  Prince,  I  have  now  grown  old  and  have  ruled  long, 
enjoying  all  the  pleasures  of  the  heart.  I  have  also  performed 
hundreds  of  sacrifices  and  distributed  great  quantities  of  food 
and  lavish  gifts  as  alms  to  the  brahmins.  O  Great  One,  a  son 
such  as  thou  art,  is  the  fruit  of  much  charity  and  study  of  the 
Veda.  O  Most  Excellent  One,  what  I  desired  to  give  in  charity, 
I  have  given,  and  I  have  studied  the  Veda  and  offered  up  many 
sacrifices.  My  desire  for  pleasure  is  past ;  I  have  discharged 
every  obligation  to  the  gods,  the  sages,  my  ancestors  and  the 
learned  brahmins,  nothing  remains  to  be  accomplished  by  me 
but  thine  installation.  O  My  Son,  hear  me,  it  is  the  will  of  my 
people  that  thou  become  their  sovereign;  I  shall,  therefore, 
install  thee  as  my  successor.  Nevertheless,  O  Rama,  fearful 
dreams  have  visited  me  at  night,  attended  by  the  roar  of  thunder 
and  the  falling  of  meteors,  signs  betokening  opposition.  O 
Rama,  the  star  of  my  birth  is  surrounded  by  the  sun,  Mars 
and  Rami ;  those  versed  in  divination  speak  of  it  as  of  evil 
augury,  that  portends  either  the  death  of  a  king  or  the  visitation 
of  some  grave  calamity.  O  Prince  of  Raghu,  I  desire  to  see 
thee  crowned  before  my  senses  fail.  Verily,  the  mind  of  man  is 
inconstant.  To-day,  the  astrologers  announce  that  Purnavasu 
is  in  the  ascendant,  but  to-morrow  it  will  be  the  Pushya  star, 
auspicious  to  thy  coronation.  X  desire  thee,  therefore,  to  be 
proclaimed  regent  to-morrow.  Do  thou,  from  now  on,  fast 
with  thy  spouse,  passing  the  night  on  a  bed  of  kusha  grass, 
with  a  stone  for  thy  pillow.  It  is  the  duty  of  the  friends 
surrounding  thee  to  guard  thee.  In  such  undertakings  many 
obstructions  arise. 

"  Prince  Bharata  is  in  the  city  of  his  grandsire,  it  is  my  will 
that  thou  be  installed  in  his  absence.  Thy  brother,  Bharata, 
is  virtuous,  compassionate,  master  of  his  senses  and  obedient 
to  thee,  yet,  O  Prince,  I  know  the  mind  of  man  to  be  fickle, 
even  the  mind  of  a  righteous  and  devout  man  may  be  subject 
to  inconstancy.  To-morrow,  thy  coronation  shall  take  place, 
therefore,  now  return  to  thy  abode." 

159  M 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

King  Dasaratha  having  thus  spoken,  Shri  Rama  left  for  his 
palace.  Entering  his  own  abode,  anxious  to  acquaint  Janaki 
with  the  king's  proposal  and  not  finding  the  princess  in  her 
own  apartment,  Rama  repaired  to  the  palace  of  his  mother. 
There  he  beheld  the  Queen  Kaushalya,  seated  in  the  temple, 
observing  the  vow  of  silence  and  praying  for  her  son's  welfare. 
Acquainted  with  the  sovereign's  decree,  Shri  Lakshmana  and 
Sumitra  were  already  in  the  palace  of  the  chief  queen,  and  Sita 
also  having  been  summoned  thither  was  sitting  at  her  side. 

Queen  Kaushalya  attended  by  Queen  Sumitra,  Lakshmana 
and  Sita,  having  heard  that  Shri  Rama  would  be  installed  when 
the  Pushya  star  was  in  the  ascendant,  was  meditating  on 
Narayana,1  with  closed  eyes  and  controlled  breathing. 

Shri  Rama,  approaching  his  mother,  paid  reverence  to  her 
and  joyfully  exclaimed :  "  O  Mother,  my  father  has  commanded 
me  to  serve  the  people  and  to-morrow  I  am  to  take  up  the 
burden  of  government.  Shri  Vasishtha,  my  preceptor,  and 
other  sages  have  ordained  that  the  Princess  Sita  should,  this 
night,  fast  with  me.  At  dawn,  the  Princess  Sita  and  I  will 
carry  out  those  prayers  and  rites  proper  to  the  occasion." 

Queen  Kaushalya,  long  desirous  of  this  event,  with  tears  of 
joy  flowing  from  her  eyes,  answered :  "  O  My  Beloved  Son 
Rama,  mayest  thou  live  long  and  may  all  thine  enemies  perish. 
Acquiring  the  throne,  mayest  thou  bring  joy  to  thy  friends, 
relatives  and  also  Queen  Sumitra.  O  Child,  surely  thou  wert 
born  under  an  auspicious  star  since  thou  hast  won  favour  with 
thy  royal  sire  by  thine  excellent  attributes.  The  purpose  of  my 
devotion  and  austerity,  undertaken  to  please  the  lotus-eyed 
Narayana,  has  been  fulfilled  to-day  inasmuch  as  thou  art  about 
to  obtain  the  kingdom  of  the  dynasty  of  Raghu." 

Shri  Rama  listening  to  his  mother's  words,  smilingly  addressed 
Shri  Lakshmana,  he  who  ever  paid  honour  to  his  father,  and 
said :  "  O  Lakshmana,  share  with  me  the  government  of  the 
kingdom,  thou  art  my  second  self,  the  dominion  is  equally  thine. 
O  Brother,  I  desire  life  and  a  kingdom  for  thy  sake." 

Thereafter,  Shri  Rama,  bowing  to  the  two  queens,  with 
their  permission  withdrew  with  Sita  to  his  own  apartment.

CHAPTER    5 

On  Vasishtha's  advice  they  observe  a  fast 

King  Dasaratha,  having  acquainted  his  son  Rama  with  the 
knowledge  of  his  approaching  regency,  now  called  his  spiritual 
preceptor,  Shri  Vasishtha,  and  addressed  him,  saying  :  "  O  Sage, 
whose  only  wealth  is  austerity,  graciously  approach  Shri  Rama 
and  cause  him  to  observe  a  fast  with  Princess  Site  in  preparation 
for  his  coronation." 

Shri  Vasishtha  answering,  "  Be  it  so  ",  went  himself  to  Shri 
Rama's  palace.  Ascending  a  chariot  drawn  by  two  horses,  he 
drove  to  the  palace,  and  entering  by  the  three  gates,  approached 
the  abode  of  Raghava,  white  as  a  cloud. 

Shri  Rama  hearing  of  the  arrival  of  his  preceptor,  speedily 
went  forth  to  welcome  him  and  oifer  him  due  obeisance.  Taking 
him  by  the  hand,  he  assisted  him  to  alight  from  the  chariot 
and,  studying  his  mood,  made  enquiries  as  to  his  well-being. 

The  venerable  Vasishtha  said :  "  O  Rama,  thy  royal  parent 
is  gracious  to  thee,  to-morrow  thou  shalt  be  proclaimed  ruler 
of  the  kingdom,  do  thou  observe  a  fast  to-day.  To-morrow, 
King  Dasaratha  will  install  thee  as  regent,  as  Nahusha  of  old 
made  over  his  kingdom  to  Yayati." 

Having  uttered  these  words,  the  knower  of  truth,  the  sovereign 
of  munis,  requested  Rama  and  Sita  to  observe  a  fast  that  night. 

Then  Shri  Ramachandra  respectfully  saluted  Shri  Vasishtha, 
and  the  royal  preceptor  accepting  his  salutation  departed  for 
his  abode. 

Conversing  delightfully  with  his  friends,  Shri  Rama,  when 
requested  by  them,  retired  to  the  inner  apartments.  The  palace 
of  Raghava  was  crowded  with  joyful  men  and  women,  and 
resembled  a  lake  rilled  with  lotuses  visited  by  innumerable  birds. 

Leaving  the  palace,  Shri  Vasishtha  perceived  the  streets  to 
be  filled  with  people.  All  the  roads  entering  Ayodhya  were  so 
crowded  with  spectators  eager  to  witness  Shri  Rama's  coronation 
that  none  could  pass  to  and  fro  without  difficulty.  The 
sound  of  the  multitudes  shouting  with  joy,  filling  the  highways, 
resembled  the  roaring  of  the  sea. 
161 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALM1KI 

All  the  streets  of  the  capital  were  swept  and  sprinkled  with 
water ;  on  either  side,  flower  garlands  were  hanging,  and  every 
house  was  decorated  with  Hags  and  banners.  Men  and  women, 
children  and  the  aged,  all  anxiously  awaiting  the  dawn,  so  that 
they  might  witness  the  sacred  ceremony,  looked  forward  with 
eagerness  to  the  great  festival  that  would  promote  their  happiness. 

The  priest  Shri  Vasishtha,  avoiding  the  crowded  streets,  at 
length  reached  the  royal  palace.  Ascending  the  balcony  which 
resembled  a  white  cloud,  he  greeted  the  king  as  Brihaspati  pays 
homage  to  Indra. 

Seeing  the  sage  approaching,  the  king  rose  and  enquired  as 
to  what  Shri  Rama  had  said.  Shri  Vasishtha  answered,  "All 
is  prepared  ".  As  the  king  rose  from  his  throne,  the  whole 
assembly  stood  up  to  honour  the  venerable  sage. 

Having  heard  his  spiritual  preceptor's  report,  the  king, 
dismissing  the  court,  withdrew  to  the  inner  apartment,  as  a  lion 
enters  its  cave.  Entering  those  gorgeous  and  richly  ornamented 
apartments  equal  to  one  of  Indra's  palaces,  he  resembled  the 
moon  gliding  through  the  heavens. 


CHAPTER    6 

The  city  of  Ayodhya  is  decorated  for  the  proclamation 

Shri  Vasishtha  having  taken  his  departure,  Shri  Ramachandra 
and  the  large-eyed  Sita  purified  themselves,  and  mentally  adored 
the  Lord  Narayana.  Offering  salutations  to  the  vessel  containing 
the  sacrificial  oblation  and  to  propitiate  Narayana,  Shri  Rama 
poured  clarified  butter  into  the  sacred  fire.  Thereafter  partaking  of 
the  remainder  of  the  offering  and  praying  for  what  was  auspicious, 
seated  on  the  kusha  grass,  he  meditated  on  Shri  Narayana. 
Observing  silence  with  purified  minds,  the  prince  and  princess 
slept  in  the  temple.  Three  hours  before  the  dawn,  they  rose 
and  caused  their  servants  to  clean  and  decorate  the  palace. 
Then,  after  listening  to  the  recitation  of  the  dynastic  ballads 
causing  them  great  delight,  they  performed  their  morning 
162 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

devotions  and  silently  repeated  the  Gayatri.  As  the  sun  rose, 
clad  in  silken  garments,  they  saluted  Shri  Narayana  abiding  in 
the  golden  orb  and  then  instructed  the  learned  brahmins  to 
recite  the  Peace  Chant  and  other  prayers. 

The  deep  and  melodious  sound  of  the  Peace  Chant,  recited 
by  the  brahmins,  mingling  with  the  beat  of  drums,  filled  the 
capital  of  Ayodhya.  The  inhabitants  of  the  city,  knowing  that 
Rama  and  Sita  were  observing  a  fast  and  offering  devotion  to 
the  Lord,  were  filled  with  joy. 

On  the  dawning  of  day,  the  citizens  brought  banyan  trees, 
setting  them  up  as  pillars  to  adorn  the  city  for  the  coming 
coronation.  The  high  temples  resembling  the  Himalayan  peaks, 
the  stately  houses,  the  highways,  the  crescents  and  streets,  the 
shops  filled  with  merchandise,  the  mansions  where  members  of 
the  royal  family  dwelt,  the  public  assembly  halls  and  the  tall 
trees  were  all  hung  with  flags  of  different  colours  which  fluttered 
in  the  breeze.  Here  and  there,  companies  of  actors  and  dancers 
gave  pleasure  to  the  people  by  singing  sweetly  and  playing 
melodiously  on  their  instruments.  In  the  market,  in  the  houses, 
at  home  and  abroad,  all  spoke  only  of  the  coming  proclamation 
of  Shri  Rama  as  ruler.  Children  playing  in  front  of  their  homes 
also  chattered  about  this  matter. 

In  honour  of  the  occasion,  the  roads  were  strewn  with  flowers, 
and  rendered  fragrant  with  incense  and  pleasant  odours ;  lamps 
were  placed  here  and  there  lest  the  royal  procession  should  pass 
through  at  night. 

Having  decorated  the  city,  the  inhabitants  awaiting  the 
proclamation,  came  together  in  public  assemblies  or  stood  on 
raised  tribunes.  Praising  King  Dasaratha,  they  said  :  "  That 
mighty  King  Dasaratha  of  the  dynasty  of  Ikswaku  is  indeed 
a  pious  man.  Realising  he  has  grown  old,  he,  himself,  is 
installing  Rama  as  ruler.  How  gracious  is  our  king  that  he  is 
placing  us  under  the  rule  of  Shri  Ramachandra.  May  the  Lord 
long  protect  the  prince  as  our  ruler.  Shri  Rama  is  simple, 
highly  learned,  devoted  to  righteousness  and  affectionate  to  his 
brothers.  Virtuous  and  wise,  Shri  Rama  loves  us  as  his  own 
brethren.  May  the  righteous  and  sinless  King  Dasaratha  live 
long,  by  whose  grace,  we  see  Rama  enthroned  to-day." 

Hearing  the  praises  of  King  Dasaratha  by  the  people,  those 
i63 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

living  far  distant  were  attracted  to  the  holy  ceremony  and  flocked 
to  see  the  royal  procession,  rilling  the  city  of  Ayodha  Puri. 

On  the  day  of  the  full  moon,  the  tumult  of  the  multitude 
was  like  the  roar  of  the  ocean.  People  coming  from  far  and  near 
to  Ayodhya  which  resembled  the  city  of  Amaravati,  enhanced 
the  beauty  of  the  capital  as  aquatic  creatures  add  to  the  beauty 
of  the  sea. 


chapter   7 

The  hunchback  maid,  Manthara,  informs  Queen  Kaikeyi 
of  Shii  Rama's  coming  installation 

At  this  time,  Queen  Kaikeyi  had  a  female  servant  who  had 
accompanied  her  from  the  abode  of  her  royal  parent  and  was 
ever  in  attendance  on  the  queen.    Her  name  was  Manthara. 

By  chance,  ascending  the  balcony  of  the  palace  which 
resembled  the  full  moon,  she  perceived  the  capital  of  Ayodhya 
adorned  with  garlands  of  lotuses  and  the  principal  streets 
sprinkled  with  water.  Flags  were  fluttering  from  the  tops  of 
the  tall  houses,  the  roads  levelled,  and  the  wide  streets  crowded 
with  people.  Holy  brahmins  carrying  auspicious  gifts  were 
waiting  to  offer  them  to  Shri  Ramachandra ;  the  temples  were 
painted  white  and  strains  of  musical  instruments  resounded 
everywhere.  Elated  by  the  festivities,  joyful  crowds  were 
singing  the  Vedic  mantras  and  not  only  men  but  elephants, 
horses  and  cattle  demonstrated  their  joy  in  their  own  peculiar 
fashion.  Large  flags  bound  with  flowers  were  being  carried 
by  joyous  citizens  wandering  here  and  there. 

Manthara  was  amazed  to  see  these  unusual  activities  and, 
meeting  Shri  Rama's  royal  nurse  gaily  dressed  in  a  white  silken 
robe,  she  enquired  of  her,  saying :  "  Why  is  the  wealthy  Queen 
Kaushalya,  mother  of  Shri  Rama,  distributing  immense  riches 
in  charity  to-day  ?  Why  are  the  people  of  the  capital  so  joyous  ? 
What  is  the  happy  king  about  to  accomplish  ?  " 

The  royal  nurse,  overcome  with  joy  at  that  time,  told  the 
164 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

hunchbacked  Manthara  of  Rama's  enthronement.  She  said  : 
**  To-morrow,  at  dawn,  under  the  Pushya  star,  King  Dasaratha 
will  install  the  sinless  Rama,  the  subduer  of  anger,  as  Yuvaraja." 
The  words  of  the  nurse  filled  the  hunchbacked  woman  with 
jealous  wrath.  Speedily  descending  from  the  high  palace  which 
resembled  Mt.  Kailasa,  that  sinful  woman,  consumed  with 
malice,  entered  the  bedchamber  of  Queen  Kaikeyi  and,  waking 
her,  thus  addressed  her  :— 

"  Why  art  thou  sleeping,  O  Deluded  One  ?  Thou  art  in 
imminent  peril ;  art  thou  blind  to  future  suffering  ?  O  Fair 
One,  the  good  fortune  which  thou  vauntest  is  about  to  pass 
away,  like  a  river  that  is  dried  up  in  the  summer  season." 

Queen  Kaikeyi,  pained  by  the  bitter  words  of  the  sinful 
hunchbacked  maid,  answered  her  saying :  "  O  Manthara,  is  all 
well  ?  Why  do  I  behold  thee  with  a  gloomy  mien,  what  is  the 
cause  of  thy  distress  ?  " 

Hearing  the  gentle  accents  of  Queen  Kaikeyi,  Manthara,  who 
was  full  of  cunning,  assuming  a  sorrowful  mien  and  feigning 
friendship  for  the  queen,  spoke  bitterly,  "  O  Devi,  a  great 
calamity  has  befallen  thee.  Hear  me !  King  Dasaratha  is 
about  to  proclaim  Shri  Ramachandra  as  regent.  I  am  immersed 
in  the  bottomless  sea  of  fear ;  I  am  afflicted  with  pain  and 
sorrow ;  I  am  as  if  scorched  by  fire,  and  for  thy  good  I  have 
come  hither.  O  Kaikeyi,  thy  woes  are  my  woes,  thy  sorrows 
my  sorrows,  of  this  I  am  certain.  Hearken !  Thou  art  the 
daughter  of  a  great  royal  House  and  thou  art  the  favourite  of 
King  Dasaratha.  Why  art  thou  deceived  by  bis  crafty  ways  ? 
Outwardly,  thy  husband  appears  to  be  a  speaker  of  truth,  but, 
inwardly,  he  is  a  deceitful  man.  His  speech  is  fair,  but  his 
heart  is  hard.  Thy  honesty  is  the  cause  of  thy  suffering. 
Prevailing  on  thee  .by  specious  words,  the  king  visits  thee  and 
speaks  insincere  words  to  thee.  By  delivering  the  kingdom  to 
Kaushalya's  son,  he  seeks  to  make  her  mistress  of  all.  Like 
an  affectionate  mother,  thou  hast  nourished  in  thy  lap  the  enemy 
that  is  called  thy  lord.  Thou  resemblest  the  one  who  pressed 
a  serpent  to  her  bosom  deeming  it,  through  illusion,  to  be  her 
infant.  As  a  snake  or  an  enemy  harms  the  one  who  has  spared 
him,  so  has  King  Dasaratha  to-day  dealt  with  thee  and  thy  son. 
165 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

This  sinful)  deceitful  monarch  will  destroy  thee,  thy  son  and 
thy  relatives,  who  are  worthy  of  happiness,  by  enthroning  Shri 
Ramachandra.  O  Thou  of  Deluded  Intellect,  ever  indifferent 
to  thine  own  good,  hear  me,  there  is  yet  time.  Whatever  thou 
can'st  do  for  thine  own  advantage  perform  and  thus  protect 
thy  son  and  me." 

Hearing  the  words  of  Manthara,  the  beautiful  queen  rose 
from  her  couch,  like  the  autumnal  moon.  Filled  with  wonder 
and  delight,  she  took  from  her  person  a  precious  ornament  and 
presented  it  to  the  hunchback  woman. 

That  lovely  one,  unequalled  in  beauty  among  youthful  women, 
said  to  Manthara :  "  O  Manthara,  thou  hast  brought  me  joyful 
tidings.  Tell  me,  what  I  can  offer  thee  in  return  for  these 
pleasing  words?  I  find  no  difference  between  Rama  and 
Bharata.  I  am,  therefore,  fully  satisfied  if  the  king  installs 
Shri  Ramachandra.  O  Dear  One,  nothing  is  more  pleasing  to 
me  than  the  news  of  Shri  Rama's  enthronement.  Ask  for 
whatever  pleases  thee,  and  I  will  confer  it  on  thee." 


CHAPTER    8 

Manthara  persuades  the  queen  that  Bharata  should  be  regent 
and  Prince  Rama  banished 

Prompted  by  disappointment  and  anger,  Manthara,  casting  the 
jewel  away,  in  disdain,  cried :  "  O  Foolish  Queen,  this  is  no 
occasion  for  rejoicing,  dost  thou  know  that  thou  art  about  to  be 
submerged  in  a  sea  of  sorrow  ?  I  cannot  but  laugh  silently 
at  thy  folly.  Thou  rejoicest  when  there  is  reason  to  mourn ! 
I  pity  thy  simplicity,  how  should  a  woman  rejoice  in  the 
advancement  of  the  son  of  her  enemy  ?  Prince  Bharata  has  an 
equal  right  to  the  kingdom  with  Ramachandra.  Rama  fears 
Prince  Bharata  and,  fearing  him,  seeks  to  displace  him.  Laksh- 
mana,  though  heir  to  the  throne,  is  Rama's  obedient  servant, 
just  as  Prince  Shatrughna  is  faithful  to  Bharata.  O  Beautiful 
One,  by  birth  Bharata  has  a  claim  to  the  throne.  Traditionally, 
1 66 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

the  kingdom  should  be  his.  Shri  Rama  is  well-versed  in  affairs 
of  state,  and  acts  promptly  in  his  own  interests.  Knowing  the 
danger  threatening  Bharata  from  Rams,  I  am  filled  with  dread. 

"  To-day,  Queen  Kaushalya  is  fortunate  indeed ;  her  son 
will  be  enthroned  by  the  holy  brahmins  at  dawn,  when  the 
Pushya  star  is  in  the  ascendant.  Thereafter,  thou  shalt  have 
to  stand  in  complete  submission  like  a  stone,  before  Queen 
Kaushalya  whose  enemies  will  be  subdued.  Thus,  not  only 
thou,  but  the  virtuous  Prince  Bharata  will  become  a  servant 
and  dependent  on  the  Queen  Kaushalya.  The  women  of  Shri 
Rama's  household  will  be  filled  with  joy,  but  thy  daughters- 
in-law,  having  no  status,  will  suffer  great  anxiety  and  sorrow." 

Queen  Kaikeyi  believing  Manthara  really  to  be  benevolently 
disposed  to  her,  began  to  extol  the  great  virtues  of  Ramachandra, 
saying :  "  Shri  Rama  instructed  by  his  holy  Guru  is  truly 
righteous,  grateful,  truthful  and  pious ;  he,  the  eldest  son  of 
the  king,  assuredly  deserves  to  be  made  regent.  May  he  live 
long  !  He  will  ever  protect  his  brothers  and  servants  as  a  father 
protects  his  children.  O  Kubija,1  why  art  thou  jealous  of  Rama's 
coronation  ?  After  a  hundred  years,  Bharata  will  inherit  the 
throne  of  his  illustrious  ancestors.  Why  art  thou  sad  on  such 
a  joyful  occasion,  O  Manthara  ?  Shri  Ramachandra  is  as  dear 
to  me  as  is  Bharata,  he  serves  me  with  greater  zeal  even  than 
he  does  Queen  Kaushalya.  If  Shri  Rama  ascends  the  throne, 
it  is  as  if  Bharata  ruled  the  land ;  Shri  Rama  regards  his  brother 
as  himself." 

Hearing  the  Queen's  words,  Manthara  intensely  provoked, 
sighed  deeply  and  said :  "  O  Stupid  One,  thou  deemest  adversity 
to  be  prosperity,  thou  art  sinking  in  an  ocean  of  suffering  and 
yet  dost  not  perceive  it.  When  Rama  becomes  king,  who  will 
succeed  him,  Prince  Bharata  or  his  own  son  ?  Prince  Bharata 
will  remain  without  a  kingdom  forever. 

"  O  Beautiful  Princess,  all  the  sons  of  the  king  cannot  occupy 
the  throne,  and  if  they  could,  it  would  bring  calamity.  Therefore, 
O  Kaikeyi,  the  sovereign  confers  his  throne  on  the  eldest  son ; 
yet,  if  the  younger  son  be  endowed  with  good  qualities  he  may 
succeed ;  the  kingdom  is  given  to  one  and  one  only.  When 
Rama  becomes  king,  then  thy  son  like  an  orphan,  deprived 

1  Kubija — hunchback. 

167 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  all  comfort,  will  be  cast  forth  from  the  royal  dynasty  to  suffer. 
I  have  come  to  tell  thee  this  for  thy  good  and  thou  dost  not 
comprehend  it.  If  thou  wert  wise,  thou  wouldst  not  reward 
me  with  this  jewel  on  account  of  the  increased  prosperity  of  thy 
rival.  Assuredly  when  Rama  assumes  the  regency,  he  will 
either  banish  Prince  Bharata  or  have  him  put  to  death.  Through 
proximity  people  acquire  affection  even  for  inanimate  objects, 
but  thou  didst  send  thy  son  in  his  childhood  to  thy  father's 
house. 

"  Prince  Shatrughna  has  accompanied  Bharata ;  Lakshmana 
follows  Rama  as  Shatrughna  follows  Bharata.  It  is  said  that 
a  tree  marked  down  for  felling  by  the  dwellers  of  the  forest  is 
preserved  by  the  proximity  of  the  thorny  ishika  bushes.  Thus 
will  Lakshmana  ever  protect  Rama,  and  Rama  in  return  will 
preserve  Lakshmana.  These  two  brothers  love  each  other  as 
do  the  Aswins ;  this  is  well  known.  Rama  will,  therefore,  seek 
to  harm  Bharata  though  he  will  ever  protect  Lakshmana.  I, 
therefore,  consider  it  were  best  for  Bharata  to  escape  to  the 
forest.  If  Rama  succeed  to  bis  father's  kingdom,  how  may  thy 
welfare  and  that  of  thy  relatives  be  assured  ?  To  thee  Bharata 
is  a  child  worthy  of  happiness  but  to  Rama  he  is  a  rival. 
When  Rama  is  king,  Bharata  will  not  live  long.  It  becomes 
thee,  therefore,  O  Queen,  to  protect  Prince  Bharata,  as  the  leader 
of  a  herd  of  elephants  protects  it  from  the  lion's  spring. 
Prompted  by  pride,  thou  hast  in  the  past  slighted  Queen 
Kaushalya ;  dost  thou  think  she  will  spare  thee  when  she  is 
chief  queen  ?  O  Beautiful  One,  note  well  when  Rama  obtains 
the  kingdom  together  with  its  mountains,  seas  and  valleys, 
then  thou  and  thy  son,  Prince  Bharata,  will  suffer  ignominy. 
Assuredly,  when  Rama  is  king,  Prince  Bharata  will  be  deprived 
of  life,  therefore,  act  so  that  Rama  may  be  exiled  to  the  forest 
and  Bharata  obtain  the  kingdom."

CHAPTER    9 

Queen  Kaikeyi  is  resolved  upon  her  evil  design 

The  face  of  Queen  Kaikeyi  flushed  with  anger,  and  sighing 
deeply,  she  said  to  Manthara :  "  To-day,  I  shall  indeed  banish 
Rama  and  ensure  that  Bharata  be  proclaimed  regent.  O 
Manthara,  how  may  Bharata  become  regent,  and  Rama  be 
deprived  of  the  kingdom  ?  " 

Hearing  these  words,  the  sinful  Manthara,  bent  upon  the 
complete  destruction  of  Shri  Rama,  said  to  the  queen :  "  Hear, 
O  Kaikeyi,  I  will  unfold  to  thee  the  only  course  which  will  lead 
to  the  coronation  of  Prince  Bharata.  O  Kaikeyi,  hast  thou 
forgotten  that  which  thou  hast  often  related  to  me  ?  O  Lover 
of  Poesy,  if  it  be  thy  desire  to  hear  the  tale  from  my  lips,  listen 
and  then  take  action." 

Thus  addressed,  Queen  Kaikeyi,  rising  from  her  couch, 
replied :  "  O  Manthara,  relate  by  what  means  Bharata  may 
acquire  the  throne  and  Shri  Rama  surfer  eclipse." 

Then  the  wicked  Manthara,  desirous  of  doing  injury  to  Rama, 
said :  "  Formerly  when  thy  husband  was  engaged  in  a  war 
between  the  devas  and  asuras,  he  supported  the  cause  of  Indra. 
He  took  thee  with  him  and  I  accompanied  thee.  O  Kaikeyi, 
to  the  south,  in  the  Dandaka  forest,  there  ruled  a  king  named 
Timidwaja  in  his  capital  Bijayanta.  He  was  versed  in  the  magic 
named  Shambara,  and  he  was  unconquerable  by  the  gods.  He 
waged  war  on  Indra  and  in  the  great  conflict  the  asuras,  at  night, 
carried  off  the  wounded  from  their  beds  and  slew  them.  King 
Dasaratha  fought  great  battles  with  these  asuras  who  pierced 
his  body  many  times  with  their  weapons.  He,  falling  un- 
conscious, thou,  O  Devi,  brought  him  from  the  battlefield  and 
when  they  still  assailed  him,  didst  skilfully  preserve  him.  O 
Beautiful  One,  then  the  king,  thy  lord,  well  pleased  with  thee, 
proffered  thee  two  boons,  and  thou  didst  answer :  *  I  shall  chum 
them  when  the  need  arises.' 

"  I  was  not  then  acquainted  with  this  matter,  but  thou  didst 
later  relate  it  to  me.  Prompted  by  my  love  for  thee,  I  have 
169 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

treasured  all  this  in  my  memory.  Now,  demand  the  cessation 
of  preparations  for  Shri  Rama's  enthronement.  For  the  first 
boon  ask  for  the  proclamation  of  Bharata  as  regent,  and  for 
the  second  the  banishment  of  Rama  for  fourteen  years.  During 
the  period  of  his  exile,  men  will  grow  to  love  thy  son  and  his 
rule  will  be  assured. 

"  O,  Daughter  of  a  Mighty  King,  entering  the  chamber  of 
wrath,  clad  in  soiled  raiment,  cast  thyself  on  the  bare  ground. 
On  the  entrance  of  the  king,  neither  look  at  nor  speak  to  him 
but,  rolling  on  the  ground,  continue  to  weep.  Doubtless  thou 
art  very  dear  to  thy  lord  who,  for  thy  sake,  would  enter  a  raging 
fire.  The  king  would  never  provoke  thee  nor  can  he  bear  to 
see  thee  weep.  He  would  sacrifice  life  itself  for  thy  sake.  The 
king  cannot  be  indifferent  to  thy  requests.  O  Indolent  One, 
test  the  power  of  thy  beauty  to-day ;  but  have  a  care  lest  the 
king  offer  thee  diamonds,  pearls,  gold  and  other  gems,  and  be 
not  caught  in  the  snare  of  greed. 

"  O  Fortunate  One,  remind  the  king  of  the  two  boons  promised 
to  thee  on  the  battlefield ;  strive  hard  for  the  success  of  thine 
undertaking.  If  the  king  would  lift  thee  up,  let  him  on  oath 
renew  his  promise.  Do  thou  say  to  him :  *  O  Great  King, 
send  Rama  into  exile  for  fourteen  years  and  make  Bharata  ruler 
of  the  kingdom.' 

"  Whilst  Rama  is  absent,  the  rule  of  Bharata  will  be  established 
and  he  will  reign  forever.  O  Beautiful  One,  demand  the  exile 
of  Rama,  from  King  Dasaratha,  and  all  will  be  well  with  thy  son. 
Men  will  forget  their  love  for  Rama  and  will  cease  to  care  for 
him,  and  Bharata  will  have  no  enemy  anywhere.  When  Shri 
Rama  returns,  the  supremacy  of  Bharata  will  be  firmly  estab- 
lished ;  ruling  with  love,  he  will  inspire  affection  and  many 
friends  will  support  him.  Therefore,  O  Queen,  questioned  by 
the  king,  fearlessly  and  firmly  demand  that  the  preparations 
for  Rama's  enthronement  be  terminated.'' 

Kaikeyi,  thus  prevailed  upon  to  execute  the  evil  design  of 
Manthara  and  fully  prepared  to  comply  with  it,  followed  her 
counsel  as  a  young  chicken  follows  its  mother.  The  beautiful 
queen,  aggrieved  that  the  king  had  not  consulted  her  concerning 
this  great  event,  said :  "  O  Manthara,  thou  art  truly  my  sincere 
well-wisher !  Of  all  deformed  creatures  on  earth,  thou  art  the 
170 


AYODHYA  KANDA 
wisest.  O  Kubija,  as  yet,  I  fail  to  comprehend  the  king's  real 
intention.  Deformed  women  are  usually  sinful  and  perverse, 
but  thou,  O  Kubija,  art  unique,  resembling  a  lotus  bending  to 
the  breeze.  In  spite  of  thy  physical  defect,  thou  art  not  to  be 
despised.  It  would  seem  that  thy  slender  waist,  bashful  of  thy 
full  rounded  bosom,  had  withdrawn  itself.  O  Manthara,  thy 
face  is  like  the  full  moon,  thou  art  indeed  lovely,  thy  body  is 
smooth,  thy  waist  decorated  with  a  girdle,  thy  thighs  are  long, 
thy  limbs  slender.  O  Manthara,  when  thou  walkest  before  me, 
clad  in  a  silken  sari,  reaching  to  thy  ankles,  thou  art  as  graceful 
as  a  swan. 

"Acquainted  with  every  grace  and  blandishment,  thy  hump 
protruding  like  the  hub  of  a  wheel  is  surely  filled  with  wisdom, 
diplomacy  and  understanding.  I,  therefore,  present  thee  with"' 
a  gold  chain  to  adorn  it. 

"  O  Lovely  Woman,  when  Bharata  becomes  king  and  Rama 
goes  into  exile,  I  will  cover  thy  hump  with  beaten  gold.  When 
I  am  certain  of  the  success  of  my  undertaking,  I  will  apply 
sandalwood  paste  to  thy  hump,  and  to  thy  forehead  a  diadem 
of  gold  and  gems. 

"  O  Kubija,  I  will  give  thee  ornaments  of  pure  gold ;  thus 
attired  and  adorned  thou  shalt  be  free  to  live  as  thou  pleaseth. 
Thou  shalt  put  my  sister  queens  to  shame  and  precede  them 
with  pride.  O  Thou  whose  face  is  incomparably  beautiful,  thou 
art  a  rival  of  the  full  moon.  O  Deformed  One,  many  hunch- 
backed women  wearing  golden  ornaments  shall  attend  thee  as 
thy  handmaids." 

Thus  flattered,  Manthara  reclining  on  a  white  couch,  glowing 
like  an  altar  Same,  spoke :  "  O  Fortunate  One,  it  is  useless  to 
construct  a  dam  when  the  water  has  run  away,  therefore,  enter 
on  thine  undertaking  immediately.  Go  wait  upon  the  king  in 
the  chamber  of  wrath." 

Thus  prompted  by  Kubija,  the  beautiful-eyed  Queen  Kaikeyi, 
filled  with  ambition,  entered  the  chamber  of  wrath  with 
Manthara.  There,  inspired  by  the  hunchbacked  woman, 
casting  her  pearl  necklace  of  immeasurable  value  on  the  ground, 
the  queen  rolling  on  the  floor,  addressed  her :  "  O  Kubija, 
either  Rama  shall  go  into  exile  and  Bharata  obtain  the  kingdom, 
or  King  Dasaratha  will  have  news  of  my  death.  I  shall  neither 
171 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 
put  on  ornaments,  nor  partake  of  delicious  dishes ;  if  Rama 
is  installed,  it  shall  be  the  end  of  my  life." 

Manthara  continued  to  instruct  Kaikeyi  in  the  most  cruel 
manner,  uttering  words  hostile  to  Rama.  "  Know  well,  O 
Fortunate  One,  should  Rama  become  ruler,  it  will  mean  endless 
suffering  for  thee  and  thy  son.  Therefore  exert  thyself  to 
overthrow  him.*' 

The  queen,  wounded  by  the  shafts  of  Manthara's  words, 
placing  both  hands  on  her  heart,  replied  angrily :  "  O  Kubija, 
either  thou  shalt  bear  the  news  of  my  death  to  the  king,  or  Rama 
shall  be  exiled  and  Bharata  enthroned.  If  Rama  be  not  exiled, 
then  I  shall  neither  sleep  on  a  bed  nor  wear  flowing  garments, 
nor  apply  sandalwood  paste  nor  antimony  to  my  person. 
Except  Bharata  be  enthroned,  I  shall  neither  eat  nor  drink.  If 
this  is  not  accomplished,  I  do  not  desire  to  live." 

Having  firmly  resolved  this,  casting  her  ornaments  to 
the  ground,  she,  herself,  lay  down  like  a  fallen  kinnari.1  Her 
face  veiled  in  wrath,  her  body  stripped  of  its  garlands  and 
jewels,  the  queen  resembled  the  sky  bereft  of  sun  and  stars. 


CHAPTER    XO 

The  king  is  deeply  afflicted  at  the  sight  of  the  weeping  queen 

Incited  by  Manthara,  Kaikeyi,  like  a  kinnari,  continued  to 
roll  on  the  ground  as  if  wounded  by  a  poisoned  arrow.  The 
artful  queen,  devising  a  plan,  gradually  unfolded  her  design 
to  Manthara.  Heaving  deep  sighs,  like  a  python,  Manthara 
was  filled  with  satisfaction,  perceiving  her  favourite,  Kaikeyi, 
resolved  on  her  evil  course  of  action. 

Reflecting  on  the  matter,  torn  with  jealousy,  the  queen,  pluck- 
ing out  her  eyebrows,  scattered  her  shining  ornaments  on  the 
ground  adorning  it  as  stars  illumine  the  firmament.   Lying  thus, 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

attired  in  soiled  raiment  with  her  hair  dishevelled)  she  resembled 

a  nymph  fallen  from  heaven. 

The  king,  having  given  his  instructions  for  the  installation 
of  Shri  Rama,  dismissed  the  court  and  entered  the  inner 
apartments  of  the  queens  to  inform  them  of  the  great 
occasion. 

Anxious  to  impart  the  good  tidings  to  his  beloved  consorts, 
the  illustrious  King  Dasaratha  entered  the  inner  apartment, 
first  going  to  the  beautiful  abode  of  Kaikeyi.  As  the  moon 
sails  into  a  clear  sky  after  eclipse,  so  did  the  king  enter  the 
apartment  of  Queen  Kaikeyi.  He  passed  through  the  garden 
made  beautiful  by  parrots,  peacocks,  swans  and  cranes.  Music 
was  softly  playing,  while  dwarfed  and  hunchbacked  maids  passed 
to  and  fro.  There  were  leafy  bowers  and  alcoves  on  whose  walls 
were  painted  beautiful  pictures.  Everywhere  champaka1  and 
asoka2  enhanced  the  view,  whilst  other  trees  were  laden  with 
blossom  and  fruit.  Altars  of  ivory,  silver  and  gold  with  springs 
of  water  flowing  by  seats  inlaid  with  precious  metals  and  costly 
jewels,  where  delicious  food  and  drink  was  constantly  served, 
transformed  the  palace  into  paradise  itself. 

The  king  entered  the  inner  apartments,  but  did  not  perceive 
the  queen  on  the  couch  where  desire  had  caused  him  to  seek 
her.  Calling  loudly  and  receiving  no  answer,  he  grew  sad ; 
never  before  had  Kaikeyi  missed  the  time  of  dalliance,  never 
before  had  the  king  found  the  apartment  deserted.  The  monarch 
desiring  to  know  where  the  queen  was,  questioned  a  maidservant, 
who  replied  with  fear  and  submission :  "  0  Sire,  she  has  entered 
the  chamber  of  wrath." 

On  hearing  these  words,  the  heart  of  the  sovereign  was 
exceedingly  troubled.  Restless  and  agitated  in  mind,  the  king 
bowed  with  sorrow  entered  the  chamber  of  wrath  and  found  the 
queen  lying  on  the  ground  in  an  unseemly  manner.  The  king 
who,  in  his  old  age,  loved  the  young  queen  as  dearly  as  his 
own  life,  was  deeply  afflicted  at  the  sight.  That  sinless  monarch 
beheld  the  ambitious  Kaikeyi  lying  on  the  earth  like  a  branch 
torn  from  a  tree,  or  a  nymph  thrust  forth  from  heaven.  She  lay 
like  an  apsara  fallen  on  the  earth  when  her  merit  is  exhausted, 

"   *  Champaka — magnolia,  Michclia  champaka.

or  like  a  snapped  garland,  or  a  doe  ensnared  by  the  hunter, 
or  like  a  young  elephant  wounded  by  a  poisonous  arrow. 

Standing  over  her  like  an  immense  tusker,  the  monarch 
regarded  her  with  affection.  Gently  caressing  her,  apprehensive 
yet  propelled  by  desire,  the  king  addressed  his  lotus-eyed  queen  : 
"  O  Devi,  I  know  not  why  thou  art  displeased,  by  whom  hast 
thou  been  insulted.  O  tell  me  1  O  Auspicious  One,  I  am 
grieved  to  see  thee  lying  in  the  dust,  why  art  thou,  ever 
benevolent  towards  me,  lying  on  the  earth  ?  Thou  art  as  dear 
to  me  as  my  own  life,  why  dost  thou  act  as  one  possessed  by 
an  evil  spirit  ?  Art  thou  sick  ?  If  so,  I  have  many  eminent 
physicians  who  can  cure  thy  malady,  who  being  satisfied  with 
the  gifts  and  honours  bestowed  on  them,  are  ready  to  obey  my 
will.  In  an  instant  they  shall  restore  thee  to  health.  O 
Beautiful  One,  tell  me  the  symptoms  of  thy  complaint.  Or 
dost  thou  desire  to  reward  or  punish  any  man  ?  Do  not  let 
the  charm  of  thy  face  be  marred  by  grief. 

"  In  order  to  please  thee,  I  will  put  to  death  one  who  does 
not  deserve  the  penalty,  or  will  pardon  one  who  merits  death. 
I  will  reduce  a  rich  man  to  poverty,  or  'cause  a  pauper  to  be 
made  wealthy.  I  and  all  those  who  belong  to  me  are  thy 
obedient  servants.  I  shall  never  oppose  thy  will,  O  Queen. 
If  I  can  please  thee  even  at  the  cost  of  my  life,  thou  hast  but 
to  speak.  Well  dost  thou  know  how  much  I  love  thee,  now 
tell  me  what  I  may  do  for  thee. 

"  I  swear  to  accomplish  whatever  thou  desireth.  Know  me 
to  be  monarch  of  a  kingdom  on  which  the  sun  never  sets.  The 
lands  of  Drivira,  Sindhu,  Souvira,  Sourashtra,  Dakshinaputha, 
Vanga,  Anga,  Maghandha,  Matsha,  Kashi  and  Koshala  together 
with  their  abundant  produce  and  wealth  are  ruled  by  me.  If 
thou  desirest  any  of  these,  tell  me. 

"  O  Frail  One,  why  dost  thou  cause  thyself  suffering  ?  Rise, 
rise,  O  Dearest,  what  dost  thou  fear  ?  O  Kaikeyi,  as  the  sun 
dispels  the  mist,  I  will  dispel  thy  fears." 

Thus  nattered  by  the  king,  Kaikeyi  appeared  somewhat 
pacified,  yet  in  order  to  afflict  her  lord,  began  to  utter  bitter 
and  harsh  words. 


174 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

CHAPTER    II 

She  asks  for  the  two  boons  promised  her  by  the  king 

The  queen  addressed  the  great  sovereign,  Dasaratha,  who, 
overcome  with  desire,  was  pierced  by  the  shafts  of  Kama-deva,1 
and  said  :  Neither  am  I  sick  nor  has  any  offered  me  insult.  I 
harbour  a  certain  ambition  which  thou  can'st  fulfil.  If  thou  art 
willing  to  accomplish  this,  then  give  me  thy  solemn  promise 
and  I  will  make  known  its  purport  to  thee." 

The  resplendent  monarch,  agitated  by  desire,  raising  the  head 
of  the  queen  from  the  ground  took  her  in  his  arms  and  answered 
smilingly :  "  O  Fortunate  One,  dost  thou  not  know  that  none 
is  dearer  to  me  than  thou,  saving  that  lion  among  men,  Shri 
Ramachandra.  I  swear  by  the  invincible  Rama,  who  is  even 
dearer  to  me  than  thou,  that  I  will  fulfil  thy  ambition.  O 
Kaikeyi,  I  swear  by  Rama,  without  seeing  whom  I  cannot  live 
one  hour,  that  I  will  execute  thy  desire.  O  Dear  One,  by  my 
oath  I  have  demonstrated  to  thee  the  intensity  of  my  love,  now 
tell  me  what  thou  desirest.  Knowing  the  great  love  I  bear 
for  thee,  have  no  fear ;  by  my  meritorious  deeds  I  declare  to 
thee,  I  will  grant  thee  what  thou  asketh." 

Following  the  instructions  of  Manthara,  knowing  the  fulfil- 
ment of  her  ambition  to  be  at  hand  and  concerned  with  the 
advancement  of  Bharata,  Kaikeyi  spoke  harshly.  Satisfied  with 
the  attitude  of  the  king,  she,  resembling  the  dreadful  god  of 
death,  addressed  him :  "  O  Great  King,  formerly  thou  didst 
promise  me  two  boons  to  which  the  thirty-three  gods  were 
witness.  O  King,  moon,  sun,  ether,  the  planets,  day  and  night, 
the  cardinal  points,  the  universe  and  those  who  inhabit  it,  the 
earth,  the  gandharvas,  the  asuras,  the  spirits  and  other  beings 
are  witness  to  that  promise  given  to  me  by  thee.  O  Ye  Gods, 
listen  with  attention  to  the  boons  which  the  king,  a  lover  of 
truth,  highly  resplendent  and  acquainted  with  the  law  of  duty, 
grants  me." 

The  Queen  Kaikeyi,  praising  the  king,  who  was  overcome 
by  desire  and  ready  to  grant  any  boon,  said  :  "  O  King,  recollect 

1  Kama  or  Kandarpa— The  God  of  Love. 

175  N 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

how  in  the  war  between  the  gods  and  asuras,  thou  didst  fall 
wounded  like  one  dead,  and  I  rescued  thee  by  applying  the 
appropriate  means  ?  On  thy  recovery,  thou  didst  promise  me 
two  boons.  O  Truthful  Monarch,  I  now  eamesdy  desire  these 
two  boons  which  are  in  thy  power  to  grant.  Shouldst  thou, 
despite  thy  promises  given,  not  fulfil  these  desires,  then  I  will 
relinquish  my  life,  dishonoured  by  thee." 

The  queen,  holding  the  king's  mind  subject  by  her  sweet 
words,  resembled  a  hunter  who,  intending  to  slay  a  deer,  lays  a 
snare  for  it.  Then  addressing  the  king  infatuated  with  passion 
and  willing  to  grant  any  boon,  she  said : — 

"ODeva,  hear  me,  I  now  claim  these  two  boons.  Employing 
the  preparations  made  for  Rama's  installation,  let  my  son 
Bharata  be  proclaimed  regent,  this  is  the  first  boon.  The  second 
pledge  granted  me  on  the  battlefield  is  now  also  due  to  be 
fulfilled.  Let  Ramachandia  be  exiled  to  the  forest  for  fourteen 
years,  wearing  a  dress  of  bark,  with  matted  locks  like  a  hermit, 
while  my  son,  Prince  Bharata,  rules  without  hindrance.  This  is 
my  earnest  desire.  Let  me,  this  day,  behold  the  exile  of  Rama. 
O  King,  Protector  of  Truth,  preserve  thy  integrity  and  the 
traditions  of  thy  birth.  The  rishis  declare  that  the  observance 
of  truth  is  the  most  excellent  means  of  attaining  heaven." 


CHAPTER     12 

The  king  suffers  bitterly  at  the  thought  of  sending 
Prince  Rama  into  exile 

The  harsh  words  of  Queen  Kaikeyi  caused  intense  suffering 
and  agitation  to  the  heart  of  the  king.  He  began  to  reflect 
— "Am  I  seeing  a  dream  by  day,  is  my  mind  unhinged,  am  I 
possessed  by  an  evil  spirit,  is  an  inauspicious  star  causing  me 
distress  or  is  this  disturbance  the  result  of  some  malady  ?  " 

Pondering  awhile,  the  king  grew  calm,  but  his  mind  was  still 
troubled,  and,  recollecting  the  demands  of  Queen  Kaikeyi,  he 
176 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

again  became  restless  and  agitated  like  a  deer  in  the  presence 
of  a  lioness.  Heaving  deep  sighs,  seated  on  the  ground,  he 
resembled  a  highly  venomous  snake  hypnotized  by  the  power 
of  a  mantram.  He  cried  out  in  anger,  "  Woe  unto  me  "  and 
fell  senseless. 

After  a  long  time,  he  recovered  consciousness,  and  suffering 
great  distress,  full  of  wrath,  answered  Kaikeyi,  while  his 
glance  seemed  as  if  it  would  consume  her.  "  O  Thou  of  Evil 
Disposition,  O  Destroyer  of  my  Dynasty,  what  harm  have  Shri 
Ramachandra  or  I  done  to  thee  ?  Rama  has  ever  treated  thee 
as  his  own  mother.  Why  hast  thou  determined  thus  ?  Alas ! 
I  brought  thee  to  my  house  for  the  destruction  of  my  home. 
I  deemed  thee  to  be  the  daughter  of  a  king  and  thou  hast 
shown  thyself  to  be  a  venomous  serpent.  All  my  people  unite 
in  praise  of  Rama.  For  what  fault  shall  I  abandon  him  ?  It 
were  possible  for  me  to  part  with  Queen  Kaushalya,  Sumitra, 
my  kingdom,  even  life  itself,  but  I  cannot  abandon  Shri  Rama. 
To  behold  the  heir-apparent  causes  delight  to  my  heart ;  when 
not  contemplating  him,  my  mind  loses  its  capacity  to  act.  The 
world  may  continue  to  exist  without  the  sun,  crops  may  grow 
without  water,  but  I  cannot  live  even  for  a  little  while  without 
Shri  Ramachandra. 

"  Therefore,  O  Sinful  One,  give  up  thine  arrogance.  See,  I 
put  my  head  at  thy  feet,  be  gracious  to  me.  Why  hast  thou 
determined  on  this  cruelty,  O  Wicked  One  ?  If  thou  desireth 
to  test  my  love  for  Prince  Bharata,  then  do  so.  When  thou  didst 
say  betimes  that  Rama,  my  eldest  son,  was  entitled  to  the 
kingdom  on  account  of  his  virtues,  didst  thou  utter  these  words 
in  flattery  to  gratify  me  or  to  exact  some  service  of  Rama  ? 

"  The  tidings  of  Rama's  installation  is  causing  thee  a  burning 
discontent.  Possessed  by  an  evil  spirit,  thou  art  not  thyself, 
I  wean.  O  Devi,  it  is  a  great  calamity  that  the  House  of 
Ikshwaku,  famed  for  its  probity,  should  fall  into  disrepute. 

"  Hadst  thou  not  been  afflicted  by  an  evil  spirit  or  influenced 
by  an  inauspicious  planet,  thou  wouldst  never  have  spoken  to 
the  detriment  of  others.  It  is  certain  that  thou  art  possessed 
by  a  malignant  entity.  O  Child,  thou  hast  often  said  that  thou 
didst  love  Shri  Ramachandra,  even  as  Bharata  himself.  O  Devi, 
how  dost  thou  dare  to  seek  the  banishment  of  Ramachandra 
177 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

for  fourteen  years  ?  How  canst  thou  demand  the  exile  of  the 
virtuous  and  tender  Ramachandra  for  fourteen  long  years? 
O  Thou  of  beautiful  eyes,  how  canst  thou  think  of  sending 
Rama  into  exile,  who  ever  honours  thee  ?  Rama  has  paid  thee 
greater  respect  than  Bharata.  I  fail  to  comprehend  how  thou 
canst  desire  his  exile.  Reflect  well,  none  in  the  world  will  offer 
thee  greater  service,  respect  and  obedience  than  Rama. 

"  Among  the  thousands  of  women  and  maid-servants  in  my 
private  apartments,  none  ever  speaks  ill  of  Rama,  and  he 
with  a  pure  heart  offers  protection  to  every  living  being,  while 
his  subjects  ever  love  and  obey  him.  He  has  won  the  hearts 
of  all  beings  by  protecting  the  interests  of  the  needy  and  the 
afflicted.  Generosity,  faithful  service  to  his  preceptor,  valour 
in  the  field  of  battle,  skill  in  archery,  have  all  contributed  to  his 
renown.  Truth,  austerity,  friendship,  purity,  simplicity  of  life, 
knowledge  of  philosophy  and  service  of  his  teacher  are  well- 
known  qualities  of  Shri  Ramachandra. 

"  O  Devi,  Shri  Ramachandra  ever  acting  in  the  highest 
interests  of  all,  equal  to  the  maharishis  and  the  gods  in 
enlightenment,  must  not  suffer  the  ills  of  exile.  Shri  Rama  has 
never  spoken  a  harsh  word  to  any,  how  shall  I  then,  at  thy 
instigation,  give  him  this  pitiless  message  ?  What  shall  befall 
me  bereft  of  Rama  who  is  endowed  with  forgiveness,  gratitude, 
self-control,  renunciation,  truth  and  virtue,  and  who  never 
inflicts  pain  on  any  human  being  ? 

"  O  Kaikeyi,  I  have  grown  old  and  my  end  is  near.  In  this 
wretched  state  I  beseech  thee  to  show  mercy  on  me.  The  earth 
girdled  by  the  sea,  and  all  that  is  contained  therein,  shall  be 
thine.  Why  dost  thou  drive  me  to  the  brink  of  death's  dark 
abyss? 

"  O  Kaikeyi,  I  touch  thy  feet  in  supplication.  Protect  Shri 
Ramachandra  and  save  me  from  dishonouring  my  word." 

King  Dasaratha,  stricken  with  grief,  fell  senseless,  his  whole 
frame  convulsed  and  agitated.  Again  and  again  he  entreated 
the  queen  to  take  him  beyond  the  sea  of  suffering,  but  that 
cruel  one  growing  each  instant  more  adamant,  replied :  "  O 
King,  if  thou  repent  of  the  two  boons  given  to  me,  none  in 
the  world  will  call  thee  righteous.  When  other  kings  question 
thee  regarding  thy  promises,  O  Righteous  One,  what  will  be 
178 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

thine  answer  ?  Wilt  thou  say  that  she  to  whom  thou  owest  thy 
life  and  by  whose  grace  thou  yet  livest,  who  rendered  thee  great 
service  at  the  tune  of  misfortune  and  to  whom  thou  didst  promise 
two  boons,  has  now  been  refused  these  blessings  ? 

"Assuredly  thou  shalt  become  a  stigma  on  the  illustrious 
dynasty  of  Ikshwaku,  having  given  promises  from  which  thou 
now  wouldst  fain  withdraw.  Recollect  King  Shivya,  who 
gave  the  flesh  of  his  own  body,  to  redeem  a  pledge,  was  of  thy 
royal  house.  King  Alarfca,  likewise  of  thy  dynasty,  plucked  out 
his  eyes  that  the  sight  of  an  aged  and  learned  brahmin  might 
be  restored,  and  thus  obtained  the  highest  state.  Not  only  man 
is  bound  by  his  word,  the  ocean  whose  boundaries  are  fixed, 
does  not  pass  beyond  the  shore.  Therefore,  recollecting  thy 
pledge,  do  not  relinquish  it.  O  King,  art  thou  bereft  of  thy 
senses  ?  Abandoning  truth,  thou  wouldst  grant  Rama  the 
kingdom  so  that  thou  mayest  enjoy  the  embraces  of  Queen 
Kaushalya.  Be  it  in  accord  with  dharma  or  not,  be  it  truth 
or  falsehood,  thou  must  fulfil  the  promise  made  to  me,  it  shall 
never  be  revoked. 

"  Shouldst  thou  withdraw  thy  pledge  and  grant  Ramachandra 
the  kingdom,  I  will  give  up  my  life  by  drinking  deadly  poison. 
Were  I  to  see  Queen  Kaushalya  receiving  salutations  as  chief 
queen,  I  should  not  be  able  to  endure  it. 

"  O  Great  Sovereign,  I  swear  by  Bharata  and  my  own  life 
that  nothing  save  the  exile  of  Rama  shall  satisfy  me.** 

After  speaking  these  words,  Kaikeyi  became  silent,  disregard- 
ing the  supplications  of  the  afflicted  monarch.  Understanding 
the  full  portent  of  the  harsh  words  of  Kaikeyi,  implying  Rama's 
exile  and  the  rulership  of  Bharata,  the  king  remained  silent  for 
a  long  time.  His  senses  numbed,  he  gazed  steadfastly  at  the 
face  of  his  beloved  queen,  speaking  thus  bitterly. 

Maharajah  Dasaratha,  afflicted  on  hearing  the  threatening 
speech  of  Kaikeyi  resembling  a  thunderbolt,  inspiring  pain  and 
grief,  knowing  she  had  resolved  to  banish  Rama,  cried  out :  "  O 
Rama  !  Rama  !  "  and  heaving  deep  sighs  fell  to  the  earth  like 
a  felled  tree.  Like  a  madman  bereft  of  sense  or  as  one  in 
delirium  or  a  snake  hypnotized  by  incantations,  he  fell,  deprived 
of  his  glory.  In  abject  tones,  he  addressed  Kaikeyi,  saying : 
"  Who  has  instructed  thee  in  this  evil  design,  cloaked  in  specious 
179 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

garb  ?  Art  thou  not  ashamed  to  address  me  as  one  possessed  ? 
Formerly,  I  did  not  deem  thee  capable  of  such  conduct ;  in 
youth,  thy  disposition  was  otherwise.  What  has  overpowered 
thee  that  thou  seekest  such  a  boon  ?  Stay  these  unjust  words 
that  Rama  should  go  to  the  forest  and  Bharata  occupy  the 
throne.  O  Sinful  One,  O  Cruel-hearted  One,  O  Evil  Doer, 
relinquish  the  insistence  on  thy  resolve,  for  thine  own  sake  and 
for  the  sake  of  thy  subjects  and  thy  son.  Either  Rama  or  I 
must  have  offended  thee.  How  have  we  done  so,  that  thou 
speakest  thus  ?  Assuredly  Prince  Bharata  will  never  wish  to 
occupy  the  throne  while  Rama  lives.  I  deem  Bharata  no  less 
virtuous  than  Ramachandra.  When  instructing  Rama  to  go  to 
the  forest,  seeing  him  stricken,  how  can  I  look  on  him  ?  How 
can  I  look  upon  his  face  darkened  like  the  moon  in  eclipse  ? 
How  can  I  revoke  that  decision  made  in  consultation  with  my 
ministers  and  friends  desiring  my  welfare,  causing  confusion, 
as  the  sudden  smiting  of  an  army  by  the  enemy.  What  will 
the  kings  of  other  lands  say  when  they  hear  the  breaking 
of  my  resolve  which  was  reached  by  common  consent  ?  Will 
they  not  say :  '  King  Dasaratha  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku  is 
like  a  child.  We  marvel  that  he  has  ruled  so  long.'  When 
the  aged,  wise  and  learned  brahmins  enquire  for  Rama,  shall  I 
answer  them  that,  coerced  by  Kaikeyi,  I  have  sent  him  into 
exile  ?  If  I  say  this  in  truth,  it  will  be  accounted  falsehood 
since  I  have  already  instructed  my  Guru  to  install  Shri  Rama 
as  regent.  What  will  his  mother,  Queen  Kaushalya,  say,  if  I 
banish  Rama  ?  How  shall  I  explain  this  cruel  deed  to  Queen 
Kaushalya?  She  is  ever  dutiful,  a  friend,  serving  me  as  a 
handmaid,  keeping  my  secrets  as  a  trusted  companion,  practising 
virtue  like  a  woman  and  in  attending  on  my  welfare  resembling 
a  sister,  serving  me  with  delicious  food  like  a  mother,  ever 
speaking  sweetly  to  me,  ever  desiring  my  good;  her  son  is 
dearest  to  me.  How  can  I  fail  to  accord  her  due  respect  ? 
Fearing  thy  displeasure,  how  great  would  be  my  subsequent 
repentance  and  remorse  ? 

"As  one  partaking  of  delicious  food,  really  injurious  to  him, 

is  later  filled  with  regret,  so  knowing  Rama  exiled  at  my 

command,  the  terrified  Sumitra  will  place  no  further  faith  in 

me.    Oh !  how  unfortunate  is  this,  that  Sita  hearing  these  evil 

1 80 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

tidings  of  my  death  and  Shii  Ramachandra's  banishment,  will 
yield  up  her  life,  as  a  nymph  dies  deprived  of  her  mate  in  a 
Himalayan  valley. 

"  I  shall  not  long  survive  the  exile  of  Rama  and  the  grief  of 
Sita.  Enjoy  thou  the  kingdom  with  thy  son,  but  as  a  widow ! 
Know  well,  O  Devi,  there  is  no  happiness  for  me  in  life  if  Rama 
is  exiled.  As  men  infatuated  by  the  colour  of  wine,  drink 
it  thinking  ill  of  it  the  while  and  knowing  its  harmful 
consequences,  so  did  I,  charmed  by  thee,  enter  into  union  with 
thee,  believing  thee  true  and  faithful.  Yet  now  I  know  thy 
disposition  to  be  incomparably  vile.  Thou  hast  deluded  me 
with  alluring  deceits. 

"As  a  hunter  decoys  a  deer  by  sweet  music,  so  alas !  will 
the  people  of  the  capital  think  of  me,  as  my  son's  executioner. 
They  will  shrink  from  me  as  from  a  brahmin  who  drinks 
intoxicating  liquor.  Alas !  that  I  should  hear  such  bitter 
words.  Now  I  am  suffering  deep  affliction  as  men  who  consume 
the  fruit  of  their  former  iniquities.  O  Sinful  One,  having  long 
protected  thee,  it  is  I  who  have  erred,  like  the  man  who  carefully 
preserves  the  rope  with  which  he  is  eventually  hanged. 

"As  a  child,  in  a  solitary  place,  plays  with  a  black  snake  not 
knowing  it  will  be  the  cause  of  his  death,  so  am  I.  Who  is 
more  wicked  than  myself,  who,  during  my  lifetime  causes  my 
saintly  son  to  become  an  orphan  ?  The  whole  world  will  despise 
me  saying :  *  King  Dasaratha  is  overcome  by  lust  and  at  the 
prompting  of  a  woman  has  sent  his  son  into  exile.' 

"  Shri  Rama  in  his  childhood  abstained  from  flesh,  honey1 
and  wine,  and  faithful  to  his  brahmacharya  vow,  was  reduced 
to  a  skeleton  by  the  observance  of  severe  austerities,  much  study 
and  the  firm  service  of  his  preceptor.  Now,  a  householder, 
the  time  has  come  that  he  should  enjoy  health  and  prosperity, 
yet  now  he  is  condemned  to  undergo  great  physical  privation. 
It  is  certain  when  I  command  him  to  go  to  the  forest,  he  will 
reply  *  Be  it  so,  O  Sire*.  Alas!  how  much  better  if  it  could  be 
otherwise.  My  beloved  child  will  assuredly  not  disobey  me. 
Not  knowing  my  true  reason,  and  believing  the  command  to 
spring  from  the  sincerity  of  my  heart,  he  will  acquiesce  and 

1  Honey  in  those  days  being  obtained  by  killing  all  die  bees,  hence  Shri  Rama

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

willingly  depart ;    yet  all  will  execrate  me  if  Rama  leaves  us. 

"  Death,  who  spares  none,  will  take  me  to  the  region  of  Yama 
while  Shri  Ramachandra  has  gone  to  the  forest,  then  O  Kaikeyi, 
what  grievous  injustice  wilt  thou  inflict  on  thy  remaining 
relatives  and  Queen  Kaushalya  ?  She,  deprived  of  Rama  and 
Lakshmana,  will  no  longer  be  able  to  endure  her  grief  and  will 
yield  up  her  life. 

"  O  Kaikeyi,  having  cast  me,  Kaushalya,  Sumitra  and  my 
three  sons  into  the  pit  of  death,  canst  thou  be  happy  ?  Wilt 
thou  be  able  to  protect  the  dynasty  of  Ikshwaku,  which  for 
long  ages  has  been  ruled  without  disturbance,  when  Rama  and 
I  are  gone  ?  Will  Bharata  approve  the  banishment  of  Rama, 
if  it  be  so,  let  him  not  perform  my  obsequies.  O  Enemy,  may 
thine  ambitions  be  fulfilled.  When  I  am  dead  and  Rama 
banished,  then  wilt  thou,  a  widow,  govern  the  kingdom  with 
thy  son. 

"  O  Thou  dwelling  in  our  midst  as  the  pretended  daughter 
of  a  king,  wert  thou  truly  a  princess,  thine  incomparable  renown 
would  not  have  been  tarnished,  nor  would  I  have  been  set  at 
nought  by  thee. 

"  Now  my  son,  accustomed  to  ride  on  chariots,  horses  and 
elephants  will  have  to  walk  barefoot  in  the  forest.  He,  who 
formerly  was  served  at  table  by  attendants  in  jewelled  livery, 
each  vying  with  the  other,  saying:  'My  dish  is  sweeter,  O 
Lord,'  how  shall  that  Rama  henceforth  live  on  the  bitter  and 
insipid  fruits  of  the  forest  ?  How  shall  he  pass  his  life  depen- 
dent on  fruit  and  roots  ?  How  shall  Shri  Ramachandra, 
accustomed  to  costly  apparel  and  a  luxurious  couch,  sleep  on  the 
bare  ground,  clothed  in  the  yellow  robe  of  a  mendicant  ?  I 
know  not  why  an  evil-minded  woman  should  issue  this  cruel 
decree  that  Rama  should  be  exiled  and  Bharata  be  installed  as 
regent. 

"  Woe  unto  those  women  seeking  material  gain,  skilful  in 
accomplishing  their  own  purpose !  I  do  not  condemn  all 
women,  but  those  like  the  mother  of  Bharata.  O  Kaikeyi, 
versed  in  wrong  doing,  ever  meanly  disposed  and  seeking  thine 
own  advantage,  didst  thou  enter  my  house  to  cause  me  affliction  ? 
What  fault  hast  thou  seen  in  me  or  in  Ramachandra,  the  friend 
of  all  the  world  ?  O  Kaikeyi,  on  seeing  Rama  suffering  in  the 
182 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

forest  at  thy  request,  fathers  will  abandon  their  sons,  faithful 
wives  their  husbands,  and  the  whole  world  will  condemn 
thee. 

"  When  I  behold  Shri  Ramachandra  adorned  and  handsome 
as  a  god,  approaching  me,  my  eyes  axe  delighted ;  seeing  him 
thus,  I  am  rilled  with  joy  and  courage.  The  affairs  of  the  world 
may  continue  in  the  absence  of  the  dawn,  and  the  earth  exist 
without  rain,  evoked  by  Indra,  but  none  in  the  capital  will  enjoy 
happiness  beholding  Rama  going  into  exile. 

"Alas  !  To-day,  I  am  about  to  perish  for  long  nursing  thee 
in  my  arms,  O  Kaikeyi,  a  venomous  snake  bent  on  my 
destruction.  Thou  art  my  real  enemy.  Now  do  thou,  Rama 
and  Lakshmana  perform  my  funeral  ceremonies,  then  govern 
the  kingdom  with  thy  son,  Bharata.  Destroy  my  relatives  and 
friends,  depopulate  my  towns  and  country,  and  live  in  accord 
with  mine  enemies,  O  Thou  Cruel  Wretch !  Why  do  thy  teeth 
not  break  into  a  thousand  fragments,  seeing  thou  hast  spoken 
improperly  before  thy  lord,  and  uttered  vain  boasts.  Never  did 
my  Rama  speak  an  unkind  word  to  thee.  He  knows  not  how 
to  speak  unkindly.  Thou  chargest  Rama  with  baseness,  who 
ever  was  of  gentle  speech  and  who  is  endowed  with  every 
excellent  quality. 

"  O  Thou  Defamer  of  the  Kingdom  of  Kaikeya,  I  shall  not 
grant  thy  request  whether  thou  be  angered  or  sorrowful  or 
takest  thy  life  by  swallowing  poison  or  dasheth  thy  head  against  & 
rock,  or  even  sinkest  into  the  earth.  Thou  utterest  words  keen 
as  the  edge  of  a  razor,  deceitful  and  heartrending,  veiling  them 
in  gentle  accents,  thy  nature  is  perverse,  thou  art  the  destroyer 
of  thine  own  family.  Thou  hast  inflicted  bitter  agony  on  me. 
Though  charming  in  looks,  thou  art  a  dangerous  woman. 
I  do  not  desire  to  consort  with  one  so  surpassingly  wicked. 

"  What  use  to  speak  of  love  and  joy,  I  cannot  live  without 
Ramachandra.  O  Devi,  abstain  from  destroying  me.  I  touch 
thy  feet,  be  gracious  to  me." 

Finding  her  heart  unmoved  by  his  appeal,  King  Dasaratha 
like  an  orphan,  fawning  and  abject,  fell  unconscious  at  the  feet 
of  Kaikeyi  as  one  about  to  die. 


183 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     13 

Kaikeyi  disregards  the  king's  immeasurable  distress 

King  Dasaratha  lying  on  the  ground  in  utter  ignominy, 
resembled  King  Yayati  fallen  from  heaven.  The  cruel  queen, 
seeing  her  purpose  yet  unaccomplished,  herself  fearless  yet 
inspiring  terror  in  the  heart  of  the  king,  again  demanded  the 
boons,  saying : — 

"  O  King,  thou  didst  ever  deem  thyself  a  man  of  truth  and 
one  faithful  to  his  vows,  why  dost  thou  then  withhold  the  boons 
promised  to  me  ?  " 

After  some  time,  the  monarch  exceedingly  disquieted,  replied 

in  anger : — 

"  O  Sinful  Woman,  after  my  death  when  Ramachandra,  the 
chief  of  men,  has  gone  into  exile,  thou  mayest  accomplish  thy 
purpose.  In  heaven,  the  gods  will  enquire  concerning  the 
welfare  of  Shri  Ramachandra.  If  I  reply  that  I  have  sent  Rama 
into  exile  to  please  Kaikeyi,  it  will  be  looked  upon  as  a  falsehood, 
and  none  will  believe  it.  Having  passed  innumerable  years 
without  a  son,  how  should  I,  after  long  suffering  and  anxiety, 
being  blessed  with  an  heir,  forsake  the  long-armed  Rama  ? 

"  How  can  Rama,  valorous,  learned,  tolerant  and  forbearing, 
whose  eyes  are  like  lotuses,  be  driven  into  exile  by  me  ?  How 
should  I  send  the  beautiful  Rama,  whose  complexion  is  like 
the  blue  lotus,  to  the  Dandaka  forest  ?  Shri  Rama,  meriting 
every  comfort  and  pleasure,  undeserving  of  sorrow,  how  can  I 
behold  that  wise  Ramachandra  in  distress  ? 

"  Had  I  died  without  seeing  Rama  afflicted,  who  merits  no 
suffering  whatsoever,  my  spirit  would  have  experienced  joy  in 
heaven.  O  Pitiless,  O  Sinful  Kaikeyi,  why,  why  dost  thou 
compel  me  to  send  my  dear  and  truthful  son,  Shri  Ramachandra, 
to  the  forest  ?  I  shall  incur  dishonour  throughout  the  whole 
world." 

Thus  lamenting  and  distracted,  evening  having  fallen  and 
the  night  creeping  on  apace,  King  Dasaratha  afflicted  and  in 
great  anguish,  experienced  no  delight  on  beholding  the  moon. 
184 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

The  old  king,  sighing  heavily,  continued  to  lament,  and  gazing 
at  the  starry  sky  cried :  "  O  Night,  adorned  with  stars,  do  not 
pass  into  the  dawn.  O  Auspicious  Night,  with  great  humility, 
I  supplicate  thee,  have  pity  on  me  and  do  not  pass  away.  I 
have  no  desire  to  behold  the  face  of  this  cruel  "Kaikeyi,  who  has 
caused  me  immeasurable  distress." 

Then  the  monarch  again  entreated  Kaikeyi  saying :  "  A 
virtuous  man  and  yet  wretched,  I  take  refuge  in  thee,  for  I  have 
only  a  short  while  to  live.  O  Auspicious  One  !  Know  this  ; 
I  am  a  king  and  not  alone  but  in  the  royal  assembly  have  X 
proclaimed  Rama  as  regent.  Be  gracious  unto  me,  O  Kaikeyi, 
O  Child,  O  Giver  of  Delight !  Grant  imperishable  rulership 
to  Shri  Ramachandra  and  endear  thyself  to  me.  O  Kaikeyi, 
thus  shalt  thou  obtain  great  renown. 

"  O  Thou  of  beautiful  face,  let  Rama  be  installed,  so  shalt 
thou  cause  pleasure  to  Shri  Ramachandra,  to  Bharata,  to  the 
court,  nay  to  the  whole  world." 

Then  the  pure-hearted  sovereign,  his  eyes  reddened  in  his 
distress  burst  into  a  flood  of  tears,  but  the  wicked  Kaikeyi 
disregarded  both  his  flattery  and  his  weeping. 

The  king,  realising  the  exile  of  Shri  Rama  could  not  be  avoided, 
tell  senseless  to  the  earth.  Signing  deeply  at  every  moment, 
King  Dasaratha  passed  the  night  in  great  anguish. 

At  dawn,  the  royal  musicians  striking  up  to  awaken  the  great 
monarch,  were  ordered  by  him  to  be  silent. 


chapter    14 

The  king  is  overcome  by  grief  ;  the  queen  summons  Shri  Rama 

KAIKEYI  beholding  the  king  distracted  with  suffering,  undecided 
how  to  act,  and  restless  as  a  fish  on  dry  land,  said : — 

"  O  King,  what  is  the  meaning  of  thy  grief  and  sorrow  ? 

Having  promised  me  two  boons,  wilt  thou  incur  the  sin  of 

default  ?    Those  versed  in  the  secret  of  righteousness,  call  truth 

the  essence  of  virtue.    I  ask  thee  but  to  protect  truth  for  thine 

185 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

own  good.  O  King,  in  ancient  times,  thy  forbear,  King  Shivya 
fulfilled  a  promise  given,  by  yielding  up  his  body  to  a  hawk 
and  thus  acquired  a  high  spiritual  state.  Thus  also  the  illustri- 
ous Alarka  gladly  taking  out  his  own  eyes  gave  them  to  a  blind 
brahmin  versed  in  the  Veda.  The  Lord  of  Waters,  the  ocean, 
paying  due  regard  to  truth,  does  not  pass  beyond  its  boundaries 
at  the  time  of  the  full  moon.  Truth  is  Brahman.  Truth  is 
the  crown  of  righteousness.  The  imperishable  Veda  proclaims 
the  glory  of  truth.  When  the  heart  is  purified  by  the  practice 
of  truth,  Brahman  is  realised.  O  King,  if  thou  holdest  truth 
to  be  the  fruit  of  virtue,  then  following  truth  grant  me  the  two 
boons,  O  Bestower  of  Boons.  For  the  sake  of  safeguarding  thy 
future  happiness,  send  Rama  into  exile  !  Send  Rama  into  exile 
at  my  request.  Thrice  I  repeat  my  desire.  If  thou  failest  to 
exile  Rama,  I  shall  not  survive  the  dishonour  and  shall  yield  up 
my  life  in  thy  presence." 

Hearing  the  words  of  Kaikeyi,  King  Dasaratha  found  himself 
bound  and  unable  to  escape,  like  King  Bali  of  old  in  the  presence 
of  Vamana.1  Distraught,  his  mind  agitated,  his  countenance 
pallid,  the  king  resembled  a  bullock  tottering  between  the  yoke 
and  the  wheel.  Anxiety  and  grief  overwhelmed  the  king  ;  with 
a  supreme  effort,  mustering  his  courage  and  controlling  his 
senses,  his  eyes  distended,  he  addressed  Kaikeyi ;  "  O  Sinful 
Woman,  at  the  time  of  our  nuptials,  in  the  presence  of  the 
sacred  flame,  I  took  thy  hand  in  mine,  but  to-day,  I  reject  thee 
and  the  son  born  of  thee,  Prince  Bharata.  O  Devi,  the  night 
is  nearly  passed  and  the  sun  about  to  rise.  My  Guru  and  the 
elders  will  urge  me  to  perform  the  installation  ceremony.  Let 
the  preparations  made  for  the  installation  be  used  for  my  funeral 
rites.  Let  no  part  therein  be  taken  by  thee,  O  Kaikeyi,  as  thou 
dost  oppose  the  installation  of  Shri  Rama.  How  shall  I  look 
upon  the  faces  of  these  people  now  filled  with  joy  in  anticipation 
of  Rama's  enthronement,  that  will  soon  become  overcast  and 
melancholy  ?  " 

The  night  illumined  by  the  moon  and  stars  passed  away  as 
the  King  was  speaking,  and  day  dawned.  Then  Kaikeyi, 
eloquent  in  speech  but  full  of  iniquity,  transported  with  anger, 
spoke  passionately : — 

1  Vamana — The  holy  Dwarf,  a  divine  Incarnation. 

186 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

"  O  King,  why  dost  thou  speak  like  one  affected  by  a  grave 
disease?  Send  for  thy  son  Ramachandra  to  come  hither. 
Install  my  son  on  the  throne  and  send  Rama  into  exile.  Then 
shalt  thou  have  accomplished  thy  duty." 

The  king,  like  a  well-bred  horse  smarting  under  the  lash, 
replied :  "  I  am  caught  in  the  net  of  dharma,  I  am  bereft  of 
understanding,  let  me  behold  my  eldest  son,  Shri  Rama." 

The  morning  had  now  dawned,  and  the  night  had  fled ;  the 
sun  had  risen  and  an  auspicious  planet  was  in  the  ascendant. 
The  blessed  Lord  Vasishtha  endowed  with  every  excellent 
quality,  surrounded  by  his  disciples,  holding  the  sacred  articles 
required  for  the  installation,  came  to  the  great  door.  Passing 
through  the  capital,  Shri  Vasishtha  observed  the  streets  swept 
and  watered.  Flags  were  fluttering  everywhere  in  the  breeze, 
flowers  of  many  kinds  were  strewn  on  the  roads  and  garlands 
hung  here  and  there.  All  the  inhabitants  looked  happy ;  shops 
and  stalls  displayed  a  variety  of  merchandise,  while  incense 
mixed  with  ambergris  and  sandalwood  perfumed  the  ah*.  Every- 
where people  were  celebrating  the  festival  and  eagerly  awaiting 
the  coronation  of  Ramachandra. 

Having  passed  through  the  city  of  Ayodhya,  which  resembled 
Amaravati,  Shri  Vasishtha  came  to  the  royal  palace,  and  beheld 
at  the  gate  an  assembly  of  brahmins  and  teachers  who  enhanced 
the  scene.  Innumerable  priests,  skilled  in  the  ritual  of  sacrifice, 
courtiers  and  leaders  of  the  warrior  class,  as  well  as  merchants 
were  gathered  there.  Shri  Vasishtha  penetrated  to  the  private 
apartments  and  delightedly  entered  there.  At  the  door  he 
beheld  the  charioteer  Sumantra  of  pleasing  looks  and  the  holy 
sage  begged  him  to  announce  his  arrival  to  the  king  and  inform 
his  majesty  that  he  had  brought  the  sacred  water  of  the  Gunga 
in  golden  vessels,  and  various  seeds,  fragrant  herbs  and  gems  of 
different  kinds.  There  was  also  honey,  curds,  clarified  butter, 
parched  rice,  kusba  grass,  flowers  and  milk,  together  with 
eight  beautiful  virgins  and  a  white  elephant,  A  chariot  drawn 
by  four  horses,  an  excellent  sword  and  bow,  a  palanquin  with 
bearers  and  a  canopy  resembling  the  moon  in  purity.  Two 
white  chamaras,  a  narrow-necked  jar  of  gold,  white  heifers, 
a  lion  with  great  teeth,  a  fine  steed,  a  lion  throne,  a  tiger  skin, 
sacrificial  fuel  and  fire.  Musicians  of  every  kind,  beautifully 
187 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

adorned  women  singers,  teachers,  priests,  cows,  deer  and  birds  ; 
representatives  of  the  people  and  merchants  with  their  families 
were  gathered  there.  These  and  many  people  inspired  by 
affection  and  of  gentle  speech,  had  come  with  their  leaders 
to  see  the  coronation  of  Rama. 

Shri  Vasishtha  ordered  Sumantra  to  inform  the  king  with 
all  haste  that  Rama  should  be  installed  when  the  Fushya  star 
was  in  the  ascendant.  Sumantra  instructed  by  the  royal  Sage 
Vasishtha,  and  having  access  to  the  person  of  the  king,  entered 
the  palace  crying  "  Jai !  Jai !  to  his  majesty  ".  The  guards 
permitted  him  to  enter  without  hindrance,  and  Sumantra, 
approaching  the  king,  ignorant  of  his  condition,  began  to  praise 
his  royal  master,  according  to  the  prevailing  custom.  With 
great  humility  he  addressed  him,  saying :  "  O  Gracious  Sover- 
eign, as  the  sun  at  the  breaking  of  day  gives  pleasure  to  the  sea, 
so  do  thou  give  us  joy  by  thy  radiant  countenance.  Add  to  our 
delight,  O  Mighty  Lord  !  As  in  the  morning  Indra  was  adored 
by  his  charioteer,  whereafter  he  defeated  the  asuras,  so  do  I 
salute  thee.  I  come  to  wake  thee  as  the  Vidyas  and  Vedas 
waken  Brahma.  As  sun  and  moon  stimulate  the  earth  which 
supports  all  men  and  life,  so  do  I  come  to  waken  thee,  O  Great 
Ruler.  Awake,  O  Maharaj  and  rejoice  the  hearts  of  the  people 
by  thy  sight.  Don  thy  royal  robes  and  adorn  thyself  with  the 
great  gems,  resplendent  like  the  sun  on  the  crest  of  Mount 
Mem.  O  Sire,  may  the  Moon,  the  Sun,  Shiva  and  Kuvera 
be  auspicious  to  thee.  May  Varuna,  Agni  and  Indra  grant  thee 
success.  The  lovely  night  has  passed  and  the  auspicious  day 
has  dawned.  O  Royal  Sage,  arise  and  perform  thy  duties ; 
preparations  for  the  installation  of  Rama  are  completed,  the 
leading  citizens  and  the  inhabitants  of  the  capital  are  waiting 
in  reverence  at  the  gate ;  the  blessed  Sage  Vasishtha,  with  his 
disciples,  is  at  the  door.  Command  us,  O  King,  to  inaugurate 
the  coronation  of  Rama  immediately ;  as  cattle  without  a 
keeper,  an  army  without  a  general,  night  without  the  moon, 
cows  without  a  bull,  so  is  thy  kingdom  without  a  king 
to-day." 

The  king  hearing  the  peaceful  words  of  Sumantra  was 
once  more  submerged  in  the  sea  of  sorrow ;    though  over- 
come with  grief,  his  eyes  red  with  wrath,  he  answered  him : 
188 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

"  O  Sumantra,  thy  words  of  praise  inflict  great  pain  on  me." 

Sumantra,  beholding  the  miserable  condition  of  his  master, 
and  hearing  his  anguished  words,  joining  his  palms  in  submission, 
stepped  backwards,  tongue-tied. 

Then  Kaikeyi,  skilled  in  achieving  her  own  purpose,  addressed 
Sumantra  :  "  O  Sumantra,  being  overjoyed  on  account  of  the 
installation  of  his  son,  the  king  has  not  slept  this  night.  Being 
fatigued,  he  is  now  overcome  with  sleep.  Go  thou,  therefore, 
and  bring  the  illustrious  Ramachandra  hither ;  this  matter 
requires  no  deliberation." 

Sumantra  reflected  that  the  arrival  of  Shri  Ramachandra 
would  pacify  the  mind  of  the  king :  he  speedily  went  to  summon 
him  and  on  the  way  reflected,  "  Why  has  Queen  Kaikeyi 
summoned  Rama  in  haste  ?  "  The  charioteer  believed  the 
eagerness  of  the  king  had  prompted  him  to  summon  Shri 
Ramachandra  for  the  purpose  of  his  installation.  Sumantra, 
happily  came  to  the  beautiful  palace  of  Shri  Rama  which 
resembled  a  small  island  in  the  sea,  and  beheld  there  many 
people  standing  at  the  gate. 

He  beheld  many  kings  and  great  chieftains  assembled  in  their 
allotted  places. 


CHAPTER     15 

Sumantra  hurries  to  Prince  Rama's  palace 

When  night  had  given  way  to  the  dawn,  brahmins  well-versed 
in  the  Veda,  together  with  the  king's  priests,  came  to  the  palace 
gate.  With  them  came  the  counsellors,  the  chiefs  of  the  army 
and  leading  merchants  to  witness  the  installation  of  Rama. 

The  sun  having  risen  and  the  Pushya  planet  with  Karrata1 
being  auspicious,'  it  being  the  time  at  which  Rama  was  born, 
brahmins  brought  vessels  of  gold  filled  with  water,  a  finely

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

decorated  throne  and  a  resplendent  chariot  with  a  seat  spread 
with  a  tiger  skin.  Water  was  brought  from  the  confluence  of 
the  Gunga  and  Yamuna  and  from  the  holy  rivers,  lakes  and 
wells,  from  the  westward  flowing  streams  and  those  descending 
from  great  heights  and  flowing  through  the  plains.  From  the 
seas  also  water  was  provided  and  stored  in  shining  vessels  of 
gold  and  silver,  wherein  lotus  blooms  floated  and  on  whose 
surface  sticks  of  Gular1  and  banyan  were  sprinkled. 

Honey,  curds,  clarified  butter,  kusha  grass,  and  flowers  were 
also  provided.  Beautifully  adorned  singing  women  were  like- 
wise present.  Chamaras  with  handles  of  gold  set  with  jewels, 
a  beautiful  canopy,  scintillating  and  round  as  the  moon,  were 
furnished  for  the  ceremony,  also  a  white  caparisoned  steed,  a 
young  elephant  of  great  size,  and  eight  virgins  gracefully  attired. 

Musicians  with  vinas,  bards  and  those  who  proclaim  the 
king's  praise;  everything  required  for  the  installation  of  a 
sovereign  of  the  dynasty  of  Ikshwaku  was  furnished  by  command 
of  the  king.  Not  beholding  King  Dasaratha  at  the  appointed 
time,  those  present  said :  "  Who  will  announce  our  arrival  to 
the  monarch  ?  The  sun  has  risen,  but  the  king  has  not  come 
forth ;  every  preparation  for  the  installation  of  Rama  is  now 
complete." 

While  they  were  thus  speaking,  Sumantra,  honoured  servant 
of  the  state,  addressed  the  royal  guests,  and  maharajahs,  saying : 
"As  commanded  by  the  king,  I  purpose  to  bring  Shri  Rama 
before  him.  On  my  return,  I  will  ask  his  majesty  for  you  who 
are  worthy  of  honour,  the  reason  for  the  delay." 

The  aged  Sumantra  came  to  the  door  of  the  inner  apartment 
and  entered,  unannounced.  Praising  the  royal  dynasty  of  Raghu, 
he  reached  the  chamber  where  the  king  was  lying  on  the  ground. 
Pouring  forth  his  praise,  he  approached  the  arras  hanging  before 
the  king's  chamber,  and  said :  "  O  Sovereign,  may  Surya, 
Kuvera,  Varuna,  Agni  and  Indra  grant  thee  victory.  The 
Goddess  Night,  has  departed,  dawn  has  come,  arise  O  Lion 
among  Kings  !  Brahmins,  ambassadors  and  chiefs  of  the  forces 
have  assembled  and  are  desirous  of  seeing  thee." 

The  king,  rousing  himself,  said  to  his  chief  minister,  Suman- 
tra:   "Bring  Shri  Ramachandra  hither  speedily.    Why  dost 

>  Gular — Twigs  of  a  fragrant  resinous  tree. 

190 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

thou  delay  ?    I  do  not  sleep,  go  bring  Shri  Rama  with  all  haste." 

Sumantra,  Bowing  to  the  king,  went  forth  to  execute  his 
commands.  Thinking  the  installation  of  Rama  to  be  near,  he 
set  out  for  the  palace,  passing  joyfully  along  the  royal  route 
gay  with  flags  and  banners.  Hearing  on  all  sides,  people 
conversing  of  the  coming  event,  he  mingled  with  the  happy 
throng  and  after  walking  some  distance,  saw  Shri  Rama's 
palace,  white  as  the  peak  of  Mount  Kailasha  and  fair  as  Indra's 
abode. 

The  turrets,  adorned  with  golden  images,  studded  with 
coral  and  jewels,  rendered  the  palace  resplendent,  like  the 
winter  clouds  on  the  caverns  of  Mount  Sumeru.  The  main 
gateway,  decorated  with  wreaths  of  gems  and  pearls,  was 
fragrant  with  sandalwood  and  ambergris,  sweet-scented  like 
the  Malaygiri  mountain  and  abounding  with  cranes  and  pea- 
cocks. The  doors  and  walls  of  the  inner  apartments  were 
decorated  with  paintings  of  lions,  tigers  and  wolves,  pleasing 
to  the  eye  and  mind. 

The  palace  of  Rama,  resplendent  as  the  sun  and  moon, 
furnished  like  the  palace  of  Kuvera  and  equalling  the  abode 
of  Indra,  was  surrounded  by  many  kinds  of  birds  who  sported 
there.  Men  from  distant  lands  in  bejewelled  apparel  waited 
bearing  gifts  in  their  hands,  eager  to  behold  Rama.  The 
spacious  palace  was  sumptuously  furnished  and  the  attendants 
serving  there  were  men  of  small  stature. 

Shri  Sumantra,  delighting  the  people,  in  his  chariot  drawn 
by  horses,  came  to  the  door  of  the  palace  which  was  filled  with 
untold  wealth  and  surrounded  by  deer  and  peacocks  gladdening 
the  heart. 

Entering  the  gates  and  greeting  those  dear  to  Rama,  Sumantra 
reached  the  door  of  the  inner  apartment.  There  also  he  heard 
everyone  conversing  of  Shri  Rama  and  he  rejoiced  to  hear  them 
speaking  of  his  glory.  He  beheld  the  inner  inclosure,  resplen- 
dent and  lofty  as  Mount  Meru,  which  was  rendered  charming 
by  the  presence  of  many  deer  and  birds.  There,  too,  he  beheld 
those  from  various  lands,  descending  from  their  chariots, 
bearing  gifts. 

He  observed  an  elephant  equal  to  a  hill  in  height,  resembling 
a  dark  cloud,  who  had  never  known  the  touch  of  a  goad  and 
191  o

whose  forehead  was  dripping  with  sweat.  Its  name  was 
Shatrunja,  and  it  stood  prepared  to  carry  Rama.  • 

Proceeding  further,  Sumantra  beheld  many  charioteers  and 
horsemen  ready  with  their  caparisoned  horses.  Continuing  on 
his  way,  Shri  Rama's  chief  minister  saw  countless  artists  and 
poets  gathered  there. 

Passing  through  the  multitude,  he  came  to  the  private  apart- 
ment of  Shri  Rama.  Unchallenged,  the  great  Sumantra, 
resembling  a  cloud,  entered  the  apartment  as  a  crocodile  enters 
the  gem-filled  ocean. 


CHAPTER    16 

Shri  Rama  in  Ms  chariot  drives  swiftly  to  the  king 

Passing  through  a  further  doorway,  thronged  with  people, 
Sumantra  came  to  another  gate  where  no  guard  stood.  He 
beheld  there  many  young  men,  alert,  vigilant,  and  devoted  to 
their  master,  armed  with  bows  and  axes,  and  wearing  beautiful 
ear-rings.  Beyond  these,  Sumantra  saw  aged  men,  clad  in  red, 
gorgeously  attired,  holding  staves  in  their  hands,  guarding  the 
apartments  of  the  Queens.  Seeing  the  virtuous  Sumantra 
approaching  with  others,  they  stood  respectfully  at  attention. 

Sumantra,  addressing  these  humble  and  experienced  attend- 
ants, said :  "  Be  pleased  to  inform  Shri  Ramachandra  that 
Sumantra  waits  at  the  door." 

They,  ever  desiring  the  good  of  Rama,  informed  the  prince 
and  Sita  of  the  arrival  of  Sumantra.  Knowing  Sumantra  to  be 
in  the  confidence  of  his  royal  father,  Shri  Rama  affectionately 
caused  him  to  be  summoned. 

The  charioteer,  entering  there,  perceived  Shri  Ramachandra 
resembling  Kuvera  himself,  seated  on  a  golden  couch,  spread 
with  soft  cushions  and  richly  ornamented.  His  brow  was 
anointed  with  pure  and  fragrant  sandalwood-paste,  the  colour 
of  the  blood  of  a  wild  boar. 

By  his  side  the  Princess  Sita,  as  beautiful  as  the  moon  attended 
192 


AYODHYA    KANDA     ■ 

by  the  Chitra1  planet,  was  seated,  holding  a  chamara  in  her 
hand. 

Sumantra,  versed  in  the  customs  of  the  court,  offered  respectful 
salutations  to  Shri  Rama  who  appeared  as  resplendent  as  the 
noonday  sun.  With  joined  palms,  Sumantra  humbly  enquired 
as  to  the  prince's  welfare  and  addressed  him  who  was  thus 
seated  on  the  couch,  saying :  "  O  Excellent  Son  of  Queen 
Kaushalya,  the  king  desires  to  see  thee  in  the  apartment  of 
Queen  Kaikeyi,  be  pleased  to  go  thither  without  delay." 

Thus  addressed,  that  Lion  among  men,  the  most  illustrious 
Ramachandra,  filled  with  joy,  on  receiving  the  summons,  replied : 
"  Be  it  so,  I  will  go  thither  with  all  speed."  Then  turning 
to  Sita,  he  said  :  "  O  Devi,  my  mother  Kaikeyi,  and  my  father 
have  consulted  each  other  concerning  those  matters  relative  to 
my  installation.  O  Princess  of  Beautiful  Eyes,  my  mother 
Kaikeyi,  ever  benevolent  and  accomplished,  knowing  the  king's 
desire,  is  influencing  him  for  my  good  !  That  daughter  of  the 
great  King  of  Kaikeya,  ever  obedient  to  my  royal  father  desires 
my  welfare.  He,  with  his  beloved  queen,  has  sent  for  me 
through  Sumantra,  who  is  ever  well-disposed  to  me,  and  desires 
what  is  pleasing  to  me,  as  does  the  king,  my  sire,  and  the  queen, 
my  mother.  Assuredly,  to-day  the  king  will  proclaim  me  regent. 
I  shall  go  to  my  royal  father  in  all  haste,  do  thou  converse 
happily  with  thy  maids  of  honour." 

Hearing  these  courteous  words,  spoken  by  her  lord,  the 
lotus-eyed  Princess  Sita  reciting  the  Peace  Chant,  followed 
Shri  Ramachandra  to  the  door.  She  said :  "  O  Maharaj,  the 
kingdom  has  many  learned  brahmins  who  will  crown  thee,  as 
Indra  was  crowned  by  Brahma.  When  the  preliminary  initiation 
is  completed  and  thou  dost  perform  the  Rajasuya*  sacrifice  and 
I  behold  thee  dressed  in  an  antelope  skin  with  the  deer's  horns 
in  thy  hand,  do  thou  then  allow  me  to  pay  thee  homage.  May 
Indra  in  the  east  protect  thee,  may  Yama  in  the  south  protect 
thee,  may  Varuna  in  the  west  protect  thee,  may  Kuvera  in  the 
north  protect  thee." 

Having  taken  leave  of  Sita,  Shri  Rama  left  his  palace  with 
Sumantra.    Shri  Rama,  going  forth  from  his  palace,  as  a  lion

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

issues  from  his  cave,  beheld  Shri  Lakshmana  humbly  waiting 
at  the  door. 

At  the  middle  gate,  Shri  Rama  encountered  his  friends  and 
honoured  those  who  had  gathered  there  to  witness  his  coronation. 
Then  that  lion  among  men,  the  son  of  King  Dasaratha, 
mounted  his  chariot  resplendent  as  name,  spread  with  tiger  skins 
and  which,  on  its  course,  made  a  noise  like  thunder.  Inlaid 
with  gold  and  gems,  it  dazzled  the  beholders  as  does  the 
brightness  of  the  sun.  The  horses  yoked  to  the  chariot,  equalling 
young  elephants,  galloped  as  swiftly  as  the  steeds  of  Indra. 

Shri  Rama,  seated  in  his  resplendent  chariot  moving  rapidly 
with  a  sound  as  of  thunder  issuing  from  the  clouds,  appeared 
like  the  moon  coursing  in  the  heavens.  His  younger  brother, 
Prince  Lakshmana  attended  him  standing  behind  him  in  the 
chariot,  with  a  chamara  in  his  hand. 

On  every  side,  shouts  of  "  Jai !  Jai ! "  arose,  while  the 
multitude  followed  Shri  Rama's  chariot  with  its  cavalcade  of 
mounted  horsemen  and  mountain-like  elephants.  Warriors 
whose  brows  were  anointed  with  sandalwood  paste  and  amber- 
gris, preceded  the  royal  chariot  bearing  naked  swords  in  their 
hands.  Then  followed  the  musicians  and  bards  singing  their 
praises  and  the  shouts  of  warriors  resembling  the  roaring  of 
lions.  The  chariot  went  forward  amid  a  rain  of  flowers  showered 
down  from  the  balconies  and  windows  by  beautifully  adorned 
women,  of  faultless  limbs,  who  thus  offered  salutations  to  Rama 
and  desirous  of  his  welfare  chanted  hymns  of  adoration,  saying : 
"  O  Delight  of  Thy  Mother,  whose  heart  to-day  is  raised  in 
exultation  because  of  thee  ;  to-day  thy  royal  mother  will  see 
thee  in  possession  of  the  throne. 

*'  The  Princess  Sita,  exceedingly  dear  to  Rama  is  esteemed  the 
most  fortunate  woman  in  the  world  by  womankind  who,  believing 
her  to  have  practised  a  high  degree  of  virtue  and  ascetism  in 
a  previous  birth,  say,  "As  the  planet  Rohini1  found  union  with 
the  moon,  so  has  the  Princess  Sita  found  union  with 
Rama." 

Hearing  the  delightful  eulogies  of  the  women,  Raghava 
pressed  on,  listening  to  the  converse  of  the  citizens  and  those 
come  from  afar,  concerning  his  approaching  coronation.    Some 

1  Rohini — fourth  of  the  lunar  aiterum*. 

»94 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

said :  "  To-day,  Shri  Ramachandra,  our  lord,  will  acquire 
limitless  wealth  and  power  through  the  favour  of  his  royal  sire. 
Those  people  over  whom  he  holds  sway,  will  obtain  their  heart's 
desire  and  the  fulfilment  of  their  ambitions.  Should  he  enjoy 
the  kingdom  for  long,  it  will  be  our  gain,  since  no  distress  will 
visit  the  kingdom  while  he  is  king." 

Thus  preceded  by  neighing  horses  and  the  praises  of  his 
dynasty  sung  by  chroniclers  and  bards,  Rama  advanced  like  the 
god  Kuvera,  while  on  every  side  he  beheld  the  decorated  high- 
ways filled  with  male  and  female  elephants,  chariots,  horses  and 
people  and  stalls  overflowing  with  gems  and  merchandise. 


CHAPTER    17 
He  advances  to  the  palace  amidst  the  plaudits  of  Ms  friends 

Seated  in  his  chariot,  the  prince  beheld  his  delighted  friends 

and  the  city,  white  as  a  cloud,  adorned  with  flags  and  banners 
fluttering  here  and  there,  fragrant  with  the  perfume  of  incense, 
filled  with  a  multitude  of  men  and  enriched  by  stately  buildings. 
Passing  through  the  scented  highways  where  heaps  of  sandal- 
wood were  burning,  and  rare  perfumes,  wool  and  silken  cloths, 
unpierced  pearls,  and  innumerable  gems  being  exposed  to  view, 
with  stalls  replete  with  articles  of  food  and  drink  and  merchandise 
of  every  kind,  he  beheld  the  royal  highway  adorned  like  the 
pathway  of  the  gods  in  heaven,  with  every  auspicious  mark, 
such  as  curds,  rice,  sandalwood,  parched  grain  and  milk. 
Traversing  the  cross-roads  gay  with  flowers  and  fragrant  objects, 
amidst  the  blessings  and  salutations  of  his  friends,  he  acknow- 
ledged their  praise  with  humility.  Those  advanced  in  years, 
were  crying :  "  O  Prince,  thou  who  art  to  be  crowned  to-day, 
let  thy  rule  resemble  thy  grandfather's  and  thy  great  grand- 
father's, thus  shall  we  prosper  as  in  the  days  of  thine  ancestors, 
may  our  happiness  exceed  even  those  times.  Neither  do  we 
require  the  comforts  of  this  world,  nor  those  of  the  other  world. 
Beholding  Shri  Ramachandra  returning  after  his  coronation, 
195 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

our  delight  will  exceed  all  else.  Nothing  is  dearer  to  us  than 
the  installation  of  Shri  Ramachandra  of  limitless  glory." 

Thus  did  Raghava  advance,  amidst  the  eulogies  of  his  friends 
the  focus  of  every  eye  and  heart,  serene  and  imperturbable. 
Those  who  were  unable  to  behold  him  or  were  unnoticed  by 
him,  became  objects  of  contempt  to  others,  nay,  they  were  a 
reproach  to  themselves.  The  all-compassionate  Ramachandra 
looked  on  each  of  the  four  castes  with  equal  condescension. 
Each  loved  him  according  to  his  capacity. 

Passing  the  temples,  the  sacred  groves  and  pavilions,  Shri 
Ramachandra  circumambulated  them  in  reverence.  He  now 
beheld  the  royal  palace,  resembling  a  white  cloud,  its  towers 
like  the  snow-capped  peaks  of  Mount  Kailasa,  its  balconies 
seeming  almost  to  reach  the  skies  like  the  fire  chariots  of  the 
gods ;  the  pleasure  houses  set  with  precious  gems,  caused  the 
whole  palace  to  excel  all  those  on  earth  and  rival  even  the  abode 
of  Indra. 

Approaching  his  father's  palace,  Shri  Rama  passed  through 
the  three  gateways  guarded  by  archers,  and  proceeded  on  foot 
through  the  fourth  and  fifth  enclosures.  There,  leaving  his 
attendants,  he  entered  the  private  apartments  of  the  king. 

The  multitude  seeing  Rama  enter  the  palace  were  filled  with 
joy  and  awaited  his  coming  forth  as  the  sea  awaits  the  coming

He  sees  the  Mug  full  of  anguish  and  speechless ;  Kaikeyi  utters 
the  cruel  words 

Entering  the  private  apartment,  Shri  Ramachandra  beheld 
King  Dasaratha  full  of  distress,  his  countenance  pale,  seated 
with  Kaikeyi  on  the  royal  couch.  First  placing  his  head  at  the 
feet  of  his  royal  sire,  he  then  respectfully  offered  salutations 
to  Mother  Kaikeyi. 
The  king,  his  eyes  filled  with  tears,  his  throat  choked  with 
196 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

emotion,  could  only  utter  the  word  "  Rama  "  and  nothing  more. 
As  the  heart  of  a  man  who  accidentally  touches  a  serpent  is  filled 
with  fear,  so  was  the  heart  of  Rama  on  beholding  the  king's 
misery.  The  king  agitated  by  grief  and  remorse,  sighing  bitterly, 
filled  with  anguish,  resembled  the  ocean  which,  calm  by  nature, 
is  agitated  by  a  mighty  storm,  or  Rahu1  causing  the  sun's  eclipse, 
or  the  soul  of  a  sage  stirred  by  the  utterance  of  falsehoods. 
Without  knowing  the  cause  of  the  king's  distress,  Shri  Rama 
became  agitated  like  the  sea  on  the  day  of  the  full  moon.  Shri 
Ramachandra,  ever  engaged  in  seeking  his  father's  welfare, 
reflected :  "  Why  is  my  father  not  happy  to  see  me  to-day  ? 
Formerly,  when  displeased,  on  beholding  me  he  was  pacified, 
but  to-day,  beholding  me,  he  is  troubled.  Why  is  he  overcome 
with  grief  and  bereft  of  his  glory  ?  " 

Making  obeisance  to  Kaikeyi,  he  said :  "  If  by  an  involuntary 
offence,  I  have  caused  my  father  displeasure,  then  O  Mother, 
propitiate  him  for  me.  Erstwhile,  even  when  displeased,  my 
father  showed  favour  to  me,  but  to-day,  I  behold  him  pale 
of  countenance,  and  deeply  distressed,  nor  does  he  speak  to  me. 
Is  my  revered  father  suffering  any  physical  or  mental  distress  ? 
It  is  rare  indeed  for  a  man  to  be  consistently  happy.  Has  his 
majesty  seen  any  grievous  fault  in  the  amiable  Prince  Bharata 
or  the  valorous  Shatrughna,  or  in  my  mothers  or  in  me  ?  I  do 
not  desire  to  live  a  single  instant  if  his  majesty  is  not  satisfied 
with  me,  or  is  displeased  or  if  I  have  disobeyed  him.  Why 
should  not  man  obey  his  parents,  who  are  the  source  of  his 
birth  and  who  are  living  gods  ?  Hast  thou  spoken  harsh  words, 
in  vanity,  to  the  king,  on  hearing  which  his  heart  is  lacerated  ? 
O  Devi,  answer  my  question  truly.  Tell  me  the  cause  of  this 
unprecedented  grief  in  my  sire." 

Kaikeyi  thus  addressed  by  Shri  Rama,  dead  to  all  shame 
and  skilful  in  defence  of  her  selfish  purpose,  spoke  arrogantly : 
"  O  Rama,  the  king  is  not  angry  nor  is  he  suffering  physical 
pain,  he  has  something  on  his  mind  which  he  fears  to  disclose 
to  thee.  He  loves  thee  dearly  and  so  hesitates  to  tell  thee  this 
unpleasant  matter.  It  is  for  thee  to  fulfil  what  he  has  promised 
to  me  and  to  act  in  accordance  with  it.    Having  formerly  granted 

1  Rahu — a  mythical  demon,  said  to  cause  the  eclipse  of  the  sun  and  moon 
by  iwallowing  it. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

me  a  boon,  he  now  repents  it  like  a  common  man.  To  promise 
a  boon  and  then  seek  to  evade  it,  is  like  the  setting  up  of  a  dam 
when  the  water  has  gone.  O  Rama,  have  a  care  lest  the  king 
abandon  truth  for  thy  sake.  Among  holy  men,  truth  is  said 
to  be  the  root  of  dharma.  Should  the  king  command  thee 
and  thou  fulfil  his  command  without  further  deliberation,  then 
will  I  reveal  the  whole  truth  to  thee.  The  king  may  not 
communicate  with  thee  directly,  therefore,  be  ready  to  execute 
what  I  command  on  his  behalf." 

Shri  Rama,  highly  agitated,  replied  to  Kaikeyi  in  the  presence 
of  the  king :  "  For  shame,  O  Devi,  to  speak  thus  to  me.  At 
the  command  of  my  father  I  am  willing  to  do  anything,  even 
to  casting  myself  into  the  fire.  At  the  bidding  of  the  king 
my  parent  and  author  of  my  welfare,  I  will  gladly  drink  deadly 
poison  or  throw  myself  into  the  sea.  O  Devi,  disclose  to  me 
his  will,  I  vow  to  fulfil  his  command.  Be  assured,  O  Mother, 
Rama  does  not  utter  falsehood." 

To  the  ever  truthful  Rama,  Kaikeyi  answered  in  these  wound- 
ing words :  "  O  Ramachandra,  long  ago  the  Maharajah  fought 
against  the  asuras  and  fell  wounded  on  the  field.  I  then 
preserved  him  and  he  promised  me  two  boons.  For  these  I  ask 
the  installation  of  Prince  Bharata  and  thy  exile  to  the  Dandaka 
forest.  O  Great  One,  if  thou  desirest  that  thou  and  thy  father 
should  uphold  truth,  then  hear  roe.  In  obedience  to  thy  father, 
now  go  into  exile  for  fourteen  years.  Let  the  preparations  made 
for  thine  installation  be  used  for  the  enthronement  of  Bharata. 
Giving  up  thy  claims  to  the  kingdom,  do  thou  with  matted  hair, 
wearing  a  deer  skin,  live  in  the  Dandaka  forest  for  seven  and 
again  seven  years.  Let  the  earth  be  ruled  by  Prince  Bharata. 
This  kingdom  filled  with  an  abundance  of  gems,  horses  and 
elephants  must  be  his.  On  account  of  this  is  the  king  distressed, 
his  countenance  pale  and  he  is  unable  to  look  on  thee.  O  Rama, 
obey  the  king  and  preserve  him  by  fulfilling  his  command." 

At  these  cruel  words  of  Kaikeyi,  Shri  Ramachandra  betrayed 
no  sign  of  distress,  but  the  king  realising  the  future  suffering 
of  his  son  was  overwhelmed  with  grief.

CHAPTER     19 

Shi  Ramackandra  betrays  no  sign  of  distress  and  prepares 
for  exile 

The  slayer  of  his  foes,  Shri  Ramachandra,  hearing  the  words 
of  Kaikeyi,  keen  as  the  pangs  of  death,  was  in  no  way  moved 
by  them,  and  answered :  "  Be  it  so  !  To  honour  the  promise 
made  by  the  king,  I  will  leave  for  the  forest  immediately,  with 
matted  locks,  attired  in  raiment  made  of  bark,  but  I  desire 
to  know  why  the  illustrious  sovereign  does  not  address  me  ? 
O  Devi,  fear  not,  I  vow,  in  thy  presence  that  I  shall  dwell 
in  the  forest,  dressed  in  bark  with  matted  locks  j  rejoice,  there- 
fore !  Whatever  command  the  benevolent  monarch,  ever 
mindful  of  my  welfare,  shall  lay  upon  me,  I  will  gladly  execute 
to  please  him.  There  is  nothing  I  would  not  do  for  him  without 
hesitation,  but  one  painful  thought  still  lingers  in  my  mind. 
Why  does  the  king  not  speak  to  me  himself  of  Bharata's 
enthronement?  O  Mother,  by  thine  order,  I  am  willing  to 
surrender  to  my  brother  Bharata,  not  only  the  kingdom,  but 
also  Sita,  together  with  every  object  of  desire,  my  wealth  and 
my  life.  How  much  more  would  I  do  for  my  father,  that  he 
may  preserve  the  vow  of  truth  and  serve  thy  purpose.  Render 
this  matter  clear  to  the  king.  How  is  it  that  I  behold  my  father 
with  bowed  head,  shedding  tears  ?  Let  messengers  on  swift 
horses  summon  Prince  Bharata  immediately  from  his  uncle's 
house,  while  I,  without  considering  the  merit  or  demerit  of 
my  sire's  injunctions,  enter  the  Dandaka  forest  for  fourteen  years." 

Queen  Kaikeyi  highly  pleased  by  the  words  uttered  by  Shri 
Ramachandra  and  assured  of  his  exile,  urged  him  to  depart, 
saying :  "  So  be  it ;  messengers  on  swift  footed  horses  will 
summon  Bharata  immediately  from  his  uncle's  home.  O  Rama, 
being  ready  to  enter  the  forest,  do  not  delay :  depart,  therefore, 
with  all  speed.  Overcome  with  shame,  the  king  dare  not  ask 
thee  to  depart,  but  do  thou  disregard  this.  0  Ramachandra, 
the  king  will  neither  bathe  nor  partake  of  food  till  thou  hast 
entered  upon  thine  exile." 

The  king,  hearing  the  words  of  Kaikeyi,  cried  "  Woe ", 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Woe  ",  and,  stricken  with  grief,  fell  senseless  on  die  golden 
couch.  Raising  up  the  king,  Shri  Ramachandra,  urged  on  by 
the  words  of  Kaikeyi  as  a  horse  under  the  lash,  prepared  to  enter 
the  forest  in  all  haste.  His  heart  unmoved  by  the  queen's  cruel 
words,  he  replied :  "  O  Devi,  I  did  not  desire  the  kingdom 
to  acquire  wealth  and  power,  but  becoming  regent,  I  wished  to 
preserve  dharma.  Know  me,  like  the  sages,  to  be  a  protector 
of  dharma.  If  I  can  render  any  service  to  my  father  at  the  cost 
of  my  life,  it  is  as  if  already  accomplished.  There  is  no  greater 
good  in  this  world  than  service  to  one's  sire  by  thought,  word 
and  deed.  On  this  command,  not  issued  by  the  king  but  by 
thee,  I  will  dwell  for  fourteen  years  in  the  uninhabited  forest. 
O  Sati,  thou  hast  been  my  mother  and  yet  art  unacquainted 
with  my  nature.  If  thou  had'st  known  me,  no  need  would 
have  arisen  to  consult  my  father  on  so  insignificant  a  matter. 
Now  I  go  to  take  leave  of  my  mother,  Queen  Kaushalya,  and 
offer  consolation  to  my  Sita.  Let  Bharata  rule  the  kingdom 
according  to  dharma  and  serve  our  royal  father  faithfully.  This 
is  a  son's  abiding  duty." 

Hearing  the  words  of  Shri  Ramachandra,  the  king,  speechless 
and  overcome  with  grief,  wept  aloud,  shedding  bitter  tears. 
The  most  illustrious  Rama  made  obeisance  to  his  father  lying 
pitifully  there  and,  then  bowing  to  the  feet  of  Kaikeyi,  left 
the  apartment.  Having  circumambulated  the  King  and  Queen 
Kaikeyi  with  extreme  reverence,  Shri  Ramachandra  came  forth 
from  the  inner  chamber  and  beheld  his  friends  standing  at  the 
door.  Shri  Lakshmana  full  of  wrath,  his  eyes  suffused  with 
tears,  followed  Rama. 

Shri  Rama  circumambulated  the  sacred  articles  prepared  for 
the  installation  ceremony  in  great  reverence,  and  prayed  that 
they  should  be  dedicated  to  the  installation  of  Prince  Bharata. 
Then  turning  from  them,  without  a  backward  glance  he  slowly 
withdrew. 

The  abandoning  of  the  ceremony  failed  to  impair  the  serenity 
of  Shri  Ramachandra,  the  splendour  of  his  countenance  remained 
unchanged  as  the  moon  suffers  no  diminution  of  its  beauty  in 
the  waning  period.  On  renouncing  the  kingdom  and  departing 
for  exile,  Shri  Ramachandra  resembled  a  great  yogi  and  none 
observed  any  change  of  mood  in  him. 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

Relinquishing  the  royal  canopy,  the  beautiful  chamara  and 
bidding  a  respectful  and  affectionate  farewell  to  his  friends  and 
the  people's  delegates  and  guests,  remembering  the  sorrow 
occasioned  to  them,  and  restraining  his  senses,  the  prince  went 
to  the  apartments  of  his  mother,  to  break  the  distressing  tidings 
to  her.  Those  about  him  found  no  change  in  him,  neither  in 
the  adornments  of  his  body,  donned  in  preparation  for  the 
royal  ceremony,  nor  in  the  cheerfulness  of  his  countenance. 
Such  was  the  truthful  Ramachandra.  As  the  autumnal  moon 
does  not  lose  its  splendour,  so  the  cheerfulness  of  the  mighty- 
armed  Rama  did  not  diminish.  Addressing  those  standing  near 
with  sweetness  and  respect,  he  approached  his  mother  Kaushalya. 

The  most  valorous  Prince  Lakshmana,  the  sharer  of  his 
brother's  joys  and  griefs,  followed  him.  Aware  of  the  great 
distress  that  would  arise  in  the  hearts  of  his  friends,  Shri  Rama 
for  his  mother's  sake  entered  the  palace  in  a  serene  and  cheerful 
mood. 


CHAPTER    20 

Queen  Kaushalya  is  afflicted  and  helpless  with  sorrow 

Perceiving  that  Lion  among  men,  Shri  Ramachandra,  his  palms 
joined  in  a  gesture  of  farewell,  coming  forth  from  his  father's 
apartments,  the  ladies  of  the  inner  chamber  began  to  lament 
loudly,  saying :  "  Shall  Shri  Rama,  who  fulfilled  all  our  desires 
without  awaiting  the  injunction  of  his  royal  sire  and  who  is 
our  sole  refuge,  to-day  go  into  exile  ? 

"  From  his  birth  he  has  honoured  and  respected  us  as  his 
own  mother,  Queen  Kaushalya.  When  we  have  spoken  harsh 
words  to  him,  he  was  never  angry,  nor  did  he  ever  give  any 
cause  for  displeasure.  That  prince  who  ever  reconciled  those 
who  were  affronted,  is  to-day  going  into  exile.  Our  king, 
acting  like  an  ignorant  man,  is  determined  to  destroy  his  subjects 
and  is  sending  Rama,  who  is  the  sole  support  of  all  beings, 
into  exile." 

Thus,  weeping  bitterly,  all  the  maids  of  honour  and  maid- 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

servants  of  the  king  lamented  like  cows  bereft  of  their  calves. 
The  king  hearing  their  cries  of  distress,  deeply  afflicted  with 
grief  for  his  son,  overcome  with  shame,  fell  down  on  his  couch. 
Shri  Ramachandra,  grieving  for  the  woes  of  his  relatives, 
breathing  like  a  mighty  elephant  approached  his  mother's  apart- 
ments with  Lakshmana. 

Entering  there,  he  beheld  at  the  first  gate  the  venerable  and 
aged  guardian  of  the  door  and  his  attendants,  who  rose  on 
perceiving  the  prince,  crying  "  Jai "  "  Jai "  to  him.  Reaching 
the  second  gate,  he  met  with  the  aged  brahmins  honoured  by 
the  state  for  their  great  learning.  Saluting  them,  he  entered 
the  third  gate  where  women,  the  aged  and  children  were  keeping 
guard.  The  women  gave  their  blessings  to  the  prince  and  went 
to  inform  the  Queen  Kaushalya  of  Shri  Rama's  arrival. 

According  to  scriptural  injunctions,  the  queen  had  spent  the 
whole  night  worshipping  Shri  Vishnu,  desirous  of  her  son's 
good.  Gad  in  a  silken  sari,  she  was  pouring  oblations  into  the 
sacred  fire,  with  joy.  Shri  Rama,  entering  the  chamber  of  his 
mother,  beheld  her  offering  oblations  into  the  sacred  flame; 
he  beheld  there  the  sacrificial  articles  prepared  for  the  worship 
of  the  gods ;  curds,  rice,  butter,  sweetmeats,  rice  cooked  in  milk, 
garlands  of  white  flowers,  sesamura  seed,  fuel  and  jars  filled 
with  pure  water. 

Shri  Rama  saw  the  fair  complexioned  queen  in  a  white  robe, 
emaciated  through  long  fasts.  After  a  time,  perceiving  her  son, 
Shri  Ramachandra,  she  ran  towards  him  as  a  mare  runs  to  meet 
its  foal.  Embracing  him,  inspired  by  maternal  love,  she 
addressed  the  great  Rama  with  gende  and  affectionate  words  : 
"  O  my  Son,  mayest  thou  become  aged  and  righteous  like  the 
royal  sages.  Mayest  thou  attain  the  age  appropriate  to  thy 
dynasty.  Mayest  thou  acquire  renown  and  fulfil  thy  family 
duties.  O  Dear  Prince,  now  approach  thy  truth-loving  father, 
who  awaits  thee  to-day  to  appoint  thee  regent  of  the  kingdom." 

Offering  her  son  a  seat,  she  placed  before  him  sweetmeats  ; 
Shri  Rama,  touching  them  only,  with  joined  palms  humbly 
addressed  her;  he,  ever  affectionate  and  now  showing  even 
greater  tenderness  in  protecting  his  mother's  honour,  said: 
"  O  Goddess,  thou  art  not  yet  acquainted  with  the  great  calamity 
that  threatens  us.    I  must  go  to  the  Dandaka  forest  and  have 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

come  to  seek  thy  sanction.  It  is  the  season  of  sorrow  for  thee, 
Sita  and  Lakshmana.  Now,  entering  the  forest,  my  seat  will 
be  of  kusha  grass  and  there,  residing  for  fourteen  years,  I  shall 
live  on  honey,  roots  and  fruits.  The  king  has  conferred  the 
regency  on  Prince  Bharata  and  I,  giving  up  royal  fare,  must 
enter  die  forest  to  eat  the  food  of  ascetics  there.  By  the  king's 
command,  Bharata  will  be  installed  as  regent.  For  fourteen 
years,  it  is  ordained  that  I  shall  live  in  the  forest,  practising 
asceticism  far  from  the  haunts  of  men.  The  forest  from 
henceforth  will  be  my  home;  roots  and  berries  will  be  my 
food!" 

Hearing  these  words,  the  queen  fell  to  the  ground  like  the 
bough  of  a  fir  tree  severed  from  the  trunk,  by  an  axe ! 
Resembling  a  nymph  fallen  from  heaven  or  a  phantom  tree 
struck  down,  she  fell.  Shri  Ramachandra  raised  her  to  her 
couch,  her  body  soiled  with  dust,  like  a  steed  that  has  rolled 
on  the  earth  and  gently  brushed  away  the  dust  with  his  own 
hands.  The  queen,  worthy  of  every  happiness,  seated  by  her 
son,  filled  with  distress,  addressed  him  in  the  presence  of  Shri 
Lakshmana: — 

"  O  Child,  O  Rama,  hadst  thou  not  been  born  of  my  womb, 
I  should  have  suffered  the  distress  of  being  childless,  but  I 
should  have  been  spared  this  sorrow.  O  My  Son,  were  I  a 
barren  woman,  I  should  not  have  been  thus  afflicted,  for  a  barren 
woman  has  but  one  grief,  that  of  being  childless.  The  fortune 
that  befalls  a  wife,  alas !  was  not  to  be  enjoyed  by  me  for  long ! 
Having  a  son,  I  looked  for  happiness,  but  now,  though  chief 
queen,  I  must  bear  the  piercing  words  of  my  rival  consorts, 
no  longer  showing  me  deference.  What  greater  calamity  can 
befall  a  woman?  The  insults  that  will  be  heaped  upon  me, 
without  thee,  will  prove  unendurable.  Alas !  This  is  the 
season  of  unfathomable  grief  and  affliction !  O  My  Son,  when 
thou  art  gone,  I  shall  cease  to  live.  As  chief  queen,  I  have 
already  borne  great  provocation  ;  now,  serving  Kaikeyi,  I  shall 
be  deemed  lower  than  her  maidservant,  indeed  some  say  I 
am  already  her  slave.  Those  who  attend  me,  will  desert  me 
on  beholding  Bharata  made  regent." 

Then  Queen  Kaushalya  growing  angry,  began  to  utter  bitter 
203 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

words,  saying :  "  How  shall  I,  thus  afflicted,  look  on  the  face 
of  Kaikeyi  ?  O  Rama,  seventeen  years  have  passed  since  thou 
didst  receive  the  holy  thread.1  Since  then,  I  have  lived  in 
expectation  of  thine  installation  and  the  termination  of  my 
sorrows,  but  now  X  must  suffer  further.  I  shall  not  be  able 
to  endure  this.  O  Rama,  I  shall  not  be  able  to  suffer  the 
contumely  of  the  other  queens  in  my  old  age.  O  Child,  not 
beholding  thy  countenance  resembling  the  full  moon,  how  shall 
I  bear  this  miserable  life?  I  have  kept  innumerable  fasts, 
worshipped  the  gods  and  nourished  thee  till  now,  yet  un- 
fortunate as  I  am,  it  has  proved  to  be  in  vain.  Surely  my  heart 
is  made  of  stone  that  it  has  not  broken  to-day,  it  resembles 
a  river  in  the  rainy  season  that  does  not  overflow  under  continued 
rain.  Surely  death  has  forgotten  me  or  there  is  no  room  in 
his  abode.  Had  it  not  been  so,  he  would  have  carried  me  hence 
to-day  like  a  doe  carried  away  by  a  lion.  Assuredly  my  heart 
must  be  as  hard  as  iron  that  it  is  not  riven  under  this  affliction. 
O  why  does  not  the  earth  open  and  engulf  me ;  it  seems  one 
cannot  die  before  the  time  appointed.  Those  sacred  austerities, 
fasts,  meditation  and  penance  undertaken  for  the  prosperity  of 
my  child  have  proved  vain,  like  seeds  sown  in  a  barren  field. 
If  at  this  time  of  sorrow,  I  might  die,  threatened  with  thy 
separation,  I  should  embrace  death  as  willingly  as  a  cow  deprived 
of  its  calf.  O  My  Son,  of  what  use  is  life  now  to  me,  robbed 
of  the  sight  of  thy  face  resembling  the  full  moon  ?  Kay,  I  will 
follow  thee  to  the  forest  like  a  feeble  cow  following  its  calf." 

Queen  Kaushalya,  the  mother  of  Rama,  afflicted  and  helpless, 
realising  her  own  unfortunate  position,  and  her  son  to  be  bound 
in  the  service  of  truth,  lamented  like  a  kinnari  whose  offspring 
has  been  made  captive.

It  is  possible  that  Shri  Rama  received  it  earlier.

Shri  Rama,  in  spite  of  the  laments  of  the  queen  and  Shri 
Lakshmana,  prepares  for  departure 

Shri  Lakshmana,  overcome  with  grief,  addressed  Mother 
Kaushalya  in  words  suited  to  the  occasion.  He  said  :  "  O  Mother, 
it  cannot  be  pleasing  to  thee  that  Rama,  at  the  command  of  the 
king,  who  is  subject  to  a  woman,  and  oblivious  of  the  prosperity 
of  the  kingdom,  should  go  to  the  forest.  Old  age  has  impaired 
the  intellect  of  the  monarch  who,  impelled  by  desire,  is  no  longer 
master  of  his  senses ;  what  words  will  he  not  utter  ?  I  see 
no  fault  in  Ramachandra  for  which  he  should  be  exiled  and 
deprived  of  his  kingdom.  I  know  no  man  whether  friend  or  foe 
who  can  find  fault  with  Rama  even  in  absence.  Like  a  god, 
he  is  guileless,  self-controlled  and  forbearing  even  to  his  foes ; 
what  righteous  king  would  abandon  such  a  son  without  cause  ? 
What  son  versed  in  the  discharge  of  a  sovereign's  duties  would 
give  obedience  to  so  puerile  a  king  ?  " 

Addressing  Rama,  Lakshmana  continued :  "  O  Brother,  before 
the  multitude  become  acquainted  with  these  tidings,  assume 
the  reins  of  the  kingdom,  I  will  assist  thee  in  the  undertaking. 

0  Raghava,  who  will  dare  oppose  thee,  when  like  death  itself, 

1  stand  by  thy  side,  armed  with  my  bow  ?  If  two  or  three, 
nay  if  all  the  people  of  Ayodhya  resist  thee  in  thine  undertaking, 
I  will  destroy  them.  If  all  the  supporters  of  Bharata  oppose 
thee,  not  even  one  shall  escape.  The  meek  are  ever  oppressed. 
Should  our  father,  inspired  by  Kaikeyi,  become  our  enemy, 
then,  though  worthy  of  protection,  I  will  undoubtedly  slay  him ! 
Even  should  a  spiritual  preceptor,  prompted  by  egoity,  follow 
the  evil  path  and  do  what  ought  not  to  be  done,  he  must  be 
restrained. 

"  On  what  authority  does  the  king  confer  the  kingdom  on 
the  son  of  Kaikeyi,  when  the  son  of  the  chief  queen,  rightly  heir 
to  the  throne,  still  lives  ?  O  Slayer  of  thy  Foes,  who  will  dare 
to  incur  our  enmity  and  give  Bharata  the  kingdom  ? 

"  O  Mother,  I  swear  by  the  truth,  by  my  bow,  by  the  laws 
of  charity,  by  the  merit  acquired  in  worshipping  the  gods,  that 
205 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

I  am  Shri  Rama's  willing  servant.  0  Devi,  should  Rama  enter 
the  blazing  fire  or  the  dark  forest,  know  I  shall  have  preceded 
him.  O  Goddess,  do  thou  and  Shri  Ramachandra  behold  my 
prowess  by  which  I  shall  destroy  all  your  sufferings,  as  the  sun 
destroys  darkness.  I  will  also  slay  the  king  enslaved  by  Kaikeyi, 
who  is  aged,  contemptible,  of  unsubdued  mind  and  in  his 
second  childhood." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  noble  Lakshmana,  Queen  Kaushalya 
was  overcome  with  grief  and  said  to  Shri  Ramachandra :  "  O 
Child,  thou  knowest  the  content  of  thy  brother's  heart,  now  act 
as  thou  considerest  meet.  It  does  not  befit  thee  to  abandon 
thy  sorrow-stricken  mother  at  the  unjust  words  of  her  rival. 

0  Righteous  One,  if  thou  art  established  in  dharma,  then  remain 
here,  serve  me  and  acquire  virtue.  There  is  no  higher  duty 
than  service  of  the  mother.  I  am,  with  the  king,  equally  an 
object  of  thy  reverence,  and  I  command  thee  not  to  go  to  the 
forest.  In  thy  separation,  there  is  no  occasion  for  rejoicing, 
neither  do  I  desire  to  live,  but  with  thee  I  will  gladly  live, 
sustaining  myself  on  herbs  alone.  If  thou,  leaving  me  afflicted 
with  grief,  go  to  the  forest,  then  shall  I  refuse  food  and  yield  up 
my  life.  Then,  O  My  Son,  being  responsible  for  my  death  thou 
wilt,  like  Samudra,1  unmindful  of  thy  mother,  enter  hell." 

Seeing  his  mother,  the  Queen  Kaushalya,  thus  lamenting, 
the  righteous  Ramachandra  spoke  to  her  dutifully,  saying :  "  O 
Goddess,  I  cannot  disregard  my  father's  commands,  therefore 

1  bow  before  thee  and  entreat  thy  favour  and  sanction  to  enter 
the  forest.  Know  that  the  Sage  Kandu,  a  great  pundit, 
acquainted  with  his  yogic  duty,  slew  a  cow  in  obedience  to  his 
father's  commands,  knowing  it  to  be  a  sin,  which  was  thereafter 
not  charged  against  him. 

"  In  ancient  times,  likewise,  in  our  own  dynasty,  the  sons 
of  King  Sagara,  digging  the  earth,  sacrificed  their  lives  at  their 
father's  behest.  At  the  command  of  his  father,  the  son  of 
Jamadagnya,  Parasurama,  with  his  axe,  cut  off  the  head  of  his 
mother  Renuka.  O  Devi,  these  and  other  godlike  men  have 
obeyed  their  rather  resolutely.  I,  too,  without  hesitation,  shall 
perform  that  which  benefits  my  father.  O  Mother,  not  I  alone 
obey  my  father  but  all  those  virtuous  men,  mentioned  by  me, 

1  Samudra — the  Lord  of  riven  who  killed  a  brahmin. 
206 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

have  been  obedient  to  their  father's  will.  I  follow  no  new  law* 
nor  one  contrary  to  the  traditions  of  the  royal  dynasty,  but  tread 
the  path  of  my  illustrious  ancestors.  I  am  accomplishing  nought 
which  has  not  already  been  accomplished  in  this  world.  He 
who  acts  in  accordance  with  his  father's  commands  does  not 
fall  from  virtue." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  his  mother,  Shri  Rama  addressed 
Lakshmana,  saying :  "  O  Lakshmana,  I  am  acquainted  with 
thine  immeasurable  love  for  me,  thy  valour  and  thy  prowess ; 
none  can  withstand  thee.  O  Lakshmana,  my  mother  endowed 
with  every  good  quality  is  now  subject  to  misery  and  grief 
through  ignorance  of  dharma  and  lack  of  resignation.  O 
Brother,  dharma  is  the  highest  good  on  earth,  Truth  and 
dharma  are  one.  My  father's  command  is  founded  on  dharma, 
hence  it  is  superior  to  my  mother's  ruling.  O  Hero,  it  is 
unworthy  in  one  seeking  the  supreme  fruit  of  dharma,  not  to 
fulfil  the  promise  made  to  his  father,  mother  or  a  learned 
brahmin,  I  cannot,  therefore,  disregard  my  father's  command. 
O  Hero,  inspired  by  my  father,  Mother  Kaikeyi  has  urged  me 
to  this  course,  therefore,  0  Lakshmana,  relinquish  the  idea  of 
bloodshed  and  embracing  the  state  of  virtue,  follow  me." 

Thus  lovingly  addressing  Lakshmana,  with  bowed  head  and 
in  great  humility  Rama  turned  to  Queen  Kaushalya  and  said : 
"  O  Goddess,  now  grant  me  permission  to  go  into  exile.  In 
my  absence  pray  for  me.  Having  honoured  my  vow,  I  shall 
return,  like  King  Yayati  who  falling  to  earth  from  heaven,  again 
ascended  thither.  O  Mother,  comfort  my  unhappy  father. 
Have  no  anxiety,  O  Mother,  I  shall  return  after  fourteen  years 
as  desired  by  my  father.  Do  thou,  Sita,  Lakshmana  and 
Sumitra  obey  my  royal  sire.  This  is  the  ancient  tradition.  O 
Mother,  disregarding  the  preparations  made  for  mine  installation, 
let  thy  mind  be  freed  from  grief  and  allow  me  to  go  into  exile 
as  ordained  by  dharma." 

Hearing  the  words  of  Rama,  inspired  by  righteous  motives, 
spoken  with  courage  and  equanimity,  Queen  Kaushalya  as  one 
restored  to  life,  gazed  steadfastly  at  Rama  and  said :  "  O  My 
Son,  if  thou  art  versed  in  dharma  and  art  mindful  of  the  good 
done  to  thee  by  thy  parents,  then  am  I  as  woithy  of  thy  respect 
as  thy  father.  O  My  Son,  do  not  abandon  thine  unfortunate 
207  p 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

mother  and  enter  the  forest.  O  My  Child,  of  what  use  is  my 
life  without  thee  ?  The  earth,  the  region  of  the  pittris,  heaven 
and  the  region  of  Mahaloka,  which  are  the  abodes  of  highest 
bliss,  for  me  are  all  void  without  thee.  An  hour  with  thee  is 
my  greatest  delight  O  My  Son." 

Shri  Rama,  hearing  his  mother's  lament,  was  agitated,  like 
a  king  who  is  perturbed,  when  on  a  dark  night  his  torch-bearers 
are  assailed  on  the  way. 

Then  the  dutiful  Rama  again  addressed  his  mother  rendered 
almost  senseless  with  grief  and  Lakshmana  distressed  and 
disquieted,  and  spoke  to  them  for  their  good,  in  words  that  were 
full  of  integrity : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  I  know  of  thy  prowess  and  the  intensity  of 
thy  devotion  to  me,  but  now  in  opposition  to  my  purpose,  thou 
dost  increase  my  mother's  misery.  O  Brother,  there  are  three 
means  to  happiness  in  this  world,  they  are  righteousness, 
prosperity  and  pleasure.  Those  who  love  righteousness  should 
pursue  it  as  a  wife  acquires  merit  by  being  obedient  to  her 
husband,  and  pleasure  by  endearing  herself  to  him  and  prosperity 
by  becoming  a  mother.  That  undertaking  which  does  not 
ensure  these  three,  should  be  given  up  and  that  by  which  they 
are  secured  should  be  carried  out.  He  who  pursues  prosperity 
alone,  is  without  friends  and  has  many  enemies,  and  he  who  is 
devoted  to  pleasure,  which  is  not  based  on  righteousness,  is  an 
object  of  contempt.  O  Brother,  the  king  is  firstly  our  preceptor, 
secondly  our  father  and  thirdly  he  is  an  aged  man.  From  the 
point  of  view  of  dharma,  I  must  obey  his  commands,  whether 
they  are  inspired  by  anger  or  desire.  As  a  righteous  man,  I 
must  fulfil  his  behests.  Rare  is  the  son  so  ruthless  as  to  disobey 
his  father.  How  can  I  evade  the  behests  of  my  sire,  who  is 
my  parent  and  has  full  authority  over  me  as  a  king,  and  further 
is  the  consort  of  my  dear  mother  Kaushalya  ?  How,  therefore, 
should  the  queen,  abandoning  the  virtuous  king,  her  lord,  follow 
me  like  a  widowed  woman  ?  O  Goddess,  grant  me  permission 
to  leave  for  the  forest  whilst  thou  dost  recite  the  Peace  Chant, 
that  my  vow  may  be  accomplished. 

"  Like  King  Yayati  of  old  who  returned  to  heaven,  inspired 
by  his  love  of  truth,  I,  too,  shall  return.  O  Mother,  I  dare  not 
208 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

disobey  my  father  for  the  sake  of  a  mere  kingdom  !  Life  is  brief 
and  I  have  no  desire  for  the  rulership  of  the  world  through 
the  sacrifice  of  virtue.*' 

The  mighty  Rama  thus  acquainting  his  mother  with  his 
intention  of  entering  the  forest  as  demanded  by  Kaikeyi,  circum- 
ambulated the  Queen  Kaushalya,  fixing  his  heart  on  his 
departure. 


CHAPTER    22 

He  appeals  to  Shri  Lakshmana  not  to  grieve 

Shki  RAMACHAMDRA  then  turned  to  Shri  Lakshmana,  who  unable 
to  endure  his  distress,  full  of  wrath  against  Kaikeyi,  his  eyes 
distorted,  was  breathing  heavily  like  a  mighty  elephant.  Address- 
ing him  in  terms  of  affection  as  a  beloved  brother  and  friend, 
patiently  calming  his  fears,  Rama  said  :  "  O  Brother,  give  up 
grief  and  anger  and  arm  thyself  with  patience,  forgetting  the 
preparations  made  for  mine  installation,  make  thyself  ready  for 
my  departure  to  the  forest.  O  Lakshmana,  prepare  with  the 
same  zeal  as  thou  didst  prepare  for  my  coronation.  The  mind 
of  my  mother,  Kaikeyi,  is  clouded  with  suspicion  on  account 
of  my  proposed  enthronement,  therefore,  O  Lakshmana,  act  so 
that  her  suspicions  may  be  allayed.  O  Brother,  Mother  Kaikeyi 
believes  thou  wilt  use  force  to  place  me  on  the  throne.  This 
I  cannot  endure,  nor  can  I  suffer  her  to  experience  anxiety. 
At  no  time,  do  I  recollect  that  I  have  voluntarily  given  cause 
for  offence  to  my  parents.  O  Lakshmana,  let  us  relieve  the 
apprehensions  of  our  royal  father,  ever  truthful  and  valiant  but 
now  fearful  lest  his  future  life  be  jeopardized.  If  I  do  not 
abandon  the  desire  for  the  crown,  the  distress  caused  to  the 
heart  of  the  king,  at  the  violation  of  bis  vow,  will  be  mine  also. 
O  Lakshmana,  because  of  this,  I  desire  to  enter  the  forest 
without  delay,  abandoning  the  project  of  mine  installation. 
Thinking  her  purpose  accomplished,  Queen  Kaikeyi  will  to-day, 
if  I  depart  for  the  forest,  cause  her  son  Bharata  to  be  summoned 
209 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  will  make  over  the  kingdom  to  him  with  joy.  The  heart 
of  Kaikeyi  will  find  no  rest  till  I,  dressed  in  a  deer  skin,  with 
matted  locks,  enter  the  forest.  I  cannot  grieve  her,  who  has 
urged  me  to  go  to  the  forest  and  contributed  to  my  resolution, 
therefore>  I  will  depart  without  delay.  O  Lakshmana,  the 
acquisition  of  the  kingdom  is  not  part  of  my  destiny.  If 
providence  had  favoured  me,  Kaikeyi  would  not  have  desired 
to  send  me  to  the  forest.  O  Dear  One,  thou  knowest  no 
distinction  was  made  by  me  between  my  three  mothers,  nor 
has  Kaikeyi  looked  on  me  as  different  from  Prince  Bharata, 
but  to-day  to  frustrate  my  coronation  and  send  me  into  exile, 
she  has  uttered  cruel  and  pitiless  words.  This  is  the  will  of 
God  and  nought  else.  Had  it  not  been  so,  how  should  Kaikeyi 
the  daughter  of  a  king,  of  gentle  disposition  and  noble  nature, 
speak  thus  like  a  vulgar  woman  in  the  presence  of  her  husband  ? 
Whatever  is  inscrutable  to  man  should  be  known  to  be  the 
decree  of  providence ;  even  Brahma  cannot  evade  the  conse- 
quences of  karma.1  It  is  this  unalterable  and  fixed  decree  that 
has  created  the  dissension  between  Kaikeyi  and  me,  not  to  be 
understood  by  man. 

"  Pleasure,  pain,  fear,  anger,  profit  and  loss,  life  and  death, 
and  similar  matters  come  into  being  as  a  result  of  our  karma. 
Even  the  sages  practising  great  austerities,  prompted  by  their 
karma,  abandoning  asceticism  have  been  swept  away  by 
concupiscence  and  avarice.  This  sudden  happening,  never 
apprehended,  this  frustration  of  a  well-devised  plan  is  the  work 
of  karma.  Therefore,  I  in  no  wise  regret  my  resolve  nor  the 
cancellation  of  my  coronation.  Do  thou  also  abandon  grief 
and  following  me  forget  the  preparations  for  the  coronation. 
O  Lakshmana,  with  these  vessels  of  water  brought  hither  for 
mine  installation,  let  my  dedication  to  the  ascetic  life,  be  made. 
Yet  what  use  have  I  now  for  these  sacred  waters  ?  From  now 
on,  I  shall  draw  water  with  mine  own  hands  for  every  ritual. 

"  O  Lakshmana,  do  not  grieve  that  the  installation  ceremony 
remains  unperformed.  We  know  by  reason  and  discernment 
that  there  is  little  difference  between  ruling  a  kingdom  and  living 
in  a  forest.    O  Lakshmana,  do  not  for  an  instant  blame  Queen

chapter   23 

Shri  Lakskmana  offers  to  defeat  all  those  who  obstruct  Shri 
Rama's  installation 

Instructed  by  his  brother,  Lakshmana,  his  head  bowed,  was 
filled  with  distress  on  account  of  Shri  Rama's  impending 
departure,  yet  glad  to  learn  the  secret  of  dharma.  Remaining 
in  the  cave  of  anger  awhile,  breathing  like  a  snake  provoked  in 
its  hole,  his  frowning  mien  resembling  an  enraged  lion,  swaying 
like  the  trunk  of  an  elephant,  with  quivering  limbs,  averting 
his  gaze,  he  addressed  his  elder  brother,  saying  :  "  O  Brother, 
in  this  evil  hour,  thou  art  subject  to  a  great  delusion.  Ill-timed 
is  this  assertion  that  disobedience  to  a  parent  is  contrary  to 
dharma.  It  does  not  become  one  virtuous  as  thou  art  to  speak 
thus.  Thou,  a  leader  among  warriors,  canst  control  thy  fate, 
yet  like  a  weak  man  thou  speakest  of  it  as  irrevocable.  Dost 
thou  respect  these  wicked  beings,1  O  Virtuous  One  ?  Dost  thou 
not  know  how  many  deceivers  appear  as  righteous  men  ?  Take 
note  how  the  king  and  Kaikeyi  for  selfish  ends  deceive  thee 
and  send  thee  into  exile.  If  this  matter  of  the  boons  granted 
to  Kaikeyi  were  true,  then  why  was  it  not  revealed  'ere  the 
preparations  for  thy  installation  were  made  ?  If  it  can  be  said 
it  was  done  in  error,  then  that  error  is  a  calamity.  It  will  cause 
dissension  among  the  people.  How  can  the  younger  take 
precedence  over  the  elder  in  matters  of  state  ?  I  cannot  suffer 
this,  O  Great  Hero,  pardon  me.  This  law  thou  praiseth,  by 
which  thy  mind  is  governed,  is  incomprehensible  to  me.  Thou 
who  art  powerful,  why  must  thou  submit  to  Kaikeyi  ?  Wilt 
thou  obey  the  unjust  command  of  thy  father,  contrary  to  the  law 
of  dharma  ?  Dost  thou  not  perceive  their  duplicity,  in  frus- 
trating thine  installation  under  the  pretext  of  granting  a  boon  ? 

1  The  King  and  Kaikeyi. 

211 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

I  consider  the  pursuit  of  such  a  course  to  be  worthy  of 
condemnation.  This  is  die  reason  for  my  distress.  Though 
our  parents,  the  King  and  Kaikeyi,  desire  to  harm  thee  and  are 
swayed  by  passion,  who,  except  thee,  would  countenance  then- 
design  ?  Yet  thou  attributest  this  matter  to  the  decree  of  fate. 
This  action  is  unpleasing  to  me.  Let  the  weak  and  the  cowardly 
trust  in  so  uncertain  a  fate,  heroes  and  men  of  patient  resolve, 
do  not  accept  the  dictates  of  karma.  He,  who  by  his  own 
endeavours,  conquers  fate,  never  suffers.  Let  it  be  seen  to-day 
whether  fate  or  exertion  prevail. 

"That  destiny1  which  prevents  thine  installation,  which 
resembles  an  elephant  refusing  to  respond  to  the  goad,  and 
having  broken  its  fetters,  is  wandering  about  unchecked,  that 
decree  will  I  conquer  by  my  prowess. 

'*  Neither  the  guardians  of  the  four  quarters,  nor  all  the 
dwellers  in  the  Three  Worlds,  united  as  one,  can  prevent  thine 
installation,  how  much  less  then,  my  father  ?  Those  who  have 
planned  thine  exile,  shall  themselves  pass  fourteen  years  in  exile. 
I  will  frustrate  the  hopes  of  my  father  and  Kaikeyi,  who, 
depriving  thee  of  the  kingdom,  seek  to  enthrone  Bharata.  The 
power  of  karma  will  not  bring  such  adversity  to  those  opposed 
to  us  as  my  valour  shall  inflict  on  them !  After  ruling  a 
thousand  years,  do  thou  retire  to  the  forest,  leaving  thy  sons 
to  govern  the  kingdom,  then,  like  our  ancestors,  who,  becoming 
aged,  withdrew  to  a  hermitage,  do  thou  continue  to  live  in  the 
forest.  Formerly,  kings  in  their  declining  years,  giving  over 
their  subjects  to  the  governance  of  their  sons  and  grandsons, 
used  to  retire  to  the  forest  as  ascetics.  If,  O  Rama,  thou  fearest 
to  rule  against  the  behests  of  the  king,  thinking  the  administration 
would  be  insecure,  I  will  protect  thy  kingdom  as  the  shore 
protects  the  earth  from  the  inroads  of  the  sea.  If  I  fail,  may  I 
never  be  called  a  hero  !  Now  fix  thy  mind  on  thine  enthronement 
with  these  auspicious  preparations ;  singlehanded  I  can  effect 
the  defeat  of  the  kings  who  obstruct  thine  installation.  These 
two  arms  of  mine  are  not  for  show,  nor  is  my  bow  a  mere 
decoration.  My  sword  was  never  meant  to  dangle  at  my  side, 
nor  are  my  arrows  designed  to  be  kept  in  the  quiver !  All  these 
axe  dedicated  to  the  task  of  destroying  the  enemy.    I  will  not 

*  The  remit  of  one's  karma. 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

brook  the  existence  of  my  foes.  With  my  keen  bright  sword,  I 
will  hew  their  bodies  to  pieces,  even  if  it  be  Indra  himself.  I  will 
cut  to  pieces  elephants,  horses  and  men  with  my  sword,  creating 
large  heaps  and  rendering  advance  impossible.  To-day,  my 
enemies  shall  fall  like  clouds  rent  by  lightning.  Donning  the 
godha,1  lifting  up  my  bow,  I  shall  strike  the  enemy  with  many 
shafts  and  large  numbers  of  them  with  a  single  arrow.  I  shall 
destroy  innumerable  soldiers,  horses  and  elephants  by  piercing 
their  most  vulnerable  parts  with  my  shafts.  To-day  I  shall 
demonstrate  the  power  of  my  weapons  and  establish  thy 
sovereignty.  To-day  these  two  arms  accustomed  to  be  adorned 
with  ornaments  and  sandalpaste  and  used  to  distributing  charity 
and  to  protecting  friends,  shall  prove  their  prowess  by  opposing 
those  who  obstruct  thine  installation.  O  Ramachandra,  I  am 
thy  servant,  tell  me  who  is  thy  foe  and  command  me  to  oppose 
him  so  that  severing  them  from  their  fame  and  friends,  the 
kingdom  be  placed  in  thy  hands." 

Shri  Ramachandra,  hearing  the  words  of  Lakshmana,  wiping 
away  his  tears,  consoled  him,  saying :  "  O  Dear  One,  know 
my  chief  valour  to  be  obedience  to  the  will  of  my  father ;  it 
behoves  the  virtuous  to  fulfil  their  father's  command." 


CHAPTER    24 

The  queen  realises  she  has  no  power  to  restrain  Shri  Rama's 
resolution 

Seeing  the  righteous  Ramachandra  determined  to  obey  his  sire, 
Queen  Kaushalya,  her  eyes  filled  with  tears  and  her  throat 
choked  with  emotion,  said : — 

"  O  Rama,  thou  hast  never  experienced  hardship.  Fruit  of

dharma,  hast  ever  spoken  sweetly  to  all,  how  wilt  thou  be  able

to  endure  living  in  the  forest?  He  whose  servants  live  on 
sweetmeats  and  butter,  how  will  that  Rama  of  mine  be  able 
to  live  on  roots  and  fruit?  Who  will  not  feel  insecurity, 
knowing  King  Dasaratha  to  have  banished  his  illustrious  and 
virtuous  son  ?  If  he  acts  thus  to  such  a  son,  what  of  myself  ? 
If  Ramachandra,  beloved  of  all,  is  compelled  to  enter  the  forest, 
then  undoubtedly  destiny  (past  karma)  rules  our  joys  and 
sorrows.  O  Child,  the  fire  of  grief  in  my  heart,  fanned  by  the 
wind  of  thine  absence,  fed  on  lamentation  and  affliction ; 
stimulated  by  tears,  emitting  the  smoke  of  anxiety,  will  utterly 
consume  and  destroy  me,  like  a  forest  fire  at  the  end  of  winter 
reduces  the  bushes,  creepers  and  grass  to  ashes.  O  Child,  as 
a  cow  runs  after  its  calf,  so  shall  I  follow  thee  wheresoever 
thou  goest." 

Rama,  listening  to  the  sorrowful  speech  of  Queen  Kaushalya, 
replied :  "  O  Mother,  the  king  is  sorely  distressed  by  the  deceit 
of  Kaikeyi,  and  I  also  must  leave  him  when  I  go  to  the  forest. 
The  Maharajah  will  not  survive  if  thou  also  come  with  me. 
No  more  cruel  act  can  a  woman  perform  than  to  leave  her 
husband ;  it  is  not  to  be  countenanced.  As  long  as  my  father 
lives,  it  is  for  thee  to  serve  him.  This  eternal  dharma  must 
be  followed  by  thee." 

The  virtuous  maharani  listening  to  the  advice  of  Shri 
Ramachandra,  he  who  overcame  difficulties  with  ease,  replied 
submissively  to  him :  **  O  My  Son,  thy  words  are  true.*' 

Shri  Rama  then  addressed  her  who  was  suffering  deep  distress, 
saying :  "  O  Goddess,  both  thou  and  I  must  obey  my  father. 
He  is  first  my  preceptor,  secondly  my  father,  thirdly  thy  husband 
and  finally  the  protector,  master  and  lord  of  us  all.  Having 
cheerfully  passed  fourteen  years  in  the  forest,  I  will  return  and 
do  thy  bidding." 

Queen  Kaushalya,  her  eyes  brimming  with  tears,  she  who 
did  not  merit  suffering,  answered  Shri  Ramachandra,  saying : 
"  O  My  Son,  how  shall  I  endure  dwelling  with  my  rivals  ? 
If  thou  art  resolved  to  enter  the  forest  at  the  command  of  thy 
father,  then  like  a  wild  doe  take  me  with  thee." 

To  his  weeping  mother,  Shri  Rama  replied :  "As  long  as 
a  woman  lives,  she  should  consider  her  husband  as  her  master 
and  her  lord.  The  king  is  our  master,  how  should  we  be 
ai4 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

masterless  while  the  king  lives  ?  Bharata  also  is  virtuous, 
humble  and  devoted  to  the  good  of  all.  He  will  undoubtedly 
treat  thee  with  respect  and  not  oppose  thee.  When  I  am  gone, 
let  not  the  king  surfer  on  account  of  my  separation,  and  let  him 
not  be  overcome  by  this  great  grief.  The  king  is  now  aged, 
it  becomes  thee  to  serve  him  with  every  care.  Even  a  virtuous 
woman,  devoted  to  piety  and  fasting,  if  negligent  towards  her 
consort,  comes  to  a  sinner's  state,  but  she  who  is  devoted  to 
her  lord  attains  heaven.  The  woman  who  is  ever  devoted  to 
her  husband  and  ever  ready  to  seek  his  welfare,  attains  heaven, 
even  if  she  has  not  worshipped  any  god.  Service  of  the  husband 
is  a  duty  sanctioned  by  ancient  tradition,  by  the  Veda  and  by 
the  scriptural  law.  O  Mother,  undertake  those  rituals  promoting 
universal  peace  and  serve  the  gods  with  floral  offerings.  For 
my  sake,  give  hospitality  to  pious  and  learned  brahmins  and 
await  my  return.  Performing  the  discipline  of  daily  purification, 
give  up  savoury  foods,  and  existing  on  simple  fare,  serve  the 
king.  Should  the  king  still  be  living  when  I  return,  truly  it 
shall  be  well." 

The  queen,  her  eyes  suffused  with  tears,  distressed  on  account 
of  the  impending  separation  from  her  son,  replied  to  Shri 
Ramachandra :  "  O  Child,  thy  resolution  to  enter  the  forest 
being  fixed,  I  have  no  power  to  restrain  thee.  O  Hero,  fate 
is  irrevocable,  therefore,  enter  the  forest  without  anxiety, 
mayest  thou  be  happy.  On  thy  return,  my  sufferings  will  cease. 
O  Auspicious  One,  when  thou  returnest  on  the  fulfilment  of 
thy  vow,  rendering  back  the  debt  thou  owest  to  thy  father, 
my  joy  will  be  complete.  None  can  comprehend  the  warp  of 
fate.1  It  is  fate  that  urges  thee  to  oppose  me.  O  Prince,  now 
depart  and  return  safely,  promoting  my  delight  with  a  pure 
heart.  O  Child;  I  pray  that  thou  wilt  return  soon,  and  that  I 
shall  behold  thee  in  robes  of  bark  with  matted  locks." 

Queen  Kaushalya,  knowing  that  Ramachandra  was  eager  to 
enter  the  forest,  reverently  gave  him  her  blessings,  uttering 
auspicious  words.

The  queen  gives  her  blessing  and  the  brahmins  pronounce 
the  benediction 

Restraining  her  grief,  sipping  a  few  drops  of  pure  water  from 
her  hand,  Queen  Kaushalya,  purifying  herself,  performed  the 
benedictory  rites  for  the  well-being  of  Rama.  She  said :  "  O 
Prince  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  I  may  not  restrain  thee,  therefore 
now  depart,  and  on  thy  return,  tread  the  path  of  the  virtuous. 
O  Great  Raghu,  may  that  dharma  which  thou  hast  practised 
with  courage,  preserve  thee.  May  the  gods  thou  hast  worshipped 
in  the  temples  and  on  the  highways  and  the  great  sages  protect 
thee.  May  the  weapons  given  thee  by  the  wise  Vishwamitra 
protect  thee.  O  Mighty  One,  preserved  by  this  service  rendered 
by  thee  to  thy  father,  mother  and  the  truth,  mayest  thou  live 
long.  May  the  sacrificial  kusha  grass,  sacred  grass  rings,  altars,

months,  the  whole  year  and  the  divisions  of  the  hour  promote 
thy  happiness !  May  the  devas,  the  adhityas8  and  the  asuras,

"  May  no  rakshasas,1  pisachas.,2  those  who  practise  cruelty, 
that  which  is  ill-omened  and  the  eaters  of  flesh,  ever  cause  thee 
injury !  May  no  monkeys,  scorpions,  gadflies,  serpents  or

dangerous  horns,  be  hostile  to  thee  ;  propitiated  by  me,  may 
they  not  cause  thee  injury  in  the  forest !  May  thy  way  be 
blessed,  may  thine  undertaking  be  crowned  with  success !  O 
My  Son,  mayest  thou  ever  find  fruits,  roots  and  the  means  of

May  all  things  between  heaven  and  earth  protect  thee  at  all

May  the  Lord  of  the  world,  Brahma,  Vishnu  and  the  gods  not 
mentioned  by  me,  protect  thee  in  the  forest !  " 

Then  the  illustrious  Kaushalya  worshipped  the  gods  with 
flowers  and  sandalwood,  offering  oblations  and  kindling  the 
sacred  fire  for  the  health  and  peace  of  Shri  Ramachandra  with 
the  aid  of  the  pious  brahmins,  learned  in  rituals.  With  butter, 
white  flowers,  sacrificial  fuel  and  mustard  seed  prepared  for 
the  oblation  by  Queen  Kaushalya,  the  learned  and  pious 
brahmins  performed  the  Hawan*  ceremony  for  the  welfare  of 
Rama. 

Then  the  mother  of  Rama  asked  the  brahmins  to  pronounce 
the  benediction  and  present  the  oblations  to  the  Lokopalas,  the 
priests  receiving  the  remainder.  With  honey,  curds,  rice  and 
clarified  butter,  the  brahmins  pronounced  their  blessings  and 
the  queen  having  offered  them  abundant  alms  and  whatsoever 
they  desired,  addressed  Rama,  saying :  "  O  Rama,  may  the 
same  blessing  bestowed  on  Indra  on  the  destruction  of  Bratra-

bearer  of  the  mace,  at  the  time  of  the  raising  of  the  amrita  from

My  Son,  may  the  good  fortune  attendant  on  the  blessed 
Trivikrama3  when  measuring  the  world  in  three  strides,  be 
thine  also.  O  Rama,  may  the  seasons,  the  ocean,  the  islands, 
the  Vedas  and  the  cardinal  points  contribute  to  thy  happiness." 

Thus,  scattering  rice  over  the  head  of  her  son,  die  large-eyed 
Queen  Kaushalya,  applying  sandal  paste  to  his  forehead, 
bestowed  on  Rama  the  healing  wood  '  Vishalya  Karina '.  For 
his  protection,  the  queen  silently  repeated  the  mantrams,  and 
though  her  heart  was  filled  with  distress,  appeared  as  one 
content.  Embracing  her  son,  and  kissing  his  head,  she  said : 
"  O  My  Son,  now  go  in  peace.  Mayest  thou,  having  fulfilled 
the  commands  of  the  king,  return  in  health  to  Ayodhya.  O 
Child,  my  joy  will  be  complete,  when  I  behold  thee  at  thy 
coronation.  My  troubles  ended  and  my  ambitions  fulfilled, 
on  thy  return  from  exile,  beholding  thee  occupying  the  throne, 
I  shall  know  supreme  happiness.  Having  fulfilled  the  injunc- 
tions of  thy  father,  thou  wilt  return,  and  I,  beholding  thee  clad 
in  royal  apparel  with  innumerable  gems,  shall  then  find  peace. 
O  Prince,  now  depart  and  accomplish  the  desire  of  Princess  Sita 
and  me." 

The  queen  reciting  the  Peace  Chant,  her  eyes  suffused  with 
tears,  embracing  her  son  again  and  again,  circumambulated  him, 
gazing  on  his  face. 

Touching  her  feet  repeatedly,  the  illustrious  Ramachandra,

CHAPTER    26 

Skri  Rama  acquaints  Princess  Sita  of  his  resolution 

SHRI  Ramachandra,  ever  devoted  to  virtue,  taking  leave  of  his 
mother,  ready  to  enter  the  forest,  passed  through  the  crowded 
streets,  by  his  excellent  qualities  inspiring  peace  in  the  hearts 
of  the  multitude. 

The  ascetic  Princess  Sita,  not  being  acquainted  with  what 
had  happened,  her  mind  full  of  joy  in  the  thought  of  the  coming 
coronation  of  her  consort,  worshipping  the  gods  and  proficient 
in  every  duty,  awaited  the  approach  of  her  lord  with  a  happy  heart. 

Meantime,  Rama  dressed  in  his  customary  apparel,  his  head 
bowed  in  humility,  entered  the  palace  filled  with  joyful  and 
richly  attired  persons. 

Seeing  Ramachandra  unadorned,  the  princess  was  filled  with 
consternation  and  fear,  and  rose  trembling  from  her  seat. 
Rama  beholding  the  princess,  dearer  than  life  to  him,  could  not 
restrain  his  distress.  Sita,  seeing  the  countenance  of  Rama, 
sad,  pale  and  moist  with  anguish,  addressed  him :  "  O  My 
Lord,  what  is  this  ?  To-day,  the  Pushya  planet  and  the  moon 
are  in  conjunction,  and  Brihaspati  in  the  ascendant,  this  is  the 
time  fixed  for  thy  coronation  by  the  holy  brahmins,  why  art 
thou  thus  distressed  ?  Why  do  I  not  behold  the  canopy,  pure 
as  foam,  set  with  a  hundred  stars  over  thy  head  ?  Why  are 
the  chamaras,  white  as  the  moon  or  the  swan,  not  waving  to 
and  fro  over  thee  ?  O  Great  One,  why  do  I  not  hear  the  bards 
to-day  eloquently  voicing  thy  praise,  or  the  pundits  reciting 
the  Chant  of  Peace  ? 

"  Why  have  the  learned  brahmins  not  anointed  thee  with 
honey,  and  curds  as  a  mark  of  thine  enthronement  ?  Why  art 
thou  not  attended  by  ministers,  citizens  and  courtiers  sumptu- 
ously attired  ?  Why  do  four  swift  steeds  with  golden  trappings, 
fleet  of  foot,  not  precede  thee  ?  I  do  not  behold  the  great 
elephant  resembling  a  cloud,  possessed  of  every  auspicious  mark,' 
in  thy  tram?  Why  dost  thou  appear  downcast  when  the 
preparations  for  thy  coronation  are  completed  ?  O  My  Lord, 
why  does  thy  countenance  manifest  no  signs  of  joy  ?  " 

Hearing  the  sorrowful  words  of  the  Princess  Sita,  Rama 
219 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

replied :  "  O  Sita,  my  honoured  father  has  commanded  me 
to  go  into  exile.  O  Princess,  born  of  an  illustrious  family, 
acquainted  with  the  law  of  dharma  and  eminent  in  virtue,  hear, 
while  I  tell  thee  what  has  befallen  me.  Long  ago  my  father, 
a  lover  of  truth,  granted  two  boons  to  my  mother  Kaikeyi. 
Beholding  the  preparations  for  my  coronation,  Kaikeyi  demanded 
the  fulfilment  of  her  boons  and  has  now  gained  ascendency  over 
his  mind.  In  accordance  with  the  two  boons  granted  to  her, 
it  is  mine  to  pass  fourteen  years  in  the  Dandaka  forest  and 
Prince  Bharata  to  be  installed  as  regent.  I  am  now  going  into 
exile  and  have  come  to  bid  thee  farewell.  Let  no  words  in 
praise  of  me  be  repeated  to  Prince  Bharata,  lest  he  withhold 
his  protection  from  thee.  It  is  for  thee  to  submit  to  his  will 
for  the  sake  of  thy  support  The  king  has  conferred  the  regency 
on  Prince  Bharata  forever.  It  behoves  thee  to  act  in  such 
a  way  that  he  be  not  displeased  with  thee.  O  Wise  One,  now 
I  go  to  the  forest  in  obedience  to  my  father's  behest,  remain 
here  with  a  quiet  heart.  O  Sinless  One,  when  dressed  as  a 
hermit  I  leave  for  the  forest,  then  do  thou  also  cease  to  adorn 
thyself.  Rising  early,  do  thou  worship  the  gods  according  to 
the  prescribed  rituals,  then,  approaching  my  father  and  mother, 
offer  obeisance  to  them.  My  mother,  Queen  Kaushalya,  having 
grown  old,  is  afflicted  on  account  of  my  departure,  it  becomes 
thee  to  serve  her  with  respect.  My  other  mothers  should  be 
honoured  and  served  by  thee  like  Queen  Kaushalya,  their  hearts 
are  also  full  of  love  towards  me.  like  my  own  mother 
Kaushalya,  they  have  also  cherished  me,  therefore  I  deem  them 
worthy  of  the  same  honour.  My  brothers  Bharata  and  Shat- 
rughna  should  be  regarded  by  thee  as  thy  brothers  or  thy 
sons.  It  behoves  thee  never  to  provoke  Prince  Bharata,  from 
now  ruler  of  the  kingdom  and  chief  of  the  family.  Served 
with  sincerity,  a  king  is  pleased,  but  if  provoked,  he  becomes 
full  of  wrath.  A  monarch  renounces  his  own  offspring  if 
they  oppose  him  and  receives  even  strangers,  as  friends,  who 
have  promoted  his  welfare.  O  Kalyani,  obeying  King 
Bharata,  remain  here,  seeking  his  good.  O  Dear  One,  I  shall 
enter  the  great  forest,  it  behoves  thee  to  remain  here;  I 
charge  thee  to  act  in  such  a  manner  that  no  one  will  be 
displeased."

CHAPTER    27 

She  entreats  Rama  to  allow  her  to  accompany  him 

The  sweet-speaking  Sita,  worthy  of  Rama's  love,  thus  being 
instructed  to  remain  in  Ayodhya,  though  filled  with  affection, 
indignantly  replied :  "  O  Offspring  of  a  great  king,  O  Rama, 
how  canst  thou  speak  in  such  wise?  O  Prince,  thy  words 
evoke  laughter.  O  Chief  of  Men,  father,  mother,  son  and 
daughter-in-law  live  according  to  their  merit  and  dependent 
on  it,  but  a  wife  enjoys  the  fortune  of  her  husband  since  she 
is  a  part  of  himself.  I  am  therefore  entitled  to  share  thy 
father's  command  and  also  go  into  exile. 

"  The  happiness  of  a  woman  depends  on  her  husband,  neither 
father,  mother,  son,  relative  or  companion  avail  her  at  death ; 
in  this  world  and  in  the  other  world,  the  husband  alone  is  her 
all-in-all.  If  thou  to-day  depart  for  the  forest,  I  will  precede 
thee  on  foot,  clearing  the  thorns  and  kusha  grass  from  thy  path. 

0  Hero,  relinquishing  anger  and  pride,  take  me  with  thee 
without  hesitation.  There  is  no  fault  in  me  that  merits  my 
remaining  here,  without  thee.  The  joy  experienced  by  lords 
of  men  whether  dwelling  in  a  palace  or  transported  in  an  aerial 
chariot  through  the  heavens  or  possessing  the  eightfold  psychic 
powers,  is  far  inferior  to  the  joy  of  the  wife  in  the  service  of 
her  lord.  My  royal  father  has  instructed  me  fully  in  the  duties 
of  a  wife  and,  therefore,  I  have  no  need  of  further  instruction 
in  the  matter.  Assuredly  I  shall  accompany  thee  to  the  forest, 
uninhabited  by  men,  filled  with  savage  beasts,  such  as  bears 
and  bulls.  O  My  Hero,  I  will  dwell  in  the  forest  as  happily 
as  in  the  palace  of  my  father,  having  no  anxiety  in  the  three 
worlds  save  the  service  of  my  spouse.  O  Hero,  I  will  wander 
with  thee  in  the  forest  according  to  the  ancient  spiritual 
ordinance,  free  from  desire  for  pleasure,  traversing  the  honey- 
scented  woodland.  O  Lord  of  my  Life,  since  thou  canst 
protect  and  support  innumerable  people,  canst  thou  not  more 
easily  protect  me?  without  doubt  to-day  I  shall  enter  the 
forest  with  thee,  O  Fortunate  Prince,  none  can  break  my  resolve. 

1  shall  live  happily  on  fruits  and  roots  with  thee  in  the  forest, 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

causing  thee  no  anxiety.  Under  the  protection  of  one  as  wise 
as  thee,  O  Lord,  I  desire  to  enjoy  the  beauty  of  lakes,  mountains 
and  rivers  without  hindrance.  O  Rama,  I  long  with  thee  to  see 
the  beautiful  lakes  where  swans  and  kavandava  birds1  play  and 
charming  lotuses  bloom.  There  will  I  bathe  with  thee,  O  My 
Lotus-eyed  Lord,  sporting  there  with  thee.  Thus  would  I  pass 
a  thousand  years  with  thee,  the  happiness  enjoyed  in  thy 
company  renders  even  the  delights  of  heaven  distasteful  to  me. 
O  Prince,  without  thee,  heaven  itself  would  not  please  me.  I 
long  to  enter  the  forest  with  thee  where  deer,  monkeys  and 
elephants  roam.  O  Prince,  serving  thy  holy  feet,  I  will  pass 
the  time  there  as  happily  as  in  my  royal  father's  house. 
Recogni2ing  no  other,  in  thee  my  mind  finds  its  highest  delight ; 
separated  from  thee,  I  shall  surely  die.  O  Master,  be  gracious 
enough  to  take  me  with  thee,  assuredly  I  shall  not  burden  thee." 
Shri  Ramachandra  hearing  the  humble  and  piteous  words 
of  Shri  Sita,  unwilling  to  let  the  princess  accompany  him, 
sought  to  dissuade  her  by  describing  the  hardships  of  a  forest 
life. 


CHAPTER    28 

Shri  Rama  seeks  to  dissuade  Her 

The  virtuous  Ramachandra,  devoted  to  truth  reflecting  on  the 
hardships  to  be  borne  in  the  forest,  in  spite  of  Sita's  entreaty 
was  unwilling  to  grant  her  request. 

Once  more,  he  addressed  the  weeping  Ska,  insisting  she 
should  not  accompany  him,  saying :  "  O  Sita,  thou  art  nobly 
born  and  devoted  to  the  practice  of  virtue ;  remain  here 
continuing  to  act  righteously.  O  Frail  Princess,  act  according 
to  my  will.  Life  in  the  forest  is  fraught  with  misery,  O  Sita, 
relinquish  the  thought  of  sharing  my  exile,  many  are  the  dangers 
there.  The  forest  is  named  'Antara  ',  meaning  it  is  unfit  for 
human  habitation.  For  thine  own  well-being,  I  advise  thee 
to  remain  here ;  in  the  forest  there  is  no  comfort    The  rivers

222 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

issuing  from  the  mountains  are  difficult  to  cross,  the  lions 
roaring  in  the  mountain  caves  strike  terror  in  the  heart  and 
render  the  forest  perilous ;  therefore,  remain  here.  O  Sita, 
many  wild  beasts  wandering  at  will  in  the  forest  may  assail  thee, 
therefore  life  there  is  full  of  danger.  The  deep  marshes  and 
the  rivers  infested  with  crocodiles  are  difficult  to  cross,  even 
an  elephant  may  find  them  impassable.  Many  savage  elephants 
wander  here  and  there  j  assuredly  the  forest  is  replete  with  perils. 
Waterless  are  the  paths  covered  with  thorns  and  poisonous 
creepers,  there  the  hoarse  cry  of  wild  fowl  re-echoes ;  the  forest 
is  a  source  of  suffering.  Wearied  by  journeying  the  traveller 
finds  no  silken  pillows  nor  a  soft  couch,  but  at  night  must  sleep 
on  the  bare  earth,  his  bed  the  fallen  leaves ;  verily  the  forest 
is  a  source  of  suffering !  O  Sita,  in  the  forest,  there  is  nought 
to  eat  save  the  fruit  that  has  fallen  from  the  trees ;  with  this 
the  traveller  must  be  satisfied  day  and  night,  therefore  the  forest 
is  a  source  of  suffering !  O  Daughter  of  Mithila,  fasting  to 
the  utmost  extent,  with  matted  locks,  wearing  robes  of  bark, 
one  must  constantly  worship  the  devas  and  pittris  and  offer 
respectful  hospitality  to  the  unexpected  guest.  Thrice  daily 
must  ablutions  be  performed  by  those  who  live  according  to 
the  prescribed  ordinance,  therefore,  the  forest  is  a  source  of 
suffering.  O  Youthful  Princess,  it  is  necessary  to  make  offerings 
of  flowers  on  the  altars,  plucked  by  one's  own  hand,  as  ordained 
by  the  sages.  A  dweller  in  the  forest  must  be  satisfied  with 
whatever  food  he  can  obtain,  therefore  the  forest  is  a  source 
of  suffering.  Great  storms  visit  the  forest,  covering  it  with 
darkness  by  day;  constant  hunger  and  many  other  perils 
prevail  there,  therefore  is  it  a  source  of  suffering.  O  Beautiful 
One,  great  snakes  and  pythons  dwell  in  the  forest,  serpents 
as  tortuous  as  the  currents  of  the  river  live  in  the  waters 
and  obstruct  the  traveller's  path,  therefore  the  forest  is  a 
source  of  suffering.  O  Delicate  Princess,  scorpions,  poisonous 
reptiles,  hornets  and  mosquitoes  afflict  one  constantly  in  the 
forest;  therefore  the  forest  is  a  source  of  suffering.  O  Charming 
Princess,  the  forest  is  filled  with  briars,  harsh  grass  and  gnarled 
trees  obstructing  the  way,  it  is  therefore  a  source  of  suffering. 
Life  in  the  forest  is  full  of  conditions  adverse  to  the  body  and 
manifold  dangers,  it  is  therefore  a  source  of  suffering.  O  Sita, 
223  Q 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

a  dweller  in  the  forest  must  relinquish  anger  and  avarice  and 
practise  severe  penances,  nor  must  fear  visit  him  in  the  midst  of 
alarms. 

"  Do  not,  therefore,  consider  entering  the  forest  which  is 
not  meant  to  be  thy  lot.  Reflecting  carefully,  I  see  nought 
but  suffering  in  the  forest  for  thee." 

Thus  Rama  disclosed  his  mind  to  Sita  and  sought  to  dissuade 
her  from  entering  the  forest,  but  the  princess,  sorely  distressed, 
unable  to  consent  to  his  counsel,  then  made  answer. 


CHAPTER    29 

Sita  continues  her  entreaties  but  the  prince  is  unwilling 
to  consent  to  her  departure 

Shri  Sita  hearing  Rama's  words,  was  greatly  distressed  and 

with  tears  coursing  down  her  cheeks,  answered  in  a  low  voice : — 

"  O  Rama,  the  sufferings  of  a  life  in  the  forest  described 
by  thee,  will,  through  my  love  for  thee  be  transmuted  to  joys. 
Deer,  bear,  lions,  elephants,  sarabhas,1  birds,  bulls  and  other 
woodland  beasts,  on  beholding  thy  matchless  countenance, 
will  flee  away  stricken  with  terror.  All  fear  thee,  O  Lord ! 
Instructed  by  my  elders  to  remain  in  thy  company,  it  behoves 
me  to  go  with  thee ;  separated  from  thee,  I  cannot  live.  When 
near  to  thee,  O  Rama,  even  Indra  the  King  of  the  Devas 
dare  not  do  me  injury.  O  Rama,  thou  hast  taught  me 
that  a  woman  must  not  be  parted  from  her  lord.  O  Most 
Wise  Lord,  long  ago,  in  my  father's  house,  I  was  told  by  one 
conversant  with  the  movements  of  the  planets  that  I  should 
have  to  dwell  in  the  forest.  O  Mighty  One,  since  I  was  told 
by  that  brahmin  skilled  in  occult  sciences,  of  my  life  in  the  forest 
with  thee,  I  have  looked  forward  to  the  time  with  joy.  O,  what 
felicity  to  live  with  thee  in  the  forest !  O  Dear  One,  thou 
must  grant  me  permission  to  go  to  the  forest  with  thee.  I  must 
go  with  thee,  it  cannot  be  otherwise,  thus  shall  I  prove  my 

1  Sarabha — a  legendary  animal  with  right  legs. 
224 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

fidelity,  enjoined  by  my  elders.  The  time  for  the  fulfilment 
of  the  brahmin's  prophecy  is  at  hand.  O  Hero,  I  know  all  the 
miseries  of  life  in  the  forest,  but  it  is  those  of  unsubdued  mind 
who  suffer  them.  While  still  living  in  my  father's  house,  a  pious 
and  saintly  woman  predicted  in  the  presence  of  my  mother, 
that  I  should  live  in  the  forest.  O  My  Lord,  formerly  I  have 
begged  thee  to  let  me  sport  with  thee  in  the  woods.  The  time 
is  now  come,  grant  my  prayer  and  let  me  go  with  thee  1  O 
Prince,  may  the  undertaking  be  propitious.  Glad  am  I  to 
accompany  thee  to  the  forest,  to  serve  thee  there  will  be  my 
great  delight.  O  Lord,  relinquishing  envy,  accompanying  thee 
in  the  forest,  all  my  sins  will  be  washed  away  through  my 
devotion  to  thee.  I  have  no  other  god  but  thee,  if  death 
overtakes  me  I  shall  not  experience  happiness  in  the  other  world 
without  thee.  I  have  heard  from  the  brahmins  that  a  woman 
given  by  her  father  according  to  the  sacred  ordinance  to  a  man, 
becomes  his  wife  in  this  world  and  also  in  the  other  world. 
O  Prince  of  Beautiful  Locks,  in  perfect  devotion  to  thee,  filled 
with  humility,  regarding  pain  and  pleasure  as  equal,  sharing 
thy  austerities,  permit  me  to  accompany  thee.  If  thou  art  still 
unwilling  to  take  me,  a  woman  distressed,  to  the  forest,  then  I 
will  seek  death  by  poison  or  drowning." 

In  this  wise,  Sita  entreated  Rama  to  let  her  accompany  him, 
but  Still  the  great  prince  was  unwilling  to  consent.  Seeing 
Rama  disinclined  to  grant  her  request,  Sita  was  filled  with  grief, 
and  her  hot  tears  fell,  moistening  the  earth.  Shri  Rama,  seeing 
the  princess  flushed  with  anxiety  and  indignation  still  sought 
to  divert  her  from  her  purpose. 


CHAPTER    30 

Seeing  her  fixed  resolve  Shri  Rama  grants  her  request 

Shri  Rama  again  stressed  the  dangers  of  the  forest  and  sought 
to  persuade  Sita  not  to  accompany  him ;  but  Sita,  with  fixed 
resolve,  trembling  with  fear  yet  urged  by  love  and  pride,  spoke 
as  in  jest :  "O  Rama,  if  my  father  the  Lord  of  Mithila,  had 
225 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

known  thee  as  a  man  in  form  only,  but  a  woman  at  heart,  he 
would  never  have  united  me  to  thee.  Alas !  that  men  in 
ignorance  speak  of  Rama  as  resembling  the  sun  in  splendour, 
when  in  reality  he  is  not  so.  O  Rama,  what  makes  thee  sad  ? 
Whence  thy  fear  that  thou,  abandoning  me  who  am  devoted 
to  thee,  shouldst  go  to  the  forest  ?  O  Hero,  know  me  to  be 
to  thee  what  Savitri1  was  to  Satyavanta,  the  son  of  the  valiant 
King  Dyumatsena.*  O  Sinless  Prince,  I  have  never  looked  on 
any,  even  in  thought,  but  thee,  nor  do  I  resemble  those  women 
dishonouring  their  family's  name  who  look  on  other  men ; 
therefore,  let  me  go  with  thee. 

"  O  Rama,  why  dost  thou  desire  to  surrender  me  to  Bharata, 
I,  who,  long  resident  with  thee,  thy  youthful  spouse,  am  solely 
devoted  to  thee  ?  Whether  living  as  an  ascetic  or  hermit  or 
residing  in  heaven,  I  will  follow  thee.  Journeying  in  the  forest 
will  not  weary  me ;  by  following  thee,  I  shall  experience  the 
same  delight  as  walking  in  the  gardens  or  sporting  with  thee 
in  the  woods.  O  Rama,  in  thy  company  the  thorny  briars 
such  as  kusha,  sarpat  and  shara  will  seem  to  me  as  soft  as 
deer  skin.  The  dust  raised  by  the  storm,  covering  my  body, 
will  be  as  sandalpaste  to  me.  I  shall  share  with  thee  the  couch 
of  grass  with  the  same  delight  as  a  bed  of  silken  down.  What 
ever  leaves,  roots  or  fruits  thou  dost  bring  for  me  will  be  as  sweet 
and  satisfying  as  ambrosia.  Enjoying  with  thee,  the  fruits  and 
flowers  of  every  season,  I  shall  not  call  to  mind  my  mother, 
rather  and  home.  No  anxiety  will  be  caused  to  thee  by  my 
presence  in  the  forest,  neither  shall  my  sustenance  be  a  burden 
to  thee.  I  tell  thee  the  forest  will  be  heaven  in  thy  company, 
and  without  thee  even  the  palace  will  be  hell  to  me.  Be 
pleased,  therefore,  to  let  me  go  to  the  forest  with  thee.  I 
fear  nought  in  the  forest,  but  if  thou  still  refuseth  to  take  me 
with  thee,  then  will  I  end  my  life  by  poison ;  never  will  I 
dwell  among  strangers.  O  My  Lord,  without  thee  nothing  is 
left  to  me  but  death ;  abandoned  by  thee,  it  were  better  to  die. 
I  cannot  endure  the  grief  of  thy  separation  even  for  an  hour, 
how  then  shall  I  suffer  it  for  fourteen  years  ?  "

Thus  Sita,  lamenting  and  embracing  Shri  Rama,  wept  aloud. 
From  her  eyes,  like  a  she  elephant  wounded  by  poisoned  arrows, 
long-restrained  tears  issued,  as  fire  is  kindled  by  the  friction 
of  wood.  Crystal  drops  fell  from  her  eyes  as  water  slips  from 
the  petals  of  the  lotus  flowers.  The  face  of  the  princess 
resembling  the  full  moon,  withered  by  the  fire  of  intense  grief, 
looked  like  a  lotus  withdrawn  from  water. 

Shri  Ramachandra,  taking  Sita,  afflicted  and  fainting,  in  his 
arms,  spoke  to  her  in  the  following  wise :  "  O  Devi,  I  do  not 
desire  even  to  enter  heaven  if  it  causes  thee  pain !  Nought 
do  I  fear  !  Like  Brahma,  I  am  wholly  fearless !  Though  able 
to  protect  thee  in  every  way,  yet  not  fully  knowing  thy  mind, 
I  declined  to  let  thee  share  my  exile.  Seeing  thou  art  destined 
to  share  my  exile,  I  do  not  desire  to  abandon  thee,  as  a  man 
of  virtuous  conduct  determines  not  to  sacrifice  his  good  name. 

0  Beautiful  One,  following  the  example  of  the  good  of  yore, 

1  shall  act  in  the  same  manner ;  do  thou  follow  me  as  Suvarchala1 
follows  the  sun.  O  Daughter  of  King  Janaka,  I  am  not  entering 
the  forest  by  my  own  desire,  but  to  obey  the  injunctions  of  my 
father.  O  Devi,  it  is  the  duty  of  a  son  to  obey  his  parents, 
I  could  not  endure  life  if  I  failed  to  observe  my  father's 
command.  Fate  is  invisible,  who  can  control  it,  but  the  parents 
and  the  spiritual  preceptor  are  visible  deities  and  their  orders 
must  be  obeyed.  What  in  the  world  is  so  sacred  as  the  worship 
of  that  which  grants  dharma,  prosperity  and  pleasure  ?  By 
this  worship,  homage  is  paid  to  the  three  worlds.  O  Sita, 
observance  of  truth,  charity  and  sacrifice  accompanied  by 
suitable  offerings  (dakshina)  is  of  less  avail  in  obtaining  the 
spiritual  realm  than  the  service  of  parents  and  the  Guru.  Those 
who  serve  their  parents  and  the  spiritual  preceptor  obtain 
heaven,  wealth,  learning  and  progeny  and  nothing  is  impossible 
for  them.  Those  who  are  devoted  to  their  parents  and  their 
Guru  obtain  entrance  to  heaven  and  the  regions  of  the  devas, 
the  gandharvas  and  Brahma.  This  is  eternal  righteousness — to 
obey  the  command  of  thy  parents,  fixed  in  the  practice  of  truth. 
O  Sita,  not  knowing  thy  mind,  I  advised  thee  not  to  accompany 
me*  but  now  seeing  thy  fixed  resolve  I  desire  to  take  thee  with 
me.    O  Princess,  whose  eyes  sparkle  like  wine,  thou  art  destined 

1  Suvarchala — consort  of  the  Sun. 

227 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

to  be  my  companion,  do  thou  assist  me  in  the  performance  of 
my  duty.  It  is  well  that  thou  didst  desire  to  be  with  me  in 
accordance  with  the  custom  of  our  forbears.  O  Sita,  prepare 
to  go  into  exile  without  delay ;  without  thee,  even  heaven  does 
not  please  me.  Bestow  thy  jewels  on  the  brahmins  in  charity 
and  offer  food  to  the  poor  ;  hasten,  make  no  delay.  Give  to 
the  brahmins,  jewels,  ornaments,  rich  apparel,  whatever  thou 
possessest  or  is  employed  for  my  entertainment,  all  that  is  mine 
and  thine,  couches,  coverlets,  and  vehicles  give  in  charity  to 
the  brahmins  and  what  remains  distribute  among  the  servants." 
Shri  Sita,  happy  at  the  acquiescence  of  Prince  Rama  and 
knowing  her  departure  to  be  fixed,  began  to  distribute  all  her 
possessions.  Free  from  anxiety,  Sita  bestowed  on  the  pious 
brahmins  her  wealth  and  all  her  jewels. 


chapter   3  I 

Shri  Lakshmana  is  resolved  to  accompany  them 

Shri  Lakshmana  being  present,  hearing  the  converse  of  Rama 
and  Sita,  was  afflicted  and  unable  to  restrain  his  grief,  and 
weeping  bitterly,  spoke  as  follows  :  "  If  thou  art  resolved  to 
enter  the  forest  in  which  dwell  many  wild  beasts  and  elephants, 
I  will  accompany  thee  with  my  bow  and  arrows.  I  will  wander 
with  thee  in  the  beautiful  forest  to  the  delightful  sounds  of 
birds  and  deer  abounding  there.  O  Ramachandra,  without 
thee  I  do  not  care  to  dwell  even  in  the  region  of  the  gods  nor 
do  I  desire  immortality  or  dominion  over  other  abodes." 

Seeing  Prince  Lakshmana  determined  to  accompany  him  to 
the  forest,  Shri  Ramachandra  sought  to  dissuade  him,  but  Shri 
Lakshmana  answered  :  "  O  Brother,  having  already  granted  me 
permission  to  accompany  thee,  why  dost  thou  now  prohibit  me  ? 
O  Sinless  One,  I  would  fain  know  what  prevents  thee  from 
taking  me  with  thee ;  my  mind  is  clouded  with  fears." 

Shri  Ramachandra  perceiving  Lakshmana  humbly  standing 
before  him  ready  to  accompany  him,  said :  "  O  Lakshmana, 
thou  art  most  dear  to  me,  virtuous,  brave  and  constantly  engaged 
228 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

in  righteous  deeds,  thou  an  as  dear  to  me  as  my  life.  Thou  art 
my  younger  brother,  my  servant  and  my  friend.  If  I  grant 
thy  request,  who  will  protect  the  renowned  Kaushalya  and 
Sumitra  in  thine  absence  ?  O  Brother,  the  king  who  granted 
their  desires,  as  a  cloud  responds  to  the  need  of  the  earth, 
is  still  under  the  bondage  of  pleasure  desire.  When  Kaikeyi, 
the  daughter  of  King  Ashvapatti,  becomes  the  queen  mother, 
she  will  not  treat  her  rival  consorts  well.  She  will  not  heed 
the  needs  and  comforts  of  Queen  Kaushalya  and  Sumitra,  nor 
will  Bharata,  governed  by  his  mother,  respect  them.  Therefore, 
O  Lakshmana,  remaining  here,  winning  the  king's  favour, 
render  Queen  Kaushalya  happy.  O  Brother,  heed  my  instruc- 
tion. O  Knower  of  Dharma,  acting  thus,  thou  wilt  demonstrate 
thy  great  devotion  to  me  and  also  serve  thy  mother  and  thereby 
earn  great  merit.  O  Lakshmana,  reflecting  on  these  words, 
follow  my  injunction.  Bereft  of  us,  our  mothers  cannot  be 
happy." 

Rama  having  uttered  these  words,  the  eloquent  Lakshmana 
replied  in  gentle  accents:  "O  Hero,  Bharata  will  assuredly 
have  due  regard  for  the  Queens  Kaushalya  and  Sumitra.  If 
Bharata,  having  obtained  this  mighty  kingdom,  through  evil 
counsel  and  pride  should  not  protect  the  queens,  I  will  assuredly 
slay  that  wicked  wretch.  O  Noble  One,  Mother  Kaushalya 
can  well  command  thousands  like  me.  That  illustrious  queen 
can  easily  protect  my  mother  and  herself  and  countless  others. 
Make  me  thy  humble  attendant,  there  is  no  wrong  in  this. 
Thus  shall  my  highest  desire  be  accomplished  and  thou  shalt 
also  find  satisfaction.  Armed  with  my  bow  and  arrows,  a  spade 
and  basket,  gathering  wild  fruit  and  flowers,  I  shall  precede 
thee,  pointing  out  the  way.  Each  day,  I  shall  provide  thee  with 
ascetic's  food,  leaves  and  other  suitable  offerings.  Do  thou, 
with  the  daughter  of  the  King  of  Videha,  enjoy  thyself  on  the 
mountain  slopes.    Sleeping  or  waking,  I  shall  do  all  for  thee." 

Shri  Ramachandra  listened  to  the  loving  words  of  Shri 
Lakshmana  with  delight  and  answered :  "  O  Lakshmana,  seek 
the  permission  of  thy  mother  Sumitra,  and  other  relatives  to  go 
with  me.  O  Lakshmana,  fetch,  without  delay,  the  dread  bows 
given  by  Vanma  himself  to  Rajarishi  Janaka  at  the  time  of  the 
great  sacrifice,  also  the  impenetrable  armour  and  the  celestial

which  King  Janaka  presented  to  me  at  the  time  of  my  nuptials

Knowing  his  exile  to  be  certain,  Shri  Lakshmana  bade  farewell 
to  his  relatives  and,  bringing  the  weapons  decorated  with  fresh 
flowers  from  the  home  of  Shri  Vasishtha,  presented  them  to 
Ram  . 

Tl"  i  Shri  Ramachandra  spoke  joyfully  to  Lakshmana  and 
said :  "  O  Handsome  Prince,  thou  art  welcome  at  this  hour, 
O  Bi  ther,  I  desire  to  offer  all  my  substance  in  charity  to  the 
brahrrins  and  ascetics,  do  thou  assist  me.  To  those  brahmins 
dwellu  g  in  the  city  devoted  to  their  Guru,  to  them  and  to  my 
servants  distribute  all  my  wealth.  Summon  the  excellent 
Suyajna,  the  son  of  Shri  Vasishtha,  and  bid  him  come  here 
without  delay.  Having  duly  honoured  him  and  other  pious 
brahmins,  I  shall  set  out  for  the  forest." 


CHAPTER    32

Commanded  by  Shri  Rama,  Lakshmana  went  to  the  house  of 
the  Rishi  Suyajna.  Beholding  the  rishi  seated  in  his  sacrificial 
pavilion,  he  made  obeisance  to  him  and  said :  "  Renouncing 
the  kingdom,  Shri  Ramachandra  is  entering  the  forest,  come 
in  all  haste  to  see  him  embark  on  this  arduous  undertaking." 

Having  performed  his  evening  devotion,  the  Rishi  Suyajna, 
in  company  with  Prince  Lakshmana,  entered  the  beautiful  and

golden  thread,  amulets  and  other  jewels,  and  at  Sita's  instance,

necklace  and  gold  which  Shri  Sita  offers  to  thy  spouse,  also 
the  bracelets  and  rings  of  beaten  gold  and  jewelled  bangles ; 
about  to  enter  the  forest,  Shri  Sita  offers  them  to  thy  wife. 
Accept  also  this  soft  pure  couch  with  a  coverlet  embroidered 
with  precious  stones,  pearls  and  tassels.  This  elephant  also, 
named  Shatranjaya,  which  my  uncle  gave  me,  I  present  to  thee, 
O  Great  Rishi,  together  with  a  thousand  golden  coins." 

Suyajna,  requested  by  Shri  Rama,  accepted  all  the  gifts,  and 
gave  his  blessings  to  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sita.  Then  Rama, 
ever  of  sweet  speech,  addressed  Lakshmana  as  Brahma  addresses 
Indra,  saying :  "  O  Lakshmana,  call  hither  the  two  excellent 
sons  of  the  Rishi  Agastya  and  Shri  Vishwamitra,  and  honour 
them  with  gifts  of  gems.  Give  to  each  in  abundance  as  a  field 
of  corn  is  visited  by  rain,  a  thousand  cows,  gold,  silver,  jewels 
and  ornaments.  To  that  brahmin,  versed  in  the  Taittirya1 
who  daily,  with  devotion,  gives  his  blessing  to  Queen  Kaushalya 
and  Sumitra,  who  is  learned  in  the  Vedanta  and  experienced 
in  all  matters,  give  vehicles,  silken  robes  and  women  attendants, 
so  that  he  may  be  wholly  satisfied.  To  my  confidential  adviser, 
Chitaratha,  who  has  served  me  over  a  long  period,  give  precious 
jewels,  cloths  and  abundant  wealth,  and  to  the  brahmacharis, 
my  fellow  students  who  study  the  Veda  and  are  of  excellent 
conduct,  following  no  profession,  living  detached,  enjoying  good 
food,  yet  dependent  on  alms,  give  to  each  of  these  a  thousand 
cows.  O  Lakshmana,  bestow  on  them  eighty  camels  apiece 
loaded  with  jewels,  a  thousand  bullocks  loaded  with  rice  and 
two  hundred  bulls  for  tilling  the  ground.  O  Lakshmana,  give 
them  cows  so  that  they  may  enjoy  butter,  milk  and  curds,  and 
to  each  of  the  brahmacharis  attending  on  Queen  Kaushalya  give 
a  thousand  cows  and  a  thousand  golden  coins  and  give  them 
abundant  alms  so  that  my  mother  may  be  pleased  with  us.*' 

Obeying  the  commands  of  Prince  Rama,  Shri  Lakshmana 
offered  hospitality  to  the  brahmins.  Like  Kuvera,  he  gave  to 
every  brahmin  abundant  wealth  as  instructed  by  his  brother. 
Then  Shri  Rama,  seeing  his  servants  standing  near  him  weeping, 

1  Taittirya  Sanhita — A  collection  of  teachings  from  the  Black  Yajurveda, 
instructions  on  the  performance  of  sacrifice. 

231 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

bestowed  on  them  sufficient  wealth  for  their  entire  lives  and 
said :  "  Until  I  return  from  die  forest,  keep  watch  on  the  palace 
belonging  to  Shri  Lakshmana  and  myself." 

Then  all  wept  overcome  at  the  thought  of  his  departure,  and 
Rama  turning  to  his  treasurer  said :  "  Bring  hither  my  wealth," 
and  they  heaped  quantities  of  gold  and  silver  before  him, 
wonderful  to  behold.  Then  Rama  with  the  aid  of  Lakshmana 
distributed  it  among  the  aged,  the  sick  and  the  needy. 

Now,  there  was  a  certain  brahmin  of  the  family  of  Garga, 
whose  name  was  Trijata,  whose  complexion  was  pale  on  account 
of  much  privation.  He,  toiling  honestly,  went  to  the  forest 
daily  with  spade,  axe  and  plough,  maintaining  his  family  on  the 
fruits  and  flowers  of  the  forest.  His  wife,  worn  down  with 
much  poverty,  gathering  her  young  children  together,  addressed 
her  husband,  saying :  "Abandoning  thy  plough  and  spade, 
follow  my  instructions.  Go  with  all  speed  and  approach  the 
virtuous  Shri  Ramachandra,  undoubtedly  thou  shalt  obtain 
something  there.** 

The  brahmin,  covering  himself  with  a  few  wretched  rags, 
set  out  for  Shri  Rama's  palace,  his  countenance,  in  lustre,1 
resembling  that  of  the  Rishi  Bhrigu  or  Angiras. 

Entering  the  fifth  gate  unchallenged,  he  came  to  where  the 
multitude  were  assembled  and  approaching  Shri  Ramachandra, 
said :  "  O  Illustrious  Prince,  I  am  destitute  of  wealth  and  having 
many  children,  subsist  on  what  I  find  in  the  forest,  look  upon 
me  with  compassion/' 

Shri  Rama  answered  jestingly :  "  I  have  still  many  thousand 
cows  not  yet  bestowed  on  any.  Casting  thy  staff  from  this  spot, 
I  will  bestow  on  thee  as  many  cows  as  can  stand  in  the  space 
between  thee  and  where  the  staff  has  fallen." 

Trijata,  hearing  these  words,  binding  his  rags  firmly  about 
his  waist,  twirling  his  staff,  threw  it  away  with  all  his  might. 
The  staff  fell  on  the  further  bank  of  the  river  Sarayu  where 
thousands  of  royal  cows  and  bulls  were  grazing.  Shri  Rama 
ordered  all  these  to  be  driven  to  the  brahmin's  hermitage  and 
thus  addressed  him :  "  Be  not  displeased,  O  Brahmin,  that  I 
jested  with  thee ;  I  desired  to  test  thy  great  powers.    Now,  the 

1  It  is  here  implied  that  the  exalted  state  of  the  brahmin  expressed  itself  in 
the  form  of  spiritual  radiance. 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

cattle  will  be  driven  to  thine  abode,  ask  further  whatsoever  thou 
desirest.  O  Brahmin,  I  will  bestow  anything  thou  asketh  on 
thee ;  all  my  wealth  is  to  be  given  to  the  brahmins.  Nothing 
so  pleases  me  as  the  bestowal  of  my  wealth  on  brahmins  such 
as  thou,  bringing  me  renown." 

Then  the  brahmin  Trijata  highly  gratified,  taking  the  cows, 
departed  with  his  wife,  full  of  power,  renown  and  devotion, 
blessing  Shri  Ramachandra. 

Thereafter,  Rama  bestowed  the  remainder  of  his  wealth, 
acquired  through  virtue,  upon  his  friends,  honouring  them  with 
marks  of  respect.  There  was  not  a  brahmin,  servant,  pauper 
or  beggar  that  he  did  not  honour  with  charity  at  that  time. 


chapter   33 

He  goes,  with  Sita  and  Lakshmana,  to  King  Dasaratha's  palace 

Shri  Rama,  having  with  Sita,  distributed  riches  in  abundance 
to  the  brahmins  in  charity,  went  with  Lakshmana  and  Sita  to 
see  King  Dasaratha,  followed  by  their  servants  bearing  weapons 
adorned  with  flowers  and  sandalwood. 

The  people  of  the  capital  mounting  to  the  top  of  high  buildings 
and  the  roofs  of  seven-storied  houses  to  view  them,  were 
dispirited.  Some  said:  "Behold  now  Shri  Rama,  formerly 
attended  by  four  divisions  of  the  army,  is  to-day  only  followed  by 
Sita  and  Lakshmana."  Others  answered,  "  Shri  Rama,  having 
tasted  the  delights  of  sovereignty  and  experienced  in  all  the  joys 
of  life,  he  who  confers  wealth  on  the  needy,  prompted  by  duty, 
desires  to  render  fruitful  the  promise  of  his  sire.  To-day,  Sita 
never  beheld  before  even  by  the  birds,  is  exposed  to  the  view 
of  the  common  people  on  the  highway." 

One  said :  "  Surely,  the  king  is  possessed  of  an  evil  spirit 
or  he  would  never  send  so  dear  a  son  into  exile."  And  another, 
"  None  ever  banished  even  a  traitor,  how  much  less  Shri 
Rama  who  has  won  the  affection  of  the  whole  world  by  his 
excellent  conduct  ?  He  is  not  only  virtuous  but  is  innocent, 
233 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

compassionate,  learned,  truthful,  self-controlled  and  of  subdued 
mind.  His  subjects  are  as  distressed  at  the  thought  of  his  absence 
as  the  water-fowl  during  the  summer  drought.  The  sufferings 
of  Rama,  Lord  of  the  world,  afflict  all,  as  does  a  tree  uprooted 
from  the  earth.  The  glorious  Ramachandra,  knower  of  dharma, 
resembles  the  root  of  a  tree  of  which  the  flowers,  fruit, 
leaves  and  branches  are  the  people.  Let  us,  abandoning  our 
gardens,  fields  and  homes,  sharing  his  woes,  follow  Shri  Rama. 
Our  houses  deserted,  their  treasure  removed,  their  courtyards 
neglected,  without  grain  or  stores,  their  beauty  gone,  will  be 
buried  in  dust.  The  devas  will  no  longer  visit  them,  but 
mice  scurrying  hither  and  thither  will  fill  them  with  countless 
holes.  Without  water,  covered  with  soot,  uncleansed,  no  daily 
rites  will  be  performed  there.  Fallen  in  ruins,  strewn  with 
broken  vessels,  as  if  cursed  by  the  king  or  by  divine  decree, 
all  these,  utterly  forsaken  by  us,  let  Kaikeyi  enjoy. 

"  We  pray  that  this  city  abandoned  by  Shri  Rama  may  be 
converted  into  a  wilderness  and  the  forest  where  Rama  dwells 
become  a  flourishing  city.  May  the  snakes  forsake  their  holes, 
the  deer  and  birds  abandon  their  abode  in  the  mountains  and 
valleys,  and  the  lion  and  elephant  leave  the  forest,  in  fear  of  us 
and  come  and  dwell  in  the  capital  of  Ayodhya.  May  the  city 
abandoned  by  us,  bereft  of  hay  and  grain  having  become  the 
resort  of  serpents,  deer  and  birds,  be  ruled  by  Kaikeyi  and  her 
son  and  may  we,  dwelling  in  the  forest  with  Rama,  enjoy  fully 
every  happiness." 

Shri  Rama  passing  by,  hearing  their  converse,  was  not  in  any 
way  disturbed,  but  proceeding  slowly,  like  a  young  elephant, 
with  majestic  stride  approached  the  palace  of  his  father  which 
resembled  the  Meru  mountain.  Shri  Rama  entering  the  royal 
palace  guarded  by  seasoned  troops,  beheld  Sumantra  standing 
there  disconsolate.  Shri  Rama,  with  a  smiling  countenance, 
passing  the  people  who  were  afflicted  and  filled  with  grief, 
approached  his  father's  apartment,  desirous  of  serving  him. 

Before  entering  the  royal  chamber,  he  requested  Sumantra, 
dejected  on  account  of  Rama's  departure,  to  inform  the  king 
of  his  arrival.  Desirous  of  fulfilling  the  command  of  the 
virtuous  monarch,  Shri  Rama,  determined  to  enter  the  forest, 
requested  Sumantra  to  make  known  his  presence  to  the  king. 
234 


AYODHYA    KANDA 


CHAPTER     34 

The  king  gives  his  blessing  while  the  whole  palace  is  filled 
with  lamentation 

The  dark-complexioned,  lotus-eyed  Ramachandra,  that  peerless 
prince,  instructed  his  minister  to  announce  his  arrival  to  the 
king.  On  this,  Sumantra  entering  the  royal  apartment,  beheld 
the  king  sorely  distressed,  lamenting  bitterly,  like  the  sun  under 
eclipse  or  a  fire  buried  in  ashes  or  a  lake  without  water. 

The  learned  Sumantra  with  joined  palms,  addressed  the 
sorely  grieving  monarch  by  praising  him  in  a  fitting  manner 
and  offering  obeisance,  he  said :  "  Jai  to  thee,  O  King." 
Then,  falteringly,  in  low  and  gentle  accents  he  added :  "  O 
King,  thy  son  Rama,  that  Lion  among  men,  is  at  thy  door, 
having  distributed  his  whole  wealth  to  the  pious  brahmins  and 
servants ;  now  having  taken  leave  of  his  friends,  he  wishes  to 
approach  thee.  Clothed  with  every  excellent  quality  as  the  sun 
with  its  rays,  he  is  about  to  depart  for  the  forest,  be  pleased 
to  receive  him,  O  Sire.** 

The  virtuous  monarch,  the  knower  of  dharma,  profound  as 
the  sea,  pure  as  the  sky,  spoke  :  "  O  Sumantra,  summon  the 
ladies  of  the  court,  I  wish  to  see  Rama  in  their  presence.** 

Entering  the  private  apartments  of  the  queens,  Sumantra 
said :  "  His  majesty  demands  your  presence,  go  to  him  without 
delay.**  Thus  addressed  by  Sumantra,  in  obedience  to  the 
wishes  of  their  consort,  they  prepared  to  approach  the  king. 
Three  hundred  and  fifty  women,  their  eyes  reddened  with 
weeping  on  account  of  Rama's  departure,  surrounding  Queen 
Kaushalya,  slowly  advanced  towards  the  king.  They  being 
present,  the  king  commanded  Sumantra  to  bring  his  son  before 
him. 

Sumantra  bringing  Shri  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sita  with  him, 
speedily  entered  the  apartment  of  the  king.  The  monarch 
beholding  Shri  Rama  approaching,  rose  from  his  seat,  and  ran 
towards  him  in  haste,  with  his  consorts,  but  ere  he  reached 
him  fell  senseless  to  the  earth. 

235 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Then  Shri  Rama  and  Lakshmana  advancing,  lifted  up  the 
king  who  had  been  rendered  unconscious  by  grief  and  suffering. 
The  palace  resounded  with  the  lamentations  of  a  thousand 
women  crying,  "  Rama,  Rama  **,  "Alas  I  Alas  !  "  the  tinkling 
of  their  ornaments,  drowned  in  the  tumult  of  their  cries. 

Shri  Rama  and  Lakshmana  supporting  the  king  in  their  arms, 
conveyed  him  to  the  couch,  and  after  a  long  time,  he  revived. 
Then  Shri  Ramachandra  addressed  the  monarch  who  was 
sinking  in  the  ocean  of  grief,  and  said :  "  O  Great  King, 
Master  of  All,  I  am  about  to  enter  the  Dandaka  forest,  be 
gracious  enough  to  look  on  me  with  favour.  Grant  also  that 
Lakshmana  and  Sita  accompany  me,  since  they,  setting  aside 
my  counsel  that  they  should  remain  here,  have  with  fixed 
purpose,  resolved  to  follow  me.  O  Sire,  giving  up  grief, 
command  us,  as  Prajapati  commands  his  subjects." 

His  eyes  filled  with  compassion,  fixing  his  gaze  on  his  beloved 
son,  the  king,  knowing  him  to  be  about  to  enter  the  forest 
with  a  serene  heart,  said  :  "  O  Ramachandra,  I  have  been 
deceived  by  Queen  Kaikeyi  by  reason  of  a  promise,  do  thou, 
setting  me  aside,  seize  the  kingdom  of  Ayodhya  by  force." 

Hearing  the  king's  words,  Rama,  eminent  in  virtue,  spoke 
eloquently  and  humbly :  "  My  Lord,  may  God  grant  thee  yet 
a  thousand  years  to  live  and  rule  the  earth!  Desirous  of 
following  truth,  I  shall  assuredly  enter  the  forest,  dwelling  there 
fourteen  years.    I  shall  then  return  to  serve  thee  and  offer  thee 


Held  fast  in  the  toils  of  truth,  the  king,  urged  on  by  Kaikeyi, 
wept  and  full  of  distress,  answered :  "  O  Child,  to  attain  felicity 
in  the  other  world  and  renown  on  earth  and  for  the  sake  of 
thy  return,  enter  the  forest  with  a  peaceful  heart.  May  no  fear 
from  any  source  visit  thee  on  the  way.  O  Ramachandra,  firm 
in  truth  and  in  the  performance  of  duty,  none  can  divert  thee 
from  the  path  of  righteousness.  O  My  Son,  do  not  yet  depart, 
stay  one  more  night  with  thy  mother  and  me.  Satisfied  after 
the  night,  early  in  the  morning,  do  thou  set  out  for  the  forest. 
My  Child,  for  my  sake,  thou  hast  undertaken  that  which  none 
can  accomplish.  For  my  good  and  my  future  happiness,  thou 
hast  chosen  to  enter  the  forest.  O  Child,  in  truth,  I  cannot 
suffer  thy  departure  but  am  helpless.  Deceived  by  Kaikeyi, 
236 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

whose  designs  resemble  a  file  covered  with  ashes,  I  am  caught 
in  this  snare,  but  why  must  thou  also  suffer  ?  O  Child,  what 
wonder  that  thou,  my  eldest  son,  should  desire  thy  father  to 
uphold  the  truth." 

Hearing  the  words  of  his  afflicted  parent,  Shri  Rama,  deeply 
distressed,  answered :  "  O  Father,  if  to-day  I  should  remain 
happily  in  the  royal  palace,  what  of  to-morrow  ?  Therefore, 
with  thy  permission,  I  would  fain  leave  at  once.  Let  thy 
kingdom,  filled  with  wealth  and  grain,  inhabited  by  thy  subjects, 
surrounded  by  tributary  states,  be  given  to  Prince  Bharatal 
O  Giver  of  Boons,  my  resolution  to  enter  the  forest  is  fixed. 
Thus  hast  thou  ordained!  I  shall  reside  in  the  forest  for 
fourteen  years  with  the  ascetics.  Do  thou,  without  delay,  give 
the  kingdom  to  Bharata !  I  desire  nought,  nor  is  happiness 
as  dear  to  me  as  obedience  to  thy  commands.  O  My  Father, 
do  not  grieve,  nor  be  distressed ;  the  mighty  ocean,  Lord  of  the 
Rivers,  does  not  overstep  its  bounds.  O  Sire,  I  desire  neither 
kingdom  nor  pleasure,  nor  even  Janaki,1  nor  delight,  nor  heaven, 
nor  life  itself,  but  only  wish  to  see  thee  the  votary  of  truth. 

0  My  Father,  thou  art  as  a  god  to  me,  I  vow  by  the  truth 
and  the  merits  acquired  by  me  that  my  words  are  free  from 
the  taint  of  hypocrisy.  O  My  Father  and  Lord,  I  cannot  remain 
here  a  moment  longer ;  restrain  thy  grief,  nothing  can  move  me 
from  my  resolve.  When  Kaikeyi  commanded  me  to  enter  the 
forest,  I  answered  "  I  will  go  ",  therefore,  true  to  my  word, 

1  shall  depart.  Do  not  be  distressed,  O  My  Lord,  I  shall  live 
in  the  forest  where  peaceful  deer  abound  and  birds  sing  their 
beautiful  lays.  O  Father,  a  father  is  said  to  be  the  god  of  gods  ; 
knowing  thee  to  be  a  supreme  deity,  I  am  obedient  to  thy 
behests.  O  August  King,  I  shall  easily  pass  fourteen  years  in 
the  forest  and  then  return  to  thee.  Now  it  becomes  thee  to 
pacify  those  afflicted  and  sorrowful.  O  Lion  among  men,  fulfil 
thy  duty  and  do  not  fall  a  victim  to  grief.  I  renounce  the 
capital  the  kingdom  and  the  earth  ;  let  them  be  given  to 
Bharata.  Without  hesitation  I  shall  follow  thy  command  and 
enter  the  forest.  Let  this  kingdom  adorned  by  high  mountains 
and  deep  forests,  filled  with  cities  and  villages,  be  ruled  by 
Prince  Bharata  according  to  dharma.    Let  thy  word  be  fulfilled.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

0  King,  my  heart  is  not  given  to  delights  nor  to  any  object 
of  pleasure,  all  I  desire  is  to  carry  out  thy  commands,  approved 
by  virtuous  men.    O  King,  give  up  all  sorrow  for  my  sake ; 

1  neither  desire  happiness  nor  wealth,  nor  the  earth,  nor  Janaki, 
nay  not  even  life.  I  desire  the  world  to  know  thee  as  the  votary 
of  truth.  O  My  Lord,  be  happy.  I,  entering  the  forest  filled 
with  many  kinds  of  trees,  viewing  the  mountains  and  rivers, 
shall  dwell  joyfully,  living  on  fruits  and  roots." 

The  king  filled  with  anguish,  embraced  his  son  and  fell 
senseless  to  the  earth.  The  queens  all  began  to  lament,  save 
Kaikeyi  alone.  Then  the  aged  Sumantra  also  fell  unconscious 
and  the  whole  palace  was  filled  with  lamentation. 


CHAPTER     35 

Sumantra  arraigns  Queen  Kaikeyi 

Coming  to  his  senses,  the  minister  Sumantra,  overcome  with 
anger,  breathing  heavily,  grinding  his  teeth,  wringing  his  hands, 
beating  his  head,  his  eyes  growing  red,  his  colour  altered, 
showed  every  sign  of  distress.  Perceiving  the  Queen  Kaikeyi 
to  have  forfeited  the  king's  regard,  Sumantra  pierced  her  heart 
with  words  as  keen  as  arrows,  causing  her  to  tremble. 
Penetrating  to  the  most  vulnerable  parts  of  her  being,  Sumantra 
exposed  the  hidden  defects  of  the  queen  by  his  barbed  words. 
He  said :  "  O  lady,  thou  hast  abandoned  thy  husband  the 
nourisher  and  supporter  of  the  movable  and  immovable. 
There  is  nought  undesirable  in  the  world  that  thou  hast  not 
accomplished.  I  consider  thee  the  murderess  of  thy  husband 
and  the  destroyer  of  thy  family.  By  thy  vile  deeds,  thou  hast 
smitten  King  Dasaratha,  who  is  unconquerable,  who  resembles 
Indra  and  who  is  immovable  as  a  mountain.  O  Kaikeyi,  do  not 
insult  the  aged  king  who  has  conferred  these  boons  upon  thee. 
Obedience  to  her  husband  should,  in  a  woman,  far  exceed  the 
love  of  a  thousand  sons.  It  is  the  ancient  tradition  of  this 
dynasty,  that  the  eldest  son  succeed  his  father,  but  thou  seekest 
238 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

to  revoke  it  and  make  thy  son  ruler  while  the  aged  king  still 
lives.  Let  thy  son  Bharata  rule  the  kingdom,  we  will  follow 
Kama  wheresoever  he  goes.  No  one  of  good  report  will  remain 
to  help  thy  son  in  the  administration,  since  thou  seekest  to 
repudiate  the  immemorial  usage.  I  wonder  the  earth  does  not 
open  and  swallow  thee  for  thy  misdeeds.  Why  do  the  holy 
sages  not  condemn  thee  utterly  ?  What  fool  cuts  at  the  root 
of  a  sweet  mango  tree  with  his  axe  in  order  to  plant  a  nimba1 
tree  in  its  place,  which  does  not  bear  sweet  fruit  even  if  watered 
with  milk.  It  is  a  common  saying  that  honey  does  not  flow 
from  the  nimba  tree.  I  perceive  thee  to  be  as  wicked  as  thy 
mother.  The  sins  committed  by  thy  mother  are  known  to  me, 
I  have  heard  of  them  on  trustworthy  report.  Thy  father,  by 
virtue  of  a  boon  granted  to  him  by  a  Yogi,  understood  the 
language  of  all  creatures ;  of  every  bird,  he  understood  the 
voice.  Once,  returning  to  the  capital,  he  heard  the  converse 
between  two  ants  and  laughed,  whereupon  thy  mother  grew 
wrath  and  threatened  to  take  her  life,  saying :  '  I  must  know 
the  cause  of  thy  laughter.'  The  king  replied,  saying :  'OLady, 
if  I  tell  thee  the  cause  of  my  laughter,  it  will  undoubtedly  lead 
to  my  death.'  Then  thy  mother  spoke  to  her  husband,  Kaikeya 
saying :  '  I  care  not  if  thou  livest  or  diest,  tell  me  the  cause 
of  thy  laughter.  If  thou  wen  dead,  thou  couldst  not  insult 
me  with  thy  laughter '." 

The  king  approaching  the  Yogi,  told  him  the  whole  story, 
and  the  Yogi  said :  "  O  King,  let  thy  wife  return  to  the  house 
of  her  father  or  die,  do  not  thou  reveal  the  secret  to  her."  Then 
King  Kaikeya  with  a  contented  mind  abandoned  thy  mother, 
and  lived  free  like  Kuvera.  O  Sinful  Queen,  thou  also  followeth 
the  evil  path,  deceiving  the  king  and  urging  him  to  evil  ways. 
It  is  a  true  saying  *  The  son  follows  the  father  and  the  daughter 
the  mother '.  Do  not  follow  thy  mother,  but  obey  thy  husband, 
the  king,  our  protector,  by  regarding  his  word.  Cease  to  be 
ruled  by  evil  and  do  not  lead  thy  husband  into  the  way  of 
unrighteousness.  The  king  will  not  rescind  the  promise  made 
to  thee.  O  Lady,  entreat  the  king  to  bestow  the  crown  on  Rama 
who  is  the  eldest  son,  who  is  generous,  virtuous,  a  fulfiller  of  his 
duty,  and  a  protector  of  all  living  beings.    If  Shri  Rama  goes

to  the  forest,  the  whole  world  will  speak  ill  of  thee.  Let  thy 
mind  be  at  peace  and  let  Rama  be  crowned.  If  any  other  than 
Rama  rule  the  kingdom,  it  will  not  profit  thee.  If  Rama 
becomes  regent,  then  the  king  following  the  ancient  tradition 
wjll  doubtless  retire  to  the  forest" 

Thus  did  Sumantra  with  harsh  words  arraign  the  queen  in 
the  assembly,  but  Kaikeyi  was  in  no  wise  moved,  neither  did 
she  show  any  sign  of  repentance,  nor  did  her  countenance  change. 


chapter  36 

She  disregards  the  words  of  the  chief  minister  and  the  king 

Then  King  Dasaratha,  deeply  distressed  on  account  of  his  vow, 
addressed  the  weeping  Sumantra,  saying :  "  O  Sumantra, 
prepare  four  divisions  of  the  army  laden  with  wealth  to 
accompany  Shri  Rama.  Let  beautiful  and  eloquent  women 
and  merchants  follow  in  his  train,  together  with  rich  traders 
who  can  set  up  stores  stocked  with  those  things  necessary  for 
the  army  of  Shri  Rama.  Let  those  personal  attendants  pleasing 
to  Rama,  having  received  abundant  wealth,  accompany  him.  Let 
chosen  citizens  accompany  Rama  with  instruments  of  war  and 
vehicles,  and  those  who  know  the  forest  paths,  go  also.  Shri 
Rama  hunting  the  deer  and  elephants,  drinking  fresh  honey 
and  enjoying  the  beauty  of  the  rivers  will  call  those  left  behind 
to  remembrance.  Let  all  my  wealth  and  grain  be  sent  with 
Rama  to  the  uninhabited  forest.  Observing  sacrifices  with  the 
sages  in  sacred  places,  bestowing  alms  upon  them,  Shri  Rama 
will  dwell  there  happily.  Prince  Bharata  will  govern  the  people 
here  and  Rama  set  out  abundantly  provided." 

Kaikeyi  was  seized  with  fear  on  hearing  the  words  of  the  king, 
her  mouth  dried  up  and  she  was  unable  to  speak.  Trembling 
with  agitation,  she  then  said :  "  O  Chief  of  men,  Bharata  will 
not  accept  the  kingdom  stripped  of  its  wealth  and  people, 
resembling  unfermented  wine." 

The  eyes  of  the  king  reddened  with  anger  at  the  cruel  and 
240 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

shameless  words  of  Kaikeyi,  and  he  replied :  "  O  Wicked 
Wretch,  why  dost  thou  seek  to  crush  me  with  this  load  of  sorrow  ? 
When  thou  didst  demand  Rama's  exile,  thou  didst  not  add 
he  should  go  empty  handed  ?  " 

At  the  king's  words,  the  fury  of  Kaikeyi  was  redoubled, 
and  she  said :  "  Of  thy  dynasty,  King  Sagara  sent  his  son 
Asumanjas  into  exile.  Let  Rama  depart  in  the  same 
manner." 

At  these  words,  King  Dasaratha  cried,  "  Woe,  alas !  "  and 
all  the  people  felt  ashamed,  but  Kaikeyi  remained  unmoved. 
Then  the  chief  minister,  Siddhartha  by  name,  a  virtuous 
man,  much  favoured  by  King  Dasaratha,  addressed  Kaikeyi, 
saying :  "  O  Lady,  Asumanjas,  seizing  the  children  playing  in 
the  street,  threw  them  into  the  river  Sarayu,  for  this  he  was 
considered  an  exceedingly  wicked  man.  The  people  of  the  city, 
disgusted  with  his  cruel  deeds,  entreated  King  Sagara  to  banish 
him,  saying :  '  Wilt  thou  preserve  us  or  Prince  Asumanjas  in 
the  city  ? '  King  Sagara  enquired  of  them  the  cause  of  their 
fear  and  they  said  in  reply :  *  Prince  Ansumanjas  has  become 
insane,  catching  our  children  while  at  play  and  throwing  them 
into  the  river ;  he  rejoices  in  this  act.'  King  Sagara,  therefore, 
abandoned  his  malevolent  son  and  placing  him  on  a  carriage 
with  his  wife,  clothing  and  other  necessities,  proclaimed  : 
'Asumanjas  is  banished  for  life.'  Asumanjas,  armed  with  an  axe 
and  basket,  wandered  about  in  the  forest  and  reaped  the  fruit 
of  his  evil  deeds.  The  righteous  Maharajah  Sagara  banished 
his  son  on  account  of  his  evil  conduct  but,  O  Queen,  what 
wrong  has  Rama  done  that  he  should  be  exiled  by  thee  ?  I  see 
no  fault  in  Rama.  It  were  as  easy  to  find  a  taint  in  the  moon ! 
O  Lady,  if  thou  hast  found  any  fault  with  Rama,  then  declare  it 
openly  and  he  will  be  banished  from  the  kingdom.  O  Kaikeyi, 
it  is  an  unrighteous  act  to  abandon  one  following  the  path  of 
virtue,  without  substantial  reason  ;  such  an  act  would  destroy 
the  splendour  of  Xndra  himself.  O  Lady  of  Beautiful 
Countenance,  do  not  destroy  the  prosperity  of  Shri  Rama- 
chandra  and  become  a  source  of  ignominy  to  the  people." 
Hearing  the  words  of  the  minister  Siddhartha,  King  Dasaratha, 
overcome  with  grief,  spoke  to  Kaikeyi,  in  broken  accents  and 
said :  "  O  Sinful  One,  dost  thou  disregard  the  words  of  my 
241 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

minister  ?  Art  thou  blind  to  thine  own  welfare  and  mine  ? 
Art  thou  determined  to  follow  the  evil  path  ?  Giving  up  my 
wealth  and  substance  and  the  comforts  of  the  palace,  I  will 
follow  Rama.     Do  thou  rule  at  ease  with  Bharata  for  ever." 


CHAPTER    37 

Despite  the  instruction  of  Vasishtha,  Shri  Sita  still  desires 
to  enter  the  forest 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  chief  minister  Siddhartha  and  those 
of  the  king,  the  gentle  prince  humbly  made  the  following  reply : 
"  O  King,  having  renounced  all  pleasures  to  live  on  the  products 
of  the  forest,  what  need  have  I  for  wealth,  an  army  or  other 
requisites  ?  Who  will  concern  himself  with  the  ropes  binding 
the  howdah  to  the  elephant  when  he  has  parted  with  the 
elephant?  O  Great  One,  such  am  I,  what  occasion  have  I 
for  an  army  in  the  forest  ?  Let  it  be  given  to  Prince  Bharata, 
Bring  me  garments  of  bark.  I  go  to  pass  fourteen  years  in 
the  forest,  and  need  but  a  spade  to  dig  for  roots  and  fruit 
and  a  creel  and  basket.    I  wish  to  start  without  further  delay." 

Hearing  his  words,  Kaikeyi  rose  up  and  brought  the  robes 
of  bark,  and  in  the  midst  of  the  assembly  without  shame, 
addressed  Prince  Rama  saying  :  "  Put  them  on." 

Shri  Ramachandra  receiving  the  raiment  from  Kaikeyi, 
discarding  his  rich  apparel,  put  on  the  dress  of  bark.  Shri 
Lakshmana  also  putting  off  his  beautiful  robes,  put  on  the  dress 
of  an  ascetic  in  the  presence  of  his  father.  Shri  Sita  dressed  in 
a  lovely  silken  sari,  seeing  the  robes  of  bark  proffered  her, 
was  startled,  like  a  doe  at  the  sight  of  the  fowler's  snare. 

The  Princess  Janaki,  endowed  with  excellent  qualities, 
received  the  bark  dress,  in  shame  and  distress.  Versed  in  the 
duties  of  a  faithful  spouse,  she,  addressing  her  god-like  husband, 
her  eyes  suffused  with  tears,  said :  "  How  do  the  ascetics  put 
on  the  robes  of  bark  ?  " 

Shri  Sita,  ignorant  of  the  custom,  remained  confused. 
242 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

Unskilled  in  the  art  of  wearing  robes  of  bark,  putting  one  end 
of  the  vestment  round  her  neck  and  holding  the  other  in  her 
hands,  she  stood  perplexed.  Then  Ramachandra,  chief  of  the 
good,  approaching  the  princess,  fastened  the  robe  of  bark  over 
her  silken  sari.  All  the  ladies  of  the  court,  perceiving  Rama 
assisting  Sita  in  putting  on  the  dress  of  bark,  began  to  weep 
and  timidly  addressed  the  illustrious  Rama  :  "  O  Beloved  Prince, 
thy  father  has  not  granted  Shri  Sita  permission  to  enter  the 
forest.  Do  thou  enter  the  forest  in  accordance  with  the  king's 
behest,  but  let  not  Janaki  go  with  thee,  Let  our  life  be  fruitful 
beholding  her  face.  Let  Lakshmana  go  with  thee  for  thy 
protection,  but  the  beautiful  Sita  is  not  fitted  to  dwell  in  the 
forest  like  an  ascetic.  O  Rama,  prompted  by  dharma,  go 
without  delay  as  thou  desirest  but,  we  entreat  thee,  leave 
Princess  Sita  with  us." 

Shri  Rama,  knowing  that  Sita  was  not  willing  to  stay  there 
in  his  absence,  disregarding  the  request,  helped  Sita  to  don 
the  bark  raiment.  Shri  Vasishtha,  the  king's  preceptor,  seeing 
Sita  attired  in  the  habit  of  an  ascetic,  was  displeased,  and  said 
to  Kaikeyi :  "  O  Destroyer  of  thy  Dynasty,  O  Evil-minded 
Kaikeyi,  thou  hast  deceived  the  king  and  now  exceed  the  boons 
granted  to  thee,  thou  art  dead  to  all  good  sense.  It  is  not 
for  Princess  Sita  to  enter  the  forest,  let  her  rule  in  the  place 
of  Rama  till  he  return.  The  wife  is,  as  it  were,  half  of  her 
spouse,  therefore,  what  is  his  due  is  hers  also.  Shri  Sita  being 
the  half  of  Shri  Rama  is  in  his  absence  entitled  to  the  throne. 
Should  Shri  Sita  accompany  Rama,  then  I  and  all  the  people 
of  Ayodhya  will  follow  him.  Where  Rama  goes  with  Sita, 
there  will  follow  the  guards,  the  people  of  the  kingdom  and 
the  citizens  of  the  capital.  Yea,  even  Prince  Bharata  and 
Prince  Shatraghuna,  assuming  the  robes  of  ascetics  will  accom- 
pany their  elder  brother.  Then  this  kingdom  abandoned  by 
men,  peopled  by  trees  alone,  will  be  governed  by  thee,  O  Thou, 
bent  on  the  destruction  of  thy  subjects.  Know  well,  that  is 
no  kingdom  where  Shri  Rama  is  not  king,  but  the  forest  in 
which  Rama  dwells  becomes  the  kingdom.  The  king  unwillingly 
consenting,  may  bestow  the  kingdom  on  Bharata,  but  Bharata 
will  never  accept  the  crown,  nor  will  he  honour  thee  as  his 
mother,  if  he  be  the  true  son  of  King  Dasaratha.  Even  if  thou 
243 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

sliouldst  die,  yet  will  Prince  Bharata,  acquainted  with  the 
ancient  law,  refuse  to  rule  the  kingdom  as  long  as  his  elder 
brother,  Shri  Ramachandra  lives.  Thou,  desiring  the  advance- 
ment of  thy  son,  Bharata,  seeking  to  make  him  king,  art  in 
reality  bringing  him  to  grief,  since  all  will  follow  Shri 
Ramachandra.  O  Kaikeyi,  thou  shalt  see  beasts,  snakes,  deer, 
birds  and  even  trees,  bend  before  Rama,  swayed  by  his  love, 
not  to  speak  of  men.  O  Lady,  remove  the  dress  of  bark  and 
let  Sita  be  attired  in  royal  robes,  the  ascetic's  garb  ill  befits  her." 

The  Guru  Vasishtha  forbade  Sita  to  don  the  robe  of  bark 
and  said  to  the  queen :  "  O  Daughter  of  the  King  Kaikeya, 
thou  hast  demanded  the  exile  of  Rama  alone,  let  Sita  be  clad 
in  royal  robes  when  accompanying  Rama.  The  boon  exacted 
by  thee  did  not  imply  the  exile  of  Shri  Sita,  therefore,  let  the 
princess,  beautifully  arrayed  and  adorned,  enter  the  forest  in 
a  royal  chariot." 

Despite  the  instruction  of  the  resplendent  sage,  chief  among 
the  brahmins  and  the  king's  preceptor,  Shri  Sita,  not  relinquish- 
ing the  ascetic's  dress,  desired  to  enter  the  forest,  attired  like 
her  lord. 


CHAPTER     38 

Shri  Rama  requests  the  king  to  protect  his  mother  during  his 
absence 

Seeing  Sita,  like  a  widow  though  possessing  a  husband,  putting 
on  the  habit  of  bark,  all  the  people  present  condemned  King 
Dasaratha.  The  king  hearing  their  murmuring  lost  all  interest 
in  life,  virtue  and  fame,  formerly  cherished  by  him.  Sighing 
deeply,  he  said  to  his  consort  Kaikeyi : — 

"  O  Kaikeyi,  it  is  unfitting  for  Sita  to  enter  the  forest  wearing 
the  habit  of  an  ascetic.  Our  holy  Guru  Vasishtha  has  spoken 
truly.  Sita  is  not  fitted  for  life  in  the  forest,  that  frail  princess 
is  worthy  of  perpetual  happiness.  Has  the  daughter  of  the  great 
Emperor  Janaka  caused  injury  to  any,  that  amidst  the  people 
244 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

she  stands  mute,  dressed  in  a  robe  of  bark,  like  an  ascetic  ? 
I  gave  no  promise  that  the  daughter  of  King  Janaka  should  put 
on  the  dress  of  a  devotee.  Let  this  princess  enter  the  forest  attired 
in  an  auspicious  manner,  with  all  her  ornaments.  My  death  is 
not  far  distant  and  my  mind  is  in  confusion ;  by  promising 
these  boons  to  thee,  I  have  been  brought  to  nought.  This  act  is 
consuming  me  as  is  the  bamboo  by  its  flowering.1  If  it  be  said 
that  Shri  Rama  has  done  thee  injury,  O  Sinful  One,  what  barm 
did  Janaki  ever  do  to  thee  ?  Of  what  dost  thou  accuse  the 
daughter  of  King  Janaka,  whose  eyes  resemble  the  gazelle's 
and  who  is  meek  and  gentle. 

"  O  Wicked  One,  by  sending  Rama  without  reason  to  the 
forest,  thou  shall  assuredly  enter  hell ;  what  else  will  not  befall 
thee  on  account  of  thy  evil  deeds  ? 

"  When  Shri  Rama  approached  me  on  the  eve  of  his  installa- 
tion, then  didst  thou  forbid  him  to  inaugurate  the  ceremony 
and  charged  him  to  enter  the  forest  with  matted  locks  in  an 
ascetic's  garb.  By  my  silence,  I  gave  consent,  but  now,  desirous 
of  plunging  thyself  into  hell  thou  requirest  Sita  to  enter  the 
forest  robed  in  the  habit  of  a  recluse." 

King  Dasaratha,  lamenting,  saw  no  end  to  his  distress.  At 
length,  helpless  and  overcome  with  grief,  on  account  of  his  son, 
he  fell  to  the  ground. 

Shri  Rama,  his  head  bowed,  ready  to  enter  the  forest, 
observing  his  father's  distress,  said:  "O  King,  my  mother 
Kaushalya,  devoted  to  her  lord,  aged  and  of  a  generous 
disposition,  who  never  speaks  ill  of  any,  bereft  of  me  will  be 
drowned  in  a  sea  of  sorrow.  She  who  has  hitherto  known  no 
suffering  is  now  worthy  of  thy  special  regard.  O  Father,  thou 
to  whom  honour  is  due,  regard  my  mother  with  affectionate 
attention,  that  she  may  not  suffer  in  the  separation  from  her  son 
and  the  bearing  of  many  woes,  but  live  dependent  on  thee. 
O  Emperor,  equal  to  Indra  in  power,  protect  my  mother  in 
my  absence  that  she  may  not  languish  and  die."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     39 

As  they  prepare  far  departure  the  palace  resounds  with  grief 

Hearing  the  words  of  Rama  and  beholding  him  in  the  guise 
of  an  ascetic,  the  king  lost  consciousness  and  his  consorts  turned 
away  in  distress.  Overcome  with  grief,  the  wretched  monarch 
could  neither  look  on  Rama  nor  utter  a  word  to  him  and  for 
a  space  remained  insensible.  Then,  regaining  consciousness, 
the  long-armed  king,  remembering  Rama,  began  to  lament : 
"  Now,  without  doubt,  I  know  that  in  some  previous  birth, 
I  separated  many  calves  from  their  mothers  and  deprived  many 
beings  of  their  lives,  on  account  of  which  all  this  has  befallen 
me.  The  vital  airs  do  not  leave  the  body  before  the  appointed 
time ;  though  tormented  by  Kaikeyi,  yet  death  does  not  claim 
me.  Alas  !  I  behold  Shri  Ramachandra,  resplendent  as  fire, 
divested  of  his  royal  robes  and  attired  in  ascetic's  garb.  This 
evil  caused  by  Kaikeyi,  through  guile  and  the  desire  for  personal 
advantage  is  the  source  of  universal  distress." 

The  king's  eyes  were  suffused  with  tears  and  crying :  "  Rama, 
Rama,"  his  throat  choked,  and  he  could  utter  no  more.  After 
some  time,  still  shedding  tears,  he  addressed  Sumantra,  saying : 
"  Yoke  the  best  steeds  to  the  chariot  and  convey  Shri  Rama 
out  of  the  city.  Now  it  is  made  clear  that  a  man's  virtue  leads 
him  into  affliction,  since  so  wise  and  valiant  a  son  is  being 
banished  by  his  parents." 

As  instructed  by  the  king,  Sumantra  yoked  the  most  excellent 
of  steeds  to  a  richly  decorated  chariot  and  bringing  the  golden 
car  with  the  best  steeds  yoked  thereto,  before  the  prince, 
said  humbly  :  "  The  chariot  is  at  hand." 

The  king  then  summoned  his  upright  and  trustworthy 
treasurer  and  spoke  to  him  in  words  suitable  to  the  place  and 
time :  "  Bring  hither  for  Janaki,  costly  apparel  and  ornaments 
to  serve  the  princess  for  fourteen  years."  As  instructed  by 
the  king,  the  master  of  the  treasury  brought  the  various  articles 
and  delivered  them  to  Princess  Sita.  The  highly  born  Sita, 
attiring  herself  in  a  sumptuous  robe  and  ornaments,  made  ready 
to  depart  for  die  forest.  Thus  attired,  Shri  Janaki  illumined 
the  palace  as  the  rays  of  the  rising  sun  illumine  the  sky. 
246 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

Queen  Kaushalya  embraced  the  princess  of  virtuous  conduct 
to  her  bosom  and  blessing  her  said :  "  The  world  is  filled  with 
undutiful  wives,  who  cease  to  regard  their  lord  when  he  has 
fallen  into  distress.  Such  is  the  nature  of  those  who  having 
enjoyed  great  pleasures,  on  finding  their  consort  involved  in 
trouble,  condemn  and  sometimes  even  abandon  him.  Many  are 
the  women,  untruthful,  heartless,  unchaste,  devious1  and  vain, 
full  of  evil  passions,  the  destroyers  of  long-honoured  ties. 
Neither  a  worthy  family  nor  duty,  nor  the  instruction  of  the 
Guru,  nor  gifts,  sway  them,  nor  do  they  honour  the  marriage 
ties,  their  minds  being  fickle.  But  those  women  devoted  to 
their  husbands,  of  virtuous  conduct,  honouring  the  tradition 
of  their  family,  truthful,  following  the  instructions  of  then- 
preceptor,  regard  their  lord  as  the  chief  of  men.  Therefore, 
do  not  condemn  my  son,  now  ready  to  enter  the  forest,  who 
should  be  regarded  by  thee  rather  as  a  deity,  whether  in  poverty 
or  prosperity.** 

Shri  Sita,  understanding  the  import  of  these  words,  inspired 
by  dhanna,  humbly  replied :  O  Noble  Lady,  I  will  fulfil  thy 
commands.  It  is  known  to  me  that  a  woman  should  serve 
her  lord,  and  my  parents  have  instructed  me  in  the  matter. 
Do  not  deem  me  a  false  woman.  I  am  as  unable  to  forsake 
the  path  of  virtue  as  the  sun's  light  the  moon.  As  a  lute  is 
useless  without  strings,  as  a  chariot  cannot  move  without  wheels, 
so  is  a  wife  bereft  of  her  husband,  even  if  she  have  a  hundred 
sons. 

"  Father,  mother  or  son  can  give  but  a  small  measure  of 
happiness,  but  a  husband  is  the  source  of  limitless  joy.  What 
woman  is  so  unworthy  that  she  will  not  obey  her  husband  ? 
I  am  acquainted  with  all  the  duties  of  a  wife,  being  instructed  by 
those  eminent  in  virtue.  A  husband  is  as  a  god  to  his  consort, 
never  shall  I  not  honour  him." 

The  simple-hearted  queen,  shedding  tears  of  distress  on 
account  of  the  separation  from  her  son,  hearing  Princess  Sita's 
words,  was  comforted. 

Then  Rama  said :  "  O  Mother,  when  I  am  in  the  forest, 
do  not  look  on  my  father  with  a  reproachful  countenance,  the 
term  of  my  exile  will  soon  be  ended.    The  fourteen  years  will

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 
pass  like  a  dream.    Surrounded  by  my  friends,  thou  shalt  behold 
me  soring  my  sire." 

Speaking  thus  to  his  mother  Kaushalya,  Shri  Rama  reflected 
how  to  address  the  three  hundred  and  fifty  other  consorts  of 
the  king.  To  these  who  were  bitterly  lamenting,  he  spoke  with 
humility.  "While  living  amongst  you,  if  I  have  ever,  in 
ignorance,  offended  you,  be  gracious  enough  to  pardon  me." 
These  pious  and  humble  words  of  Rama,  inspired  by  dharma, 
touched  the  hearts  of  the  queens,  causing  them  to  shed  tears 
and  their  lamentations  resembled  the  sound  of  krouncha  birds. 

The  palace  of  the  king,  formerly  resounding  to  the  beating 
of  drums  resembling  the  crash  of  thunder,  was  to-day  filled 
with  the  wailing  of  the  sorrow-stricken  queens. 


CHAPTER     40 

All  Ayodhya  is  distressed  to  see  Shri  Rama's  chariot  depart 

Shri  Rama  overcome  with  grief,  touched  the  feet  of  his  sovereign 
and  bowing  down,  with  Lakshmana  and  Sita,  circumambulated 
the  king.  Having  taken  leave  of  his  sire,  Rama  with  Sita  paid 
reverence  to  the  sorrow-stricken  Queen  Kaushalya. 

Then  Shri  Lakshmana  bowed  before  the  Queen  Kaushalya 
and  embraced  the  feet  of  his  mother  Sumitra.  His  mother 
weeping,  desiring  her  son's  good,  blessed  Lakshmana  and  said  : 
"  O  My  Son,  Shri  Rama  was  born  of  Queen  Kaushalya  for  the 
protection  of  the  world,  and  I  have  borne  thee  so  that,  devoted 
to  Shri  Rama,  thou  shouldst  accompany  him  to  the  forest.  O 
My  Son,  do  not  neglect  the  service  of  Shri  Rama.  O  Sinless 
One,  whether  in  fortune  or  in  adversity,  regard  him  as  thy  life  I 
It  is  the  duty  of  the  good  to  be  subject  to  their  elders.  The 
tradition  of  thy  dynasty  is  the  giving  of  charity,  the  performance 
of  sacrifice,  death  on  the  field  of  battle  and  implicit  regard  for 
thine  elders." 

Speaking  thus,  Sumitra  seeing  Rama  ready  to  depart  for  the 
forest,  again  and  again  exhorted  Lakshmana  in  this  wise :  "  O 
248 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

My  Son,  enter  the  forest  with  Rama.  O  Child,  have  no  anxiety, 
do  not  grieve  either  for  thy  father,  mother,  home  or  country, 
esteem  Rama  to  be  Dasaratha,  Janaki  as  myself  and  the  forest 
equal  to  Ayodhya." 

Sumantra  now  addressed  Rama  with  humility  as  Matali1 
addresses  Indra :  "  O  Illustrious  Prince,  be  pleased  to  mount 
the  chariot,  I  will  take  thee  wheresoever  thou  desirest.  Let 
the  period  of  thine  exile  enjoined  by  Kaikeyi  begin  to-day." 

Then  the  beautiful  daughter  of  King  Janaka,  adorned  with 
the  jewels,  bestowed  on  her  by  the  king,  cheerfully  mounted 
the  waiting  vehicle,  which  shone  like  the  sun.  Shri  Rama  and 
Lakshmana  also  swiftly  ascended  the  chariot  enriched  with  gold 
and  weapons. 

Having  regard  to  the  period  of  exile,  King  Dasaratha  had 
bestowed  on  his  daughter-in-law,  robes  and  jewels  and  ordered 
arms  and  mantra-charged  weapons,  armour  and  shields  to  be 
placed  on  the  chariot.  Seeing  that  all  were  mounted,  Sumantra 
set  the  chariot  in  motion  guiding  the  horses  swift  as  the  wind. 
Rama  having  started  for  the  Dandaka  forest,  the  whole  city, 
young  and  old,  men  and  women,  soldiers,  elephants  and  horses, 
distracted  and  full  of  indignation  and  distress,  became  as  beings 
demented.  The  loosing  of  elephants,  and  the  loud  neighing  of 
horses  filled  Ayodhya  with  tumult  and  ferment.  Young  and 
old,  distraught,  ran  after  the  chariot  of  Rama  as  men  overpowered 
by  the  sun  plunge  into  water.  Some  running  beside  the  royal 
car,  some  behind  looking  up  towards  Rama,  others  weeping 
and  lamenting,  cried  to  Sumantra :  "  O  Charioteer,  drive  slowly, 
draw  in  thy  steeds,  so  that  we  may  see  the  face  of  Rama  so  soon 
to  be  hidden  from  us.  Surely  the  heart  of  his  mother  must  be 
made  of  steel  that  it  did  not  break  on  seeing  the  godlike  prince 
departing  for  the  forest.  Great  indeed  is  Shri  Sita,  who  follows 
her  husband  like  a  shadow,  as  the  light  of  the  sun  that  never 
forsakes  the  Meru  mountain.  O  Lakshmana,  perfect  art  thou, 
constantly  serving  thine  amiable  and  godlike  brother.  This  is 
perfection,  this  is  prosperity,  thus  to  attend  thy  brother  is  the 
way  to  heaven." 

Thus  lamenting,  following  the  chariot  of  Rama,  the  people 
could  not  restrain  their  tears.    The  afflicted  and  wretched

THE    R<AMAYANA    OF    VALMJIKI 

monarch,  King  Dasaratha,  overcome  with  grief,  coming  forth 
from  the  palace  barefooted,  surrounded  by  his  queens,  cried 
out :  "  I  must  again  behold  my  beloved  son."  Then  he  heard 
the  lament  of  the  women  wailing  like  she  elephants  when  their 
mates  axe  bound  in  chains,  and  like  the  full  moon  in  eclipse, 
King  Dasaratha  was  bereft  of  bis  splendour. 

Shri  Rama,  free  from  anxiety,  urged  the  charioteer  on,  saying  : 
"  Faster !  faster  !  "  and  as  he  spoke,  enjoining  Sumantra  to 
drive  more  speedily,  the  people  cried,  *'  Stay,  stay  ",  so  that 
the  charioteer  knew  not  how  to  obey  both  commands.  The  dust 
raised  by  the  wheels  of  Rama's  chariot  was  laid  by  the  tears 
of  the  people.  As  Shri  Rama  left  the  city,  the  people  weeping 
and  bewildered  were  distraught,  the  tears  of  the  women  falling 
like  drops  of  water  on  lotus  leaves,  when  fishes  leap.  The 
people  following  Rama's  chariot  and  perceiving  the  anguish 
of  the  king,  wept  in  sympathy.  A  great  tumult  now  arose 
from  the  ladies  of  the  palace  and  the  king's  attendants  all 
weeping  and  crying,  "  O  Rama  !  O  Kaushalya !  "  and  hearing 
the  wailing  and  lamentation  of  the  people  Shri  Rama  looked 
back  and  beheld  the  king  and  his  mother  Kaushalya,  bare- 
footed, following  his  chariot,  and  was  filled  with  sorrow. 
Shri  Rama,  bound  by  the  cord  of  duty,  turned  his  eyes  from 
his  parents,  as  a  foal  not  permitted  to  follow  its  dam.  Perceiving 
his  royal  parents,  unacquainted  with  suffering,  worthy  of 
excellent  chariots,  running  barefooted  towards  him,  he  said  to 
Sumantra :  "  Drive  on  speedily !  "  unable  to  bear  the  sight 
of  his  parents'  distress,  as  an  elephant  is  unable  to  bear  the  goad. 
His  mother  Kaushalya  trembling  and  tottering,  ran  towards  him, 
like  a  cow  hearing  the  cries  of  her  calf  that  has  been  bound, 
crying,  "  O  Rama !  O  Sita  !  O  Lakshmana  !  "  The  king 
calling,  M  Stay  !  Stay !  "  to  the  charioteer,  with  Rama  crying, 
"  Go  forward  speedily  ",  caused  the  heart  of  Sumantra  to  be 
riven,  like  one  standing  between  two  rival  armies. 

On  this,  Rama  addressed  him,  saying  :  "  On  thy  return  to  the 
palace,  when  charged  by  the  king  with  disobeying  his  commands, 
do  thou  say :  'Amidst  the  noise  of  the  rolling  wheels,  I  was 
unable  to  hear.'  Further  delay  will  prove  calamitous."  Shri 
Sumantra  regarding  the  words  of  the  prince,  signalling  the 
people  following  to  return,  urged  the  horses  on. 
250 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

The  chariot  outstripping  the  king,  caused  him  to  halt  with 
his  household  and  mentally  circumambulating  Rama,  he  returned 
to  the  palace.  The  courtiers  now  said  to  the  king :  *'  None 
follows  a  friend  far,  whom  he  wishes  to  see  return."  King 
Dasaratha  hearing  this  injunction,  bathed  in  perspiration,  utterly 
wretched,  stood  gazing  at  the  receding  chariot. 


CHAPTER    41 

The  whole  world  grieves  for  Prince  Rama 

THAT  Lion  among  men,  Prince  Ramachandra,  having  in  humility 
departed,  a  great  cry  of  distress  arose  among  the  ladies  of  the 
inner  apartment.  They  cried :  "  Where  is  Ramachandra,  the 
only  asylum  and  refuge  of  the  orphaned,  the  weak  and  the 
suffering  ?  Where  is  Prince  Rama,  who  when  provoked,  showed 
no  anger,  who  caused  no  agitation  to  any  heart,  who  appeased 
those  who  were  wrathful,  and  considered  others'  distress  as  his 
own  ?  Where  is  that  Rama  now,  who  treated  us  with  the  same 
regard  as  he  showed  his  illustrious  mother,  Queen  Kaushalya  ? 
Where  is  he  wandering  now,  that  Rama,  Protector  of  the  World, 
who  has  gone  to  the  forest,  persecuted  by  Kaikeyi,  and  exiled 
by  his  father  ?  O,  how  insensible  the  king  has  grown,  that  he 
has  sent  the  virtuous  and  truthful  Rama,  the  object  of  universal 
love,  into  exile."  In  this  way,  all  the  ladies  of  the  court  wept 
aloud  like  cows  who  have  been  bereft  of  their  calves.  The  king 
overwhelmed  with  grief  on  account  of  separation  from  his  son, 
suffered  increasingly  on  hearing  the  loud  and  piteous  cries  of 
the  ladies  of  the  palace.  On  the  prince's  departure,  no  brahma- 
chari  performed  the  fire  ceremony,  no  householder  prepared  food 
but  passed  the  day  in  deep  distress.  The  elephants  cast  off 
their  trappings  and  the  cows  refused  to  nourish  their  calves, 
mothers  showed  no  delight  at  the  sight  of  their  first-born. 
Trishanku,  Mars,  Jupiter,  Saturn  and  Venus  and  other  in- 
auspicious planets  gathered  round  the  moon,  pulsating  there ; 
the  stars  lost  their  brilliance  and  the  planets  their  splendour. 
251 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Vishaka,1  growing  dim,  was  scarcely  distinguishable  in  the  sky. 
The  clouds,  driven  by  a  strong  wind,  overtaking  each  other, 
resembled  waves  rising  in  the  sea.  When  Shri  Rama  departed, 
an  earthquake  caused  the  city  to  tremble,  the  ten  cardinal  points 
were  covered  in  darkness,  neither  were  the  planets  nor  the  stars 
visible.  All  the  inhabitants  of  the  city  were  overwhelmed  with 
misery,  none  partook  of  food  that  day  or  found  pleasure  in  any 
pastime.  All  the  people  of  Ayodhya,  sighing  heavily,  were  filled 
with  sorrow  and  grieved  for  the  king.  Those  walking  in  the 
streets  wept  and  nowhere  was  there  any  sign  of  joy.  No 
cool  breezes  blew,  nor  did  the  moon  shine,  the  rays  of  the  sun 
were  weak  and  the  whole  world  mourned  for  Rama.  Sons 
gave  no  thought  to  their  parents,  husbands  were  indifferent  to 
their  wives  and  brothers  showed  no  affection  to  each  other ; 
all  were  sunk  in  grief.  The  friends  of  Rama,  unconscious  of 
themselves  and  filled  with  distress,  were  bereft  of  sleep.  Without 
Rama,  Ayodhya  resembled  the  earth  with  all  its  mountains, 
suffering  from  drought.  Every  household  was  consumed  with 
grief  and  the  cries  of  elephants,  horses  and  warriors  filled  the  city. 


chapter   42 

Without  Rama  the  king's  heart  finds  no  rest 

So  long  as  the  dust  raised  by  the  wheels  of  Rama's  chariot  could 
be  seen,  so  long  did  the  king  not  withdraw  his  gaze  from  the 
way.  So  long  as  King  Dasaratha  could  see  his  beloved  and 
most  virtuous  son,  Shri  Ramachandra,  so  long  did  he  stand 
gazing  after  him,  and  when  the  dust  was  no  more  visible, 
the  wretched  monarch,  stricken  with  grief  fell  to  the  earth. 
Then  Queen  Kaushalya  taking  hold  of  his  right  hand  and 
Queen  Kaikeyi  his  left,  ministered  to  him.  The  virtuous  and 
upright  king  beholding  Queen  Kaikeyi  near  him,  said :  "  O 
Wicked  Queen,  touch  me  not,  I  do  not  desire  to  see  thy 
countenance.    Thou  art  neither  my  consort,  nor  do  I  desire 

1  Vishaka — a  lunar  aitritm,  appearing  in  October. 
252 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

relationship  with  thee ;  thy  servants  are  no  longer  my  servants, 
nor  am  I  their  master.  Thou,  who  hast  abandoned  obedience 
to  thy  lord,  I  now  repudiate.  Thy  hand,  accepted  by  me 
when  circumambulating  the  sacred  fire,  I  relinquish,  and 
renounce  the  worldly  and  spiritual  pledges  given  thee  in  the 
ceremony.  If  Bharata,  receiving  this  kingdom,  is  satisfied, 
then  let  him  not  perform  my  obsequies." 

Queen  Kaushalya,  torn  with  grief,  raised  the  king,  soiled  with 
dust,  and  conveyed  him  to  bis  chariot.  The  king  sorely  afflicted, 
remembering  his  son  in  ascetic's  garb,  resembled  one  who  has 
murdered  a  brahmin  or  touches  a  blazing  fire  with  his  naked 
hand.  Turning  again  and  again  towards  the  path  that  the 
chariot  had  taken,  the  king's  countenance  resembled  the  sun 
in  eclipse.  Conceiving  his  son  Rama  to  have  passed  beyond 
the  city  boundary,  and  thinking  of  him,  he  again  gave  way 
to  grief,  crying :  "  I  see  the  marks  of  the  hoofs  of  the  horses 
that  were  yoked  to  the  chariot  of  my  son,  but  him  I  do  not  see. 
Alas  !  My  Son,  who  perfumed  with  sandalpaste,  slept  on  soft 
pillows,  fanned  by  beautiful  women,  to-day  sleeps  beneath  a  tree 
with  wood  or  stone  for  his  pillow.  In  the  morning,  he  will  awake 
on  the  hard  ground,  his  mind  oppressed,  his  body  smeared 
with  dust,  sighing  deeply  like  a  bull  rising  from  beside  a  spring. 
The  dwellers  in  the  forest  will  behold  Rama  rising  like  an  orphan 
and  wandering  as  one  forlorn.  That  daughter  of  King  Janaka 
worthy  of  every  happiness,  her  feet  pierced  with  thorns,  hearing 
the  roar  of  animals  like  tigers,  will  be  struck  with  terror ;  O 
Kaikeyi,  thy  ambition  is  fulfilled,  now  rule  the  kingdom  as  a 
widow  for  I  cannot  support  life  without  the  chief  of  men." 

Thus  lamenting,  the  king  returned  to  the  capital,  like  a  man 
having  cremated  one  supremely  dear  to  him.  He  beheld  courts 
and  houses  deserted,  the  markets  forsaken  and  the  temples  closed, 
while  on  the  royal  highway  only  the  feeble  and  afflicted 
were  to  be  seen.  Seeing  the  city  desolate  and  remembering 
Shri  Rama,  weeping  bitterly,  the  king  entered  the  palace  as  the 
sun  enters  a  cloud.  As  the  presence  of  an  eagle  deprives  a  lake 
of  its  serpents,  rendering  it  still,  so  did  the  capital  appear  when 
Shri  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sita  had  gone  into  exile. 

Then  the  king  in  distress,  his  throat  choked  with  grief,  spoke 
in  faint  and  trembling  accents :  "  Take  me  speedily  to  the  palace 
253 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIK1 

of  Queen  Kaushalya,  the  mother  of  Rama,  nowhere  else  can  I 
obtain  peace." 

The  attendants  carried  the  king  to  the  apartments  of  Queen 
Kaushalya  and  placed  him  on  a  couch,  but  the  king's  heart 
could  find  no  rest ;  the  palace  without  Rama,  Lakshmana  and 
Ska  appeared  to  him  like  the  sky  bereft  of  the  moon.  Finding 
no  delight  there,  the  king  lifting  up  bis  hands,  cried :  "  O 
My  Son,  O  Rama,  art  thou  leaving  me  ?  How  blessed  are  they 
who  seeing  Rama  return,  will  embrace  him." 

Finding  the  night  dark,  resembling  the  hour  of  death,  the  king 
at  midnight  thus  addressed  Kaushalya :  "  O  Kaushalya,  I  do 
not  see  thee,  my  sight  has  followed  Rama,  nor  has  it  yet  returned, 
therefore,  reach  forth  thy  hand  and  touch  me,  O  Queen." 

Seeing  her  royal  consort  merged  in  the  remembrance  of  Rama, 
the  queen,  sighing,  seated  herself  by  the  king  and  began  to 
lament  in  sympathy  with  him. 


chapter   43 

The  lament  of  Queen  Kaushalya 

Queen  Kaushalya,  deeply  afflicted  by  the  separation  from  her 
son,  seeing  the  king  lying  on  the  couch  merged  in  grief,  said : 
"  O  King,  that  evil  Kaikeyi  having  discharged  her  poison  on 
Shri  Rama,  will  wander  about  at  will,  like  a  snake  that  has  cast 
its  slough.  That  sinful  woman,  having  accomplished  her  design 
and  sent  Rama  to  the  forest  will  ever  inspire  me  with  terror, 
like  a  venomous  serpent  in  the  home.  If  her  demand  had  been 
that  Rama  should  dwell  in  the  city  on  alms  or  had  she  condemned 
him  to  be  her  slave,  it  were  better  than  exile.  She  has  cast  out 
Rama,  as  the  oblation  offered  to  the  asuras  is  cast  away  by  those 
who  tend  the  sacrificial  fire.  The  long  armed  Rama,  the  wielder 
of  the  great  bow,  walking  like  the  king  of  elephants,  must  by  now 
have  reached  the  forest  with  Sita  and  Lakshmana.  O  King, 
consider  how  thy  son  Rama,  who  has  never  before  experienced 
suffering,  is  banished  by  thee,  urged  by  Kaikeyi  1  O  What  fate 
254 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

will  befall  them  now?  Without  wealth,  exiled  in  his  youth 
when  a  king's  happiness  should  have  been  his  portion,  how  will 
he  be  able  to  live  on  roots  and  berries  in  the  forest  ?  Will  the 
time  ever  come  when  I  shall  see  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sita 
return,  putting  an  end  to  my  sorrow  ?  When  will  that  glad  day 
dawn,  when  the  illustrious  capital  rilled  with  rejoicing  crowds, 
decorated  with  flags,  banners  and  garlands,  welcomes  Rama  ? 
0  will  that  auspicious  hour  ever  strike,  when  the  citizens  hearing 
of  his  return  will  be  filled  with  gladness,  like  the  sea  at  the  time 
of  the  full  moon  ?  When  will  Shri  Rama  with  Sita,  enter  the 
city,  like  the  bull  who,  at  dusk,  preceding  the  herd  of  cows, 
returns  to  the  town.  When  will  the  people  of  the  capital, 
waiting  to  scatter  rice  over  him,  gather  in  thousands  on  the 
highways  to  welcome  Rama,  the  subduer  of  his  foes  ?  O, 
when  shall  I  see  my  sons,  resplendent  as  two  mountain  peaks, 
return  to  Ayodhya,  adorned  with  earrings,  bearing  the  sword 
and  scimitar.  When  will  the  two  princes,  circumambulating 
the  city  with  Janata,  receive  gifts  of  flowers  and  fruit  from  the 
hands  of  virgins  and  brahmins  ?  When  will  the  virtuous  and 
sagacious  Rama  run  towards  me,  leaping  like  a  child  ?  Surely 
my  love  pours  forth  for  him,  as  the  breasts  of  mothers  when 
suckling  their  infants.  O  Great  King,  because  of  this,  Kaikeyi 
has  increased  my  love  for  my  child ;  bereft  of  him,  I  am  like 
a  cow  whose  calf  has  been  forcibly  carried  away  by  a  lion. 
My  only  son  Rama  is  versed  in  all  the  classics  and  endowed 
with  every  excellent  quality ;  without  such  a  son,  I  cannot  live. 
O  Great  King,  I  cannot  sustain  life  in  the  absence  of  my  brave 
and  beloved  son ;  the  fire  of  grief  caused  by  the  separation 
from  my  son  is  consuming  me,  as  the  rays  of  the  sun  in  summer 
consume  the  surface  of  the  earth."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    44 

She  finds  peace  in  the  consolation  of  Queen  Sumtra 

The  righteous  Queen  Sumitra  hearing  the  lament  of  Queen 
Kaushalya  addressed  her  in  reasonable  words :  "  O  Queen, 
why  dost  thou  weep  in  abject  fashion,  for  thy  son,  the  chief 
of  men,  endowed  with  every  virtue  ?  O  Noble  Lady,  Shri  Rama 
has  renounced  the  throne  and  entered  the  forest  to  render  his 
father  illustrious,  as  the  votary  of  truth.  Shri  Rama,  honouring 
his  father,  has  conducted  himself  as  the  best  of  men  and  secured 
the  future  glory  of  his  sire.  There  is  no  cause  for  grief,  since 
Rama  is  treading  the  path  of  dharma,  neither  is  there  cause 
to  grieve  for  Lakshmana,  ever  compassionate  to  all,  sinless, 
serving  Rama  and  in  every  way  worthy  of  the  highest  good. 
The  tender-limbed  Janaki,  too,  is  following  thy  virtuous  son. 
O  Queen,  the  exile  of  Rama  is  no  cause  for  sorrow  since  he  is 
the  protector  of  all  beings  and  the  follower  of  virtue.  O  Queen, 
the  banner  of  bis  good  name  waves  over  the  three  worlds. 
Consider  the  purity  of  Rama ;  even  the  sun  dares  not  cause  him 
suffering  by  its  rays.  In  his  presence,  the  hot  winds  of  the  forest 
in  summer  will  grow  cool  and  like  the  spring  breeze  bring  him 
refreshment !  When  asleep  in  the  forest  at  night,  the  moon, 
like  a  father,  will  succour  him  with  its  cool  beams.  That 
Ramachandra,  to  whom  the  Brahmarishi  Vishwamitra  gave 
celestial  weapons  on  the  death  of  his  son  Shambara,  that  valorous 
son,  that  lion  among  men,  depending  on  the  strength  of  his  arms 
will  dwell  in  the  forest  as  fearlessly  as  in  his  own  palace.  That 
hero  whose  arrows  destroy  his  foes,  is  certain  to  be  succoured 
by  the  earth.  That  Rama,  endowed  with  great  prowess,  power 
and  courage,  will  soon  return  on  the  termination  of  his  exile, 
to  claim  the  kingdom.  O  Lady,  Shri  Rama,  who  illumines 
the  sun  which  gives  light  to  the  whole  world,  who  gives 
splendour  to  the  fire,  who  is  the  supreme  ruler  of  rulers,  who  is 
the  tame  of  fame  and  the  essence  of  forgiveness,  who  is  the  chief 
of  beings  j  wherever  he  dwells,  in  the  forest  or  the  city,  all  is  one 
to  him.  Shri  Rama,  this  great  hero,  will  speedily  regain  his 
kingdom,  together  with  Sita,  the  earth  and  every  prosperity. 
256 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

Shri  Rama  for  whom,  when  departing  for  the  forest,  the  people 
of  Ayodhya  filled  with  grief,  shed  tears,  will  soon  regain  the 
kingdom.  Nought  is  difficult  to  obtain  in  the  world  by  him, 
who,  though  invincible,  entered  the  forest,  dressed  like  an  ascetic, 
followed  by  Sita,  who  is  Lakshmi1  in  another  form. 

"  What  should  be  difficult  for  him,  who,  armed  with  bow 
and  sword,  is  preceded  on  his  way  by  Lakshmana  ?  O  Lady, 
abandon  grief  and  infatuation,  assuredly  thou  wilt  behold  Shri 
Rama  returning  from  his  exile.  O  Thou  who  art  irreproachable, 
O  Kalyani,  O  Auspicious  One,  thou  wilt  behold  thy  son  like 
the  rising  moon,  placing  his  head  at  thy  feet.  Thou  wilt  shed 
tears  of  joy,  seeing  thy  son  installed  on  the  throne  and  in 
possession  of  the  king's  treasury.  O  Lady,  neither  grieve  nor 
let  thy  mind  be  troubled,  I  see  nought  that  is  inauspicious  in 
respect  of  Rama.  Soon  thou  shalt  behold  thy  son  with  Sita 
and  Lakshmana.  O  Sinless  Queen,  it  becomes  thee  to  encourage 
others,  therefore,  why  dost  thou  now  cause  thy  heart  distress  ? 
O  Devi,  do  not  grieve,  there  is  none  in  the  world  more  virtuous 
than  Rama.  Seeing  Rama  returning  from  the  forest  with  his 
friends,  making  obeisance  to  thee,  then  wilt  thou  shed  tears 
of  joy,  like  the  clouds  in  the  rainy  season.  In  brief,  I  tell  thee, 
thy  son  Shri  Rama,  returning  to  the  capital,  will  press  thy  feet 
to  him  with  his  tender  bands.  Seeing  thy  son  bowing  to  thy 
feet  thou  wilt  cover  him  with  tears  as  the  clouds  cover  the 
mountains  with  rain." 

Thus  did  the  beautiful  Sumitra,  ever  persuasive  and  benevo- 
lent to  all,  offer  words  of  consolation  to  the  Queen  Kaushalya 
and  having  spoken,  became  silent.  The  chief  queen,  the  mother 
of  Shri  Rama,  hearing  the  words  of  Queen  Sumitra,  found  peace 
and  forgot  her  grief  which  resembled  the  rain  of  the  autumn 
clouds  that  swiftly  disappears.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

chapter   45 

The  lament  of  the  brahmins  who  follow  Shri  Rama 

The  people  of  the  capital,  deeply  devoted  to  Shri  Rama,  the 
Upholder  of  Truth,  followed  him  on  his  way  to  the  forest. 
Though  King  Dasaratha,  on  the  advice  of  his  ministers,  turned 
back,  the  citizens  of  Ayodhya  continued  to  run  beside  the  chariot 
of  Rama.  The  inhabitants  of  the  city  were  devoted  to  Rama 
whose  virtues  rendered  him  resplendent  like  the  full  moon,  and 
weeping  piteously,  implored  the  holy  prince  to  return,  but  Rama, 
determined  to  prove  his  father  to  be  true  to  his  word,  pressed  on 
towards  the  forest.  They,  looking  on  Rama  as  a  thirsty  man 
looks  on  water,  were  addressed  by  him  with  tender  affection 
as  a  father  addresses  his  children. 

He  said :  "  O  Ye  People  of  Ayodhya,  for  my  sake  bestow 
the  love  and  honour  shown  to  me,  in  even  greater  measure, 
on  Bharata  !  Prince  Bharata,  who  is  of  an  excellent  disposition, 
will  assuredly  deal  benevolently  with  you  and  endear  himself 
to  you.  Though  young,  he  is  wise,  gentle  and  endowed  with 
great  courage.  Warm-hearted  and  charitable,  you  will  have  no 
cause  for  fear  on  his  accession  to  the  throne.  King  Dasaratha 
has  appointed  him  heir-apparent  in  consideration  of  his  great 
virtue,  we  should  therefore  obey  the  king.  When  I  am  absent 
in  the  forest,  you  should  so  act  towards  him  as  to  occasion  him 
no  distress.  Do  you,  desirous  of  pleasing  me,  obey  the 
king." 

Rama,  instructing  the  people  to  obey  the  king  again  and  again 
only  increased  their  desire  to  see  him  as  their  sovereign.  It 
appeared  that  Rama  with  Lakshmana  drew  the  distressed  and 
weeping  inhabitants  of  the  city  after  them  as  if  bound  by  a 
cord. 

Among  the  elders  in  age,  wisdom  and  austerity,  the  first, 
their  heads  trembling  with  advanced  years,  calling  from  a 
distance,  said :  "O  Ye  Swift  and  Excellent  Steeds,  return, 
return,  do  not  proceed  further  and  favour  Rama.  All  beings 
are  endowed  with  perception,  but  you  excel  in  the  sense  of 
hearing,  therefore  hear  our  entreaty  and  turn  back.  We  know 
258 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

the  heart  of  our  master  to  be  simple  and  gentle,  we  know  him 
to  be  a  hero  firm  in  his  vows,  therefore,  return  to  Ayodhya, 
do  not  carry  Rama  away  from  the  city  to  the  forest." 

Hearing  the  lament  of  the  aged  brahmins  and  perceiving  their 
distress,  Shri  Rama,  causing  the  chariot  to  halt,  dismounted. 
With  Lakshmana  and  Sita,  he  walked  towards  the  forest, 
followed  by  the  multitude,  proceeding  slowly  on  foot.  The  ever 
virtuous  and  compassionate  Rama  was  unable  to  endure  the 
sight  of  the  aged  brahmins  walking  on  foot,  far  behind  the 
chariot. 

The  brahmins  seeing  Rama  did  not  return,  despite  their 
supplications,  but  still  proceeded  towards  the  forest,  were 
troubled  and  overcome  with  distress,  cried  :  "  O  Rama,  thou 
art  a  friend  of  the  brahmins  and  the  whole  caste  is  following 
thee  with  the  sacred  fire  borne  on  their  shoulders.  See,  we  are 
carrying  the  holy  canopies,  like  autumn  clouds,  obtained  by  us 
by  observing  the  Vaja-peya1  ceremony.  By  covering  thee  with 
their  shade,  we  will  protect  thee  from  the  rays  of  the  sun.  O 
Child,  formerly  thy  mind  was  set  on  the  study  of  the  Veda, 
but  now  thou  art  determined  to  enter  the  forest.  Our  only 
wealth,  the  Veda,  we  have  stored  in  our  memory  and  our 
consorts  are  at  home,  protected  by  their  conjugal  devotion. 
There  is  no  cause  for  further  reflection,  we  are  determined  to  go 
with  thee !  If  thou  dost  not  walk  in  the  path  of  dharma, 
who  will  follow  it  ?* 

"  O  Rama,  what  more  can  be  said  ?  We,  whose  heads  are 
white  like  swan's  down,  offer  humble  salutations  to  thee. 
Among  us,  some  have  entered  upon  their  sacrifices,  O  Rama, 
their  completion  depends  on  thee.  Not  we  alone,  but  beasts, 
birds  and  trees,  entreat  thee  to  return ;  have  pity  on  all  these. 
Trees  desiring  to  follow  thee,  prevented  by  their  roots  which 
penetrate  deep  into  the  earth,  implore  thee  not  to  depart,  their 
branches  bending  low  in  the  wind.  See  the  birds,  forgetting 
to  seek  their  food,  sit  motionless  on  the  trees,  supplicating  thee 
who  art  compassionate  to  all." 

Thus  lamenting,  the  brahmins  beheld  the  river  Taxnasa  as  if 
obstructing  the  path  of  Rama,  preventing  his  further  progress.

Then  Sumantra,  loosing  the  tired  horses,  let  them  roll  on 
the  ground  to  relieve  their  fatigue  and  gave  them  to  drink 
causing  them  to  bathe  in  the  river,  and  allowing  them  to  graze 
on  the  banks  of  the  Tamasa. 


chapter   46 

Shri  Rama,  with  Sita  and  Lakskmana  and  the  charioteer 
drive  on  alone  to  the  forest 

Shri  Rama,  reaching  the  beautiful  banks  of  the  river  Tamasa, 
gazing  on  Sita,  addressed  his  brother  Lakshmana :  "  O  Son 
of  Queen  Sumitra,  this  is  the  first  night  of  our  exile,  there  is 
no  cause  for  anxiety.  The  forest  looks  deserted  and  melancholy, 
the  birds  and  beasts  having  retired  to  rest.  Doubtless  the 
capital  of  Ayodhya  with  its  inhabitants  and  my  royal  sire  are 
deeply  distressed  on  account  of  our  departure.  The  king,  seeing 
in  us  many  virtues,  looks  on  us  with  deep  affection.  O 
Lakshmana,  I  fear  lest  my  father  and  my  illustrious  mother 
become  blind  with  incessant  weeping.  Yet  Prince  Bharata  of 
upright  conduct,  will  assuredly  oner  consolation  to  my  parents 
in  dutiful  and  pious  words.  O  Mighty-armed  Prince,  reflecting 
on  the  compassion  of  Prince  Bharata,  I  have  no  fear  for  my 
parents.  O  Hero,  thou  hast  done  well  in  accompanying  me 
to  the  forest,  had  it  not  been  so,  my  solicitude  for  Sita  would 
have  been  great.  O  Lakshmana,  there  is  an  abundance  of  roots, 
fruits  and  berries  here,  but  to-night  I  desire  to  partake  of  water 
alone." 

Having  thus  addressed  Prince  Lakshmana,  Shri  Rama  said 
to  Sumantra :  "  O  Gentle  Friend,  attend  to  the  horses  with 
great  care."  The  sun  having  set  below  the  horizon,  Sumantra, 
fastening  the  horses  to  a  tree,  placed  tender  grass  before  them, 
heedful  of  their  welfare.  The  time  of  Sandhya1  having  come, 
the  charioteer  observed  his  devotions  according  to  the  rules  of 
his  caste,  then,  with  the  help  of  Lakshmana,  prepared  a  bed 

1  Sandhya — Evening  devotion*. 

260 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

for  Rama.  Perceiving  the  bed  made  with  tender  leaves,  on  the 
banks  of  the  Tamasa,  Shri  Rama  with  Sita  and  Lakshmana 
rested  there. 

Finding  Shri  Rama  and  Sita  sleeping,  Lakshmana,  leaving 
his  seat,  recounted  the  excellent  virtues  of  Rama  to  the 
charioteer.  Lakshmana  thus  passed  the  whole  night  till  the 
sun  rose,  conversing  with  Sumantra  on  the  attributes  of  Rama. 

In  this  manner,  on  the  banks  of  the  Tamasa,  among  herds 
of  cattle,  Shri  Rama  and  those  who  had  followed  him,  passed 
the  night.  At  dawn,  Shri  Rama  rose  and  seeing  the  people 
still  asleep,  said  to  his  virtuous  brother  Lakshmana : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  see  how  these  people,  abandoning  their 
homes  and  property,  to  follow  uss  are  sleeping  under  the  trees. 
It  seems  that  they,  vowing  to  bring  us  back,  will  give  up  their 
lives  rather  than  be  false  to  their  determination.  Let  us, 
therefore,  O  Brother,  leave  this  place  before  they  wake.  When 
we  have  crossed  the  Tamasa,  there  will  be  no  further  cause 
for  anxiety.  By  our  silent  departure,  the  people  of  the  capital 
of  King  Ikshwaku,  will  not,  like  us,  be  compelled  to  sleep 
under  the  trees.  It  is  the  duty  of  a  prince  to  preserve  them 
from  suffering  and  not  make  them  the  companions  of  his 


Shri  Lakshmana  answered  Ramachandra,  saying  :  "  O  Wise 
One,  I  accept  thy  resolve,  let  us  mount  the  chariot  immediately." 

Rama  then  said  to  Sumantra :  "  Speedily  prepare  the  chariot, 
I  will  proceed  towards  the  forest,  let  us  therefore  depart  from 
hence  without  delay." 

The  charioteer,  hastily  yoking  the  horses  to  the  chariot, 
humbly  addressed  Rama,  saying :  "  O  Great  Prince,  the  chariot 
is  now  ready,  please  ascend  with  Lakshmana  and  Sita ;  may 
prosperity  attend  thee." 

Shri  Rama  with  his  bow,  quiver  and  other  weapons,  mounted 
the  chariot  and  passed  over  the  swiftly  flowing  river.  Crossing 
the  Tamasa,  at  a  short  distance  from  the  shore,  they  traversed 
a  rugged  path  overgrown  with  briars,  and  then  came  to  a  wide 
road,  where  they  could  travel  with  ease  and  which  was  safe  from 
any  danger.  To  elude  the  citizens,  Shri  Rama  said  to  Sumantra: 
"O  Charioteer,  drive  first  towards  the  south.  Having  thus 
261 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

driven  for  a  space,  return  again,  so  that  no  trace  of  us  may  be 
found." 

Shri  Sumantra,  following  the  instructions  of  Rama,  drove 
forward,  then  returning,  stood  before  Rama.  The  son  of 
Dasaratha,  the  augmcntcr  of  the  glory  of  the  house  of  Raghu, 
spoke  from  the  chariot,  saying :   "  NowdrivetowardsTapovana." 

Sumantra,  turning  the  chariot  towards  the  north,  proceeded 
in  the  direction  of  the  forest. 


chapter  47 

Those  who  have  followed  Prince  Rama  find  themselves  alone 

The  night  being  over  and  the  day  having  dawned,  the  citizens 
awoke  and  not  beholding  Rama,  were  overwhelmed  with  grief, 
not  knowing  how  to  act.  Seeking  here  and  there,  their  eyes 
bathed  in  tears,  they  were  unable  to  discover  by  what  path 
Shri  Rama  had  departed.  Wretched  and  pale  with  distress, 
with  quivering  hearts  and  utterly  dispirited,  they  broke  into 
piteous  exclamations,  saying : — 

"Cursed  be  the  sleep  that  veiled  our  perceptions,  now 
we  shall  not  behold  the  full  chested  and  large-eyed  Rama. 
How  fruitless  is  our  devotion,  since  Rama  has  gone  to  the  forest 
leaving  us,  his  faithful  friends,  here.  Why  has  Rama  who  ever 
treated  us  as  his  children,  left  us  to  enter  the  forest  ?  Either  we 
will  find  death  here  or  go  to  the  Himalayas  and  perish  in  the 
snow.  What  avails  life  without  Rama  ?  Here  is  dried  wood, 
let  us  collect  it  and  kindling  a  fire,  perish  in  the  flames.  What 
shall  we  say  on  our  return?  Shall  we  tell  others  we  have 
abandoned  the  mighty  armed  Rama,  who  is  free  from  envy 
and  a  votary  of  truth  ?  Alas  !  we  cannot  do  so.  The  wretched 
city  with  the  women,  the  aged  and  the  children,  seeing  us  return 
without  Rama,  will  be  plunged  in  grief.  Having  abandoned 
our  homes  to  follow  that  self-controlled  prince,  how  can  we 
venture  to  face  the  people  without  him  ?  " 
262 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

Thus  lamenting,  with  uplifted  aims,  filled  with  distress,  they 
resembled  cows  bereft  of  their  young. ,  Following  the  track  of 
the  chariot  wheels,  they  pressed  forward,  till,  losing  their  trace, 
they  became  prostrate  with  grief.  Finding  no  further  path  to 
follow,  they  turned  back  crying :  "Alas  !  what  shall  we  do  ? 
Fate  is  against  us ! "  Then,  by  the  way  by  which  they  had 
come,  they  retraced  their  steps  to  Ayodhya. 

Shri  Rama,  failing  to  return,  the  people  became  restless,  and 
seeing  the  capital  cheerless,  despondent  and  sorrow-stricken, 
they  wept,  murmuring  to  each  other :  "  The  city,  bereft  of 
Rama,  has  no  beauty,  it  resembles  a  dried-up  river,  divested 
of  its  snakes  by  an  eagle."  As  the  sky  without  the  moon  or 
the  sea  without  water,  so  did  the  city  appear  to  the  people, 
causing  their  hearts  to  faint  within  them. 

Sadly  entering  their  magnificent  dwellings,  afflicted  and 
distraught,  they  were  unable  to  distinguish  one  of  their  own 
relatives  from  a  stranger. 


CHAPTER    48 

Ayodhya  without  Shri  Ramackandra  is  bereft  of  beauty 

Thus  afflicted,  the  people  of  the  capital,  their  eyes  streaming 
with  tears,  longed  to  give  up  their  lives.  Having  followed  Rama 
to  the  forest,  they  became  melancholy  and  appeared  to  be  almost 
lifeless.  In  their  homes,  with  their  wives  and  sons,  they 
lamented  bitterly.  None  rejoiced,  none  were  cheerful,  none 
decked  out  their  children  to  advantage,  nor  did  the  women 
adorn  themselves ;  no  fire  burnt  on  the  hearth  of  any  home, 
none  was  glad  to  recover  the  wealth  he  had  lost  and  none 
rejoiced  at  a  sudden  increase  of  riches.  Mothers  found  no 
delight  in  the  return  of  their  first-born  after  a  long  absence. 
Every  house  was  filled  with  wailing ;  the  husbands  returning 
without  Rama  were  upbraided  by  their  wives  with  bitter  words, 
aa  an  elephant  is  goaded  by  its  driver.  Everywhere  was  heard : 
"  Without  beholding  Ramachandra,  of  what  use  to  us  are  our 
*63 


7HE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

homes,  women,  wealth,  sons  or  pleasure  ?  There  is  only  one 
who  is  truly  virtuous  and  it  is  Lakshmana,  who  has  followed 
Rama  and  Sita  to  the  forest !  How  fortunate  are  those  lakes 
and  rivers  filled  with  lotuses,  whose  waters,  Rama,  entering  to 
bathe,  doth  purify  !  Beautiful  forests,  rivers  with  verdant  banks, 
lakes  and  mountains  will  be  adorned  by  the  presence  of  Shri 
Ramachandra.  Those  mountains  visited  by  Rama,  recognizing 
their  beloved  guest,  will  honour  him  with  due  hospitality. 

"  The  trees  also,  their  branches  laden  with  flowers  and  buds, 
in  which  the  bees  are  humming  and  murmuring,  will  offer  their 
beauty  to  Rama.  The  hills  will  send  forth  flowers  out  of  season 
and  yield  fruit  and  blossom  in  his  honour.  The  crystal  waterfalls 
of  varied  beauty  will  gush  forth  from  the  mountains  to  give 
delight  to  him.  The  trees,  growing  on  the  slope  of  the 
mountains,  will  enchant  him.  Where  Rama  is,  fear  and  danger 
are  banished.  The  heroic  sons  of  King  Dasaratha,  even  now, 
are  but  a  little  distance  from  us ;  come  let  us  follow  them. 
There  is  no  happiness  save  in  the  service  of  the  holy  Feet 
of  that  illumined  One.  Verily  he  is  the  only  Lord  of  the  world, 
the  Absolute,  the  Highest  State  and  our  sole  support." 

The  women  of  the  city,  overcome  with  grief,  addressing  their 
husbands  said :  "  Let  us  follow  Rama,  we  will  serve  Shri  Sita, 
you  attend  on  Shri  Rama.  Remember,  Rama  will  preserve  and 
maintain  you  in  the  forest,  while  Shri  Sita  will  grant  support 
to  us.  Of  what  use  is  life  where  the  heart  is  restless  and  the 
mind  bereft  of  purpose  ?  If  Kaikeyi  rule  the  kingdom  setting 
aside  the  moral  law,  what  delight  can  we  have  in  children  and 
possessions;  even  our  lives  will  become  valueless.  Will  Kaikeyi 
be  solicitous  on  our  account,  she,  who  has  abandoned  King 
Dasaratha  and  her  son  Shri  Ramachandra,  for  the  sake  of  power? 
We  swear  by  our  sons  that  while  we  live,  we  will  never  be  slaves 
to  Kaikeyi.  Who  can  live  happily  under  the  rule  of  that 
shameless  and  evil  woman  who  pitilessly  exiled  the  son  of  the 
king  ?  Without  a  ruler  the  defenceless  kingdom  will  become 
a  prey  to  every  misfortune  and  perish  on  account  of  Kaikeyi's 
evil  deeds.  The  king  will  not  long  survive  the  exile  of  Rama 
and  without  him  the  kingdom  will  be  destroyed.  Our  good 
karma  being  exhausted  we  are  miserable ;  let  us  either  have 
recourse  to  poison,  or  follow  Rama,  or  seek  some  other  place  and 
264 


AYODHYA  KANDA 
live  there  unknown.  By  exiling  Rama,  Sita  and  Lakshmana, 
through  false  means  we  have  been  made  subject  to  Bharata's 
governance  as  beasts  are  lead  to  the  slaughter.  Shri  Rama, 
a  source  of  delight  resembling  the  full  moon,  the  destroyer  of 
his  foes,  mighty-armed,  Lakshmana's  elder  brother,  whose  eyes 
are  like  lotuses,  who  speaks  in  gentle  accents,  who  is  brave, 
guileless  and  beloved  of  the  people,  will  assuredly  adorn  the 
forest  wheresoever  he  roams." 

The  women  of  the  city  distressed  by  their  separation  from  Rama, 
wept  and  mourned  as  do  the  friends  of  a  dying  man.  Lamenting 
thus,  the  sun  set  and  the  night  fell,  no  sacrificial  fires  were 
visible,  nor  did  the  brahmins,  devoted  to  the  study  of  the  Veda, 
intone  the  sacred  texts,  or  recite  the  Furanas,  and  in  no  dwelling 
was  any  lamp  kindled.  The  city  of  Ayodhya,  stricken  and 
destitute,  the  stalls  of  merchandise  forsaken,  was  bereft  of  beauty 
like  the  sky  divested  of  stars.  The  women  of  Ayodhya,  filled 
with  sorrow  as  if  their  own  sons  or  brothers  had  been  banished, 
wept  bitterly,  Shri  Ramachandra  being  dearer  to  them  than 
their  own  children.  In  the  city,  no  songs  or  music  was  heard, 
nor  was  there  dancing  or  any  sign  of  rejoicing.  The  merchant 
ceased  to  expose  their  merchandise  and  sat  sunk  in  dejection. 
Thus  Ayodhya,  without  joy  or  activity,  appeared  as  desolate 
as  an  ocean  without  water. 


CHAPTER    49

Shri  Rama,  remembering  his  father's  command,  had  travelled 
far  through  the  night.  Day  dawned  while  he  was  still  journey- 
ing ;  offering  up  his  morning  prayer,  he  continued  on  his  way, 
soon  reaching  the  southern  boundary  of  Koshala. 

Enjoying  the  cultivated  fields,  the  forests,  and  trees  laden 

with  blossom,  he  drove  on,  drawn  by  swift  horses.    As  he 

passed,  he  heard  the  people  of  the  villages  and  hamlets  conversing 

thus :  "  Woe  unto  King  Dasaratha  enslaved  by  concupiscence.

disposition  ;  violating  the  ancient  tradition,  she  has  performed 
this  evil  deed,  she  who  has  banished  the  Prince  of  Light,  who 
is  erudite,  compassionate  and  self-controlled.  How  will  the 
daughter  of  King  Janaka,  brought  up  in  ease,  endure  the 
hardships  of  the  forest  ?  Alas  !  The  king  has  no  love  for  his 
son  or  he  would  not  have  abandoned  one  so  perfect,  who  is 
devoted  to  the  welfare  of  all." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  villagers,  Shri  Rama  pressed  on 
quickly  and  crossed  the  boundary  of  Koshala.  Then  fording 
the  river  Vedasruti,  8  pure  stream,  he  proceeded  south.  After 
traversing  a  great  distance,  he  came  to  the  cool  waters  of  the 
Gaumati  flowing  towards  the  sea,  with  many  cows  grazing  on 
its  banks.  The  swift  steeds,  restrained  by  Rama,  crossed  this 
river  and  then  the  Syandika,  on  whose  banks  peacocks  and  ducks 
were  heard.  Rama  here  showed  Sita  the  land  formerly  given 
by  Manu  to  Ikshwaku,  a  spacious  and  open  country  of  many 
principalities.  Then  Shri  Rama,  whose  voice  resembled  an 
enchanted  swan,  addressed  Sumantra,  saying :  "  O  Charioteer, 
when  will  the  day  come,  when  I,  returning  from  the  forest  in 
company  with  my  parents,  will  sport  in  the  flowering  woods 
of  Sarayu  ?  To  hunt  in  the  forest  is  the  prerogative  of  royal 
sages.  It  is  the  favourite  pursuit  of  kings  and  others  also  incline 
to  it.  I  do  not  deem  it  evil  and  desire  to  engage  in  it  when 
the  season  of  my  austerities  is  over.*' 

Thus  firm  in  his  purpose,  Shri  Ramachandra  continued  to 
converse  sweetly  with  Sumantra. 


CHAPTER     50 

They  reach  the  river  Gunga  and  meet  the  chief  of  ferrymen, 
Guha 

Having  crossed  the  boundary  of  Koshala,  Rama,  turning  his  race 

towards  Ayodhya,  with  joined  palms,  addressed  the  city: 

266 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

"  O  Ayodhya,  Chief  of  Cities,  protected  by  the  kings  of  the 
House  of  Ikshwaku,  I  take  leave  of  thee  and  of  the  gods  thy 
protectors  who  dwell  with  thee.  Having  fulfilled  the  command 
of  the  king,  I  shall,  returning  from  the  forest,  again  behold  thee 
and  my  parents." 

Then  lifting  up  his  arms,  Shri  Rama,  the  tears  tailing 
from  his  eyes,  addressed  the  citizens  of  his  father's  kingdom : 
"O  Ye  Who  have  treated  me  with  the  respect  and  affection 
due  to  a  master,  it  is  not  meet  that  you  remain  with  me, 
now  return  to  your  homes  and  discharge  the  duties  of  your 
households." 

Bowing  down  to  Shri  Rama,  the  people  circumambulated  him 
with  reverence  and  turned  homewards,  frequently  halting, 
weeping  and  lamenting.  Shri  Rama,  seeing  them  weeping 
and  not  yet  satisfied  with  beholding  him,  told  the  charioteer 
to  drive  on  speedily  and  passed  beyond  their  sight  as  the  sun 
sinks  out  of  view  at  the  time  of  evening. 

Proceeding  on  his  way,  Shri  Rama  beheld  prosperous  towns 
and  villages  full  of  men  of  charitable,  righteous  and  fearless 
disposition  evidenced  by  the  abundance  of  temples  and  sacrificial 
pillars  of  their  cities.  The  gardens  filled  with  mango  trees  were 
enriched  by  pools  of  translucent  water  with  carefully  tended 
highways  and  herds  of  cattle  grazing  here  and  there.  Everywhere 
the  recitation  of  the  Veda  could  be  heard.  From  his  chariot, 
Shri  Rama  surveyed  the  Kingdom  of  Koshala  and  passed  beyond 
its  confines.  The  sagacious  Rama,  proceeding  through  the 
extensive  land  inhabited  by  happy  and  prosperous  people, 
enriched  by  pleasant  gardens,  came  to  the  southern  boundary 
of  Koshala  and  beheld  the  holy  Gunga,  adorned  by  the  presence 
of  tne  sages,  with  its  cool  waters  flowing  in  three  directions. 
Near  the  bank  of  the  sacred  river,  he  saw  the  beautiful 
hermitages,  frequented  by  holy  men  and  pools  of  limpid  water 
visited  by  celestial  nymphs  at  play.  The  holy  Ganges,  honoured 
by  deities,  titans,  celestial  musicians  and  naiads,  that  sacred 
current,  displaying  innumerable  charming  vistas,  embellished 
by  the  gardens  of  the  gods,  and  which  in  heaven  is  named 
the  "  Stream  of  Golden  Lotuses  ",  that  holy  river,  the  sound 
of  whose  clashing  waves  resembles  deep  laughter,  which  moving 
rapidly,  covered  with  foam  white  as  snow,  flows  merrily  forwards

and  falling  from  the  heights  on  the  rocks  below,  resembles  a 
maiden's  plaited  locks  ;  sometimes  made  beautiful  by  whirlpools, 
here  dark  and  deep,  there  with  the  roar  of  waters,  proclaiming 
the  presence  of  Shri  Gunga  herself ;  those  sacred  waters  wherein 
the  celestial  beings  plunge  and  swim,  where  white  lotuses  float, 
bordered  by  high  banks  or  shelving  sands  ;  there,  where  swans, 
cranes,  and  chakur  birds  are  heard,  where  trees  adorn  the  banks 
and  waterlilies  float  or  fields  of  lotus  flowers  whose  buds  re- 
veal their  tender  beauty  carpet  the  tide.  Sometimes  the  waters, 
reddened  by  the  petals  of  lotuses,  make  the  river  appear  like 
a  lovely  woman  attired  in  a  crimson  sari ;  those  sparkling  waters, 
green  as  emerald,  where  mighty  tuskers  sport  and  also  the  great 
guardian  elephants  of  the  earth's  four  quarters,  or  those  bearing 
the  gods,  where  the  sound  of  Hara  !  Hara  !  resounds  forever. 
Shri  Gunga,  beautiful  as  a  woman,  tastefully  adorned  with 
brilliant  gems ;  Shri  Gunga,  enriched  with  fruit,  flowers  and 
birds  of  every  hue,  abounding  in  porpoises,  crocodiles  and 
serpents ;  that  sacred  stream,  falling  from  the  feet  of  the  Blessed 
Vishnu,  divine  and  spotless,  the  destroyer  of  others1  sin,  having 
sported  in  the  locks  of  Shri  Shiva,  thereafter  descending  on 
earth,  through  the  power  of  the  penance  of  Bhagiratha. 

Shri  Rama,  proceeding  towards  the  city  of  Shringavera,  seeing 
the  queen  of  the  ocean,  the  holy  Gunga,  where  the  songs  of 
the  krauncha  bird  are  heard,  watching  wave  on  wave  rising  on 
the  sacred  stream,  that  mighty  warrior,  Rama,  said  to  Sumantra  : 
"  O  Charioteer,  let  us  lodge  here.  There,  under  the  Ingudi 
tree,1  laden  with  verdant  leaves  and  blossom,  let  us  rest.  O 
Benevolent  One,  let  us  linger  by  the  mighty  river,  whose 
auspicious  waters  are  worshipped  by  the  gods,  the  danavas, 
serpents,  beasts  and  birds,  and  let  us  offer  homage  there." 

Sumantra  and  Lakshmana  answering  "  Be  it  so ",  stayed 
the  chariot  under  the  Ingudi  tree. 

Arriving  there,  Shri  Rama  and  Lakshmana  descended  from 
the  chariot  and  Sumantra,  unyoking  the  horses,  respectfully 
seated  himself  facing  Rama,  at  the  foot  of  the  tree. 

The  king  of  that  country  was  one,  Guha,  dear  to  Rama  as 
his  own  life,  by  caste  a  ferryman,  but  possessing  an  army  and 
designated  "  King  of  Watermen  ".    Hearing  that  that  lion

AYODHYA  KANDA 
among  men,  Shri  Rama,  had  come  to  bis  territory,  he  to- 
gether with  his  aged  minister  and  relatives  went  forth  to  meet 
the  prince.  Shri  Rama,  seeing  the  chief  of  ferrymen,  from  a 
distance,  went  with  Lakshmana  to  meet  and  welcome  him. 
Perceiving  Shri  Rama  to  be  in  ascetic's  garb,  Guha,  distressed, 
bowing  before  him,  said :  "  O  Prince,  let  this  small  kingdom 
be  as  Ayodhya  to  thee,  please  issue  thy  commands,  I  am  at 
thy  service.  O  Mighty-armed  One,  it  is  rare  to  receive  a  guest 
so  deeply  beloved !  " 

Guha  then  brought  excellent  dishes  of  delicious  foods, 
together  with  the  arghya  and  said  :  "  We  are  thy  servants  and 
thou  art  our  lord,  accept  this  kingdom  and  rule  it  as  thine  own. 
Here  are  dishes  of  various  kinds,  desserts,  liquids,  spices, 
excellent  beds  on  which  to  rest  and  provender  for  the  horses, 
all  at  thy  disposal." 

Shri  Rama  answered :  "  0  Guha,  thou  hast  come  to  welcome 
me  on  foot  out  of  affection,  by  this  I  am  duly  honoured,  I  am 
pleased  with  thee."  Then  taking  him  in  his  strong  arms  and 
embracing  him,  Shri  Rama  addressed  him  in  cheerful  accents, 
saying  :  "  O  Guha,  through  my  good  fortune  I  behold  thee  and 
thy  friends  in  good  health.  Is  all  well  among  thy  people  and 
with  thy  possessions  ?  O  Friend,  having  renounced  the  accept- 
ance of  gifts,  I  am  not  able  to  partake  of  what  thou  hast  offered 
me  with  love ;  know  that  having  assumed  the  robe  of  kusha  grass 
and  the  antelope  skin,  I  live  on  fruit  and  roots  ;  X  am  the  pro- 
tector of  dharma  and  my  father's  servant.  Being  an  ascetic,  I 
may  only  accept  a  little  grass  for  the  horses  and  nothing  beside — 
by  this  alone,  I  am  fully  welcomed.  These  horses  of  my  father 
Dasaratha  are  dear  to  him,  they  having  received  oats,  grass  and 
pure  water,  I  am  honoured  in  full  measure." 

On  this,  Guha  commanded  his  servants  to  provide  drink  and 
provender  for  the  horses.  Then  Rama  assuming  a  dress  of  bark 
performed  his  evening  devotions,  drinking  the  water  brought 
by  Shri  Lakshmana.  Then  Lakshmana  washed  the  feet  of  Rama 
and  Sita  who  had  laid  themselves  down  beneath  the  Ingudi  tree 
and  seated  himself  respectfully  near  them.  Guha  with  Sumantra 
seated  near  Shri  Lakshmana  who,  armed  with  bow  and  arrow, 
carefully  guarded  Rama,  spent  the  night  in  holy  converse. 
Rama,  the  wise  and  illustrious  son  of  King  Dasaratha,  deserving 
269 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

every  comfort  and  who  now,  lying  on  the  ground,  suffered 
adversity,  passed  the  night  undisturbed  in  deep  sleep. 


chapter  5  x 

The  night  is  spent  on  the  bank  of  the  sacred  river 

Guha  addressed  Shri  Lakshmana  who  was  humbly  guarding 
his  royal  brother,  and  said :  "  0  Friend,  rest  at  ease  on  this 
soft  bed  prepared  for  thee.  We  are  fitted  for  the  forest  life, 
but  thou  accustomed  to  ease,  rest  now,  we  will  watch  during 
the  night  and  guard  Shri  Rama  from  harm,  none  is  dearer  to  me 
on  earth,  I  swear  to  thee  in  truth.  To  gratify  Shri  Rama,  I 
will  acquire  fame,  righteousness,  wealth  and  pleasure.1  I,  with 
my  bow  and  arrow,  attended  by  my  kindred,  will  watch  over 
Shri  Rama,  now  asleep  with  Sita.  Wandering  daily  in  the  forest, 
nothing  there  is  unknown  to  me,  even  if  a  powerful  enemy 
attacked  me  in  the  forest,  I  could  withstand  him." 

Lakshmana  answered :  "  I  have  full  faith  in  the  power  of 
thy  protection,  nor  do  I  fear  any,  but  how,  forgetful  of  dharma, 
can  I  refrain  from  watching  over  Shri  Rama  ?  Beholding  the 
chief  heir  of  Dasaratha,  sovereign  of  the  earth,  lying  on  the 
ground  with  the  daughter  of  King  Janaka,  how  should  I  dare 
to  rest  while  he  is  sleeping  ?  " 

See  Nishada2 !  That  Mighty  Prince,  Shri  Rama,  whom  none 
dared  challenge,  sleeps  on  a  bed  of  straw.  That  Great  One 
obtained  by  King  Dasaratha  by  the  merit  of  charity,  austerity 
and  devotion,  having  become  an  ascetic,  his  aged  sire  will  not 
long  survive  and  then  will  the  earth  become  a  widow.  O 
Nishada,  I  deem  the  women  wailing  and  lamenting  at  our 
departure  have  become  silent  and  the  royal  palace  also,  but 
I  fear  the  king,  Kaushalya  and  my  mother,  will  not  outlast 
this  night.  Consoled  by  Shatrughna,  my  mother  may  endure 
a  little  while,  but  Queen  Kaushalya,  the  mother  of  this  hero, 

1  The  four  legitimate  aim§  in  life. 

1  The  Nishada  is  the  mountain  tribe  to  which  Guha  belonged. 


AYODHYA  KANDA 
will  surely  yield  up  her  life  without  Rama.  Alas  !  Ayodhya, 
the  repository  of  wealth  and  inhabited  by  those  who  love  Rama, 
will  perish  through  the  distress  caused  by  the  king's  death. 
How  can  the  king  live  without  beholding  his  beloved  and 
virtuous  eldest  son?  Queen  Kaushalya  also  will  perish,  nor 
can  my  mother  long  survive  Kaushalya's  death.  Alas  !  The 
whole  structure  of  the  king's  purpose  has  fallen  in  ruins;  desiring 
to  appoint  Rama  as  his  regent,  he  will  leave  this  world  still 
cherishing  this  hope.  He  is  fortunate  who,  attending  the  last 
hours  of  the  king,  performs  his  obsequies — and  then  ranges 
the  city  full  of  charming  courts,  palaces  and  temples  with 
intersecting  streets  where  lovely  courtesans  are  seen  ;  that  city 
abounding  in  splendid  chariots,  horses  and  elephants,  resounding 
with  trumpets,  possessing  every  amenity,  filled  with  happy 
people,  enriched  by  parks  and  gardens  where  conferences  and 
joyous  gatherings  are  held  daily.  When  shall  we,  returning 
from  the  forest,  walk  in  the  royal  city  ?  May  King  Dasaratba 
continue  to  live,  so  that  we  may  behold  that  excellent  monarch 
on  our  return,  with  Shri  Rama  the  Upholder  of  Truth." 

Thus  lamenting  and  afflicted,  Shri  Lakshmana,  keeping  watch 
over  Rama,  passed  the  night.  Prince  Lakshmana  uttering  words 
of  truth  and  affection  concerning  his  parents  and  elders, 
spoke  thus  to  Guha  who,  grieving  and  disquieted,  wept  like 
an  elephant  in  pain. 


CHAPTER   52 

Sumantra  is  ordered  to  return  ;  Shri  Rama,  Sita 
and  Lakshmana  cross  the  holy  river 

The  day  having  dawned,  the  broad-chested  and  illustrious  Rama 
addressed  the  virtuous  Prince  Lakshmana.  "  Lo  !  the  goddess 
Night  has  fled  and  the  sun  is  about  to  rise.  O  listen  how  the 
blackbird  is  singing  and  the  peacock's  cry  is  heard  in  the  forest. 
Let  us  cross  the  swift-flowing  Bhagirathi,  which  runs  towards 
the  sea." 

27X  T 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Shri  Lakshmana,  hearing  Shri  Rama's  command,  standing 
before  his  brother,  called  Guha  and  Sumantra.  Guha  divining 
Shri  Rama's  purpose,  summoned  his  ministers  and  said  to  them : 
"  Speedily  bring  a  good  boat,  stout  and  strong,  capable  of  taking 
Shri  Rama  across." 

The  minister  according  to  Guha's  instruction  brought  an 
excellent  boat  and  said :  "  Sir,  the  boat  is  ready."  Then  Guha, 
with  joined  palms,  approaching  Shri  Rama  thus  addressed  him : 
"  O  Lord,  thy  boat  is  at  hand,  what  further  dost  thou  require 
of  me  ?  O  Lion  among  men,  O  Prince,  O  Thou  observer  of 
great  vows,  the  boat  capable  of  crossing  the  river  flowing  towards 
the  sea,  is  here,  please  enter  it." 

The  glorious  Prince  Rama  answered  Guha  saying :  "  Thou 
hast  supplied  me  with  all  I  could  desire,  now  place  the  baggage 
on  the  boat."  The  princes  donning  their  quivers,  and  bearing 
their  bows,  came  to  the  place  where  the  boat  was  waiting. 

Then  Sumantra  approaching  the  righteous  Rama  with  bowed 
head  and  joined  palms,  said :  "  What  commands  hast  thou  for 
me,  O  Lord?"  Touching  Sumantra  with  his  right  hand, 
Shri  Rama  replied:  "O  Virtuous  Sumantra,  now  return  to 
the  king  and  serve  him  with  vigilance,  I  no  longer  need  thee. 
O  Friend,  leaving  the  chariot,  I  will  enter  the  forest  on  foot." 
Sumantra  receiving  the  order  to  return,  imagined  himself 
already  separated  from  Rama  and  full  of  grief  exclaimed  :  "  O 
Lord,  none  in  the  kingdom  desires  thee  to  enter  the  forest  with 
Sita  and  Lakshmana  like  a  common  man.  When  I  behold  thee, 
compassionate  and  guileless,  facing  great  adversity,  I  regard  as 
vain,  compassion,  simplicity,  the  brahmacharya  vow  and  the 
study  of  the  Veda !  O  Prince,  dwelling  in  the  forest  with  Sita 
and  Lakshmana  will  bring  thee  renown  equal  to  one  who 
conquers  the  three  worlds ;  but  we,  separated  from  thee,  O 
Rama,  are  doomed  and  will  fall  under  the  sway  of  the  sinful 
Kaikeyi." 

The  wise  Sumantra,  certain  of  Rama's  departure,  filled  with 
distress,  wept  long  and  bitterly.  At  length,  restraining  his  tears 
he  purified  himself  with  water,  and  was  then  addressed  by  Rama 
who  spoke  to  him  in  gentle  accents,  saying:  "Among  the 
ministers  of  the  house  of  Ikshwaku,  none  is  so  kind  a  friend. 
Wilt  thou,  therefore,  act  in  such  wise  that  the  king  be  freed 
27a 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

from  grief?  The  Lord  of  the  earth  is  aged,  his  mind  confused 
and  he  is  tormented  with  desire,  therefore  I  ask  thee  to  minister 
unto  him.  Whatever  the  king  commands,  through  affection 
for  Queen  Kaikeyi,  do  thou  perform.  Kings  rule  to  fulfil  their 
desires.  O  Sumantra,  act  in  such  a  way  that  the  kitfg  be  not 
displeased,  and  that  he  may  not  sink  under  the  weight  of 
affliction.  When  thou  dost  approach  him,  who  was  hitherto 
a  stranger  to  suffering,  offer  salutations  on  my  behalf  and  say : 
*  Having  renounced  Ayodhya  and  entered  the  forest,  Shri  Rama, 
Lakshmana  and  Sita  suffer  no  distress ;  fourteen  years  having 
passed,  thou  shalt  soon  see  them  return !  * 

"  Deliver  thus  my  message  of  affection  again  and  again  to 
the  king,  to  my  mother  Kaushalya,  the  other  queens  and  also 
Kaikeyi.  Bowing  to  the  feet  of  my  mother  Kaushalya,  tell  hei 
that  all  is  well  with  me  and  also  with  Sita  and  Lakshmana. 
Advise  the  king  to  send  for  Bharata  speedily  and  when  he  is 
come,  let  him  be  installed  as  regent.  Taking  Prince  Bharata 
in  thine  arms,  appoint  him  king ;  thou  shalt  thus  be  freed  from 
the  grief  caused  by  this  separation.  Thereafter,  let  Bharata, 
on  my  behalf  be  instructed  to  treat  our  mothers  with  equal 
affection  and  with  the  same  honour  as  is  due  to  the  king.  Let 
him  look  on  Sumitra  and  my  mother  Kaushalya  as  his  own 
mother  Kaikeyi.  Do  thou  say :  *  If  thou  accept  the  kingdom 
to  please  the  king,  thy  fame  and  happiness  in  both  worlds 
are  assured '." 

Having  spoken  thus,  Shri  Rama  desired  to  dismiss  Sumantra 
from  his  presence  bearing  the  message,  but  the  minister,  deeply 
distressed,  addressed  him,  saying  :  "  O  Ramachandra,  forgive 
me  if  I  utter  words  lacking  in  reverence,  urged  by  my  devotion 
for  thee,  nor  deem  me  to  be  a  hypocrite.  O  Raghava,  Ayodhya, 
by  thy  departure,  resembles  one  afflicted  by  the  loss  of  a  son, 
how  shall  I  return  there  without  thee  ?  Seeing  the  chariot 
without  thee,  the  people  will  be  filled  with  distress,  the  heart 
of  the  city  will  be  riven  in  twain.  Though  thou  hast  travelled 
far,  yet  in  the  hearts  of  the  citizens  of  Ayodhya  thou  art  still 
present  with  them.  Assuredly  the  people  have  neither  partaken 
of  food  nor  water  in  thine  absence.  At  the  time  of  thy  departure, 
O  Prince,  thou  wast  acquainted  with  their  grief,  and  didst  witness 
their  weeping  and  lamentation.  On  beholding  the  empty 
273 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

chariot,  their  sorrow  will  be  increased  a  thousandfold.  On 
returning  to  Ayodhya,  with  what  words  shall  I  address  thy 
mother  ?  Shall  I  say  *  I  have  left  thy  son  at  the  home  of  thy 
brother,  do  not  grieve.'  ?  How  can  I  utter  such  a  falsehood, 
yet  how -can  I  relate  the  truth  to  her?  Those  noble  steeds 
that  have  drawn  the  chariot  bearing  thee,  Lakshmana  and  Sita, 
how  shall  they  be  driven  without  thee  ?  O  Sinless  Prince,  I 
cannot  return  to  Ayodhya  without  thee,  therefore  let  me  remain 
with  thee  in  the  forest.  If  in  spite  of  my  prayer,  thou  still 
renouncest  me,  I  will,  with  the  chariot  enter  a  blazing  fire.  O 
Prince,  whatever  beings  seek  to  frustrate  thy  life  of  devotion 
in  the  forest,  I  will  repel  with  my  chariot.  Through  thee,  I 
am  enabled  to  drive  the  chariot,  now  be  gracious  enough  to  let 
me  enter  the  forest  with  thee.  Accept  me,  therefore,  as  thy 
protector  and  let  me  enter  the  forest,  I  ask  thee  with  exceeding 
love.  O  Hero,  should  these  excellent  steeds  serve  thee  in  the 
forest,  they  will  acquire  a  high  spiritual  state.  O  Prince,  by 
whatever  means  I  may  serve  thee  in  the  forest,  I  would  esteem  it 
more  than  residence  in  heaven  or  in  Ayodhya.  Without  thee, 
I  am  unable  to  return  to  the  capital,  as  the  sinful  Indra  was 
unable  to  enter  Amaravati.  It  is  my  highest  desire  when  thy 
period  of  exile  shall  be  over  to  convey  thee  to  the  capital  once 
more.  O  Rama,  fourteen  years  with  thee  will  pass  like  a  moment, 
while  without  thee,  they  will  seem  like  a  thousand  years. 
O  Friend  of  those  devoted  to  thee,  I  have  resolved  to  stay  in 
the  forest  with  the  son  of  my  lord.  How  can'st  thou  abandon 
thy  devoted  friend,  who  only  seeks  to  do  bis  duty  ?  " 

Thus  repeatedly  besought  by  the  minister  Sumantra,  Shri 
Rama  answered  him  saying :  "  O  Lover  of  thy  Master,  I  know 
of  thy  devotion  to  me,  but  hear  the  reasons  which  prompt  me 
to  send  thee  hence  to  Ayodhya. 

"  Seeing  thee  return  to  the  capital,  my  mother  Kaikeyi, 
convinced  I  have  entered  the  forest  will  be  satisfied  and  will 
no  longer  reproach  the  king,  charging  him  with  falsehood  and 
unrighteousness.  I  desire  that  my  mother  Kaikeyi  should  enjoy 
the  prosperous  kingdom  governed  by  her  son  Bharata,  therefore, 
to  please  me,  return  to  the  capital  and  deliver  the  message  with 
which  I  have  entrusted  thee." 

Thus  Rama,  offering  explanation  to  Sumantra  then  spoke 
274 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

words  of  reason  and  encouragement  to  Guha,  saying :  "  O  Guha, 
it  is  not  propei  for  me  to  dwell  in  the  forest  in  which  my  friends 
reside,  therefore,  constructing  a  hut  of  leaves  and  twigs  elsewhere 
I  will  live  as  an  ascetic.  For  the  spiritual  welfare  of  my 
father,  I,  Sita  and  Lakshmana,  with  matted  hair  following  the 
ascetic  discipline,  will  reside  in  the  forest.  Bring  me,  therefore, 
the  milk  of  the  Bhurja  tree.1  Guha  obeyed  the  instruction  of  the 
prince,  whereupon  Rama  poured  the  viscous  liquid  on  his  own 
head  and  also  on  the  head  of  Lakshmana  !  Thus  Shri  Rama, 
that  Lion  among  men,  and  his  brother  Lakshmana  appeared  as 
ascetics  and  in  their  robes  of  bark  with  matted  locks  looked 
charming.  Taking  the  vow  of  brahmacharya,  the  two  brothers 
addressed  Guha  saying :  "  O  Guha,  do  not  neglect  thine  armies, 
thy  treasury,  thy  forces  of  defence  and  thy  people.  A  kingdom 
is  governed  through  diligence  and  exertion." 

Taking  leave  of  Guha,  Shri  Rama  with  Sita  and  Lakshmana 
went  quickly  towards  the  Ganges.  Seeing  the  boat  near  the 
bank  of  the  swiftly  flowing  river  and  desirous  of  crossing  over  it, 
Rama  said  to  Lakshmana  :  "  O  Lion  among  men,  hold  the  boat 
firm  and  aid  the  gentle  Sita  to  board  it,  then  you,  too,  enter  it." 

Acting  on  his  brother's  command,  Shri  Lakshmana  first 
assisted  the  daughter  of  the  King  of  Mithila  and  then  boarded 
the  boat  himself.  Then  the  resplendent  Rama  followed,  being 
the  last  to  enter  and  Guha  ordered  his  servants  to  row  them 
over  the  sacred  river. 

Occupying  his  seat  in  the  boat,  Prince  Rama  began  to  recite 
the  Vedic  mantra  for  the  safe  conduct  of  all.  Performing  the 
Achmana2  ritual,  he  offered  salutations  to  Shri  Gunga  and 
Lakshmana  also  made  obeisance  to  the  sacred  stream.  Shri 
Rama  once  more  bade  farewell  to  the  charioteer,  the  army  and 
Guha,  and  asked  the  helmsman  to  row  to  the  other  side.  The 
boat  moved  swiftly  to  the  sound  of  the  oars. 

Arriving  in  midstream,  the  delighted  Sita,  with  joined  palms, 
adored  Shri  Gunga,  saying :  "  O  Gunga,  may  this  son  of 
Dasaratha,  obeying  the  commands  of  his  father,  be  protected 
by  thee.  May  he,  passing  fourteen  years  in  the  forest,  'return 
again  with  Lakshmana  and  myself.    Then,  O  Devi,  O  Blessed

Gunga,  returning  with  them,  I  will  worship  thee.  0  Gunga, 
thou  art  the  fulfiller  of  pious  desires.  O  Thou  Tripartite 
Goddess,  reaching  to  the  abode  of  Brahma,  and  appearing  in 
the  mortal  realm  as  the  consort  of  the  ocean  king,  O  Beautiful 
One,  I  bow  down  to  thee  and  adore  thee.  When,  returning 
safely  from  the  forest,  Shri  Rama  occupies  the  throne,  then  I, 
desiring  to  gratify  thee,  will  give  a  hundred  thousand  cows, 
abundant  grain  and  beautiful  apparel  to  the  brahmins  in  charity. 
Returning  to  Ayodhya,  I  will  offer  a  sacrifice  of  a  hundred  jars 
of  wine  and  rice  to  thee.  I  will  worship  all  the  gods  dwelling 
on  thy  banks  and  all  the  sacred  places  such  as  Prayaga  and  Kashi. 
O  Sinless  One,  grant  that  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  free  from  sin, 
completing  the  term  of  their  exile,  return  again  to  Ayodhya." 

Thus  worshipping  the  Gunga,  the  Promoter  of  delight,  they 
reached  the  further  bank.  Then  Rama,  chief  of  men,  leaving 
the  boat  on  the  southern  shore,  proceeded  to  the  forest  with 
Lakshmana  and  Janaki,  and  addressed  Shri  Lakshmana,  saying  : 
"  O  Son  of  Sumitra,  do  thou  carefully  protect  Shri  Sita  in  the 
lonely  and  also  the  frequented  areas  of  the  forest  We  must 
guard  her  in  this  unknown  and  uninhabited  place,  therefore, 
O  Lakshmana,  do  thou  go  before  and  let  Sita  follow  thee,  I  will 
walk  behind  to  safeguard  you  both,  let  us  defend  each  other, 
O  Prince.  So  far,  Shri  Sita  has  not  made  trial  of  her  strength, 
but  from  to-day  she  must  endure  the  hardships  of  a  forest  life. 
To-day,  the  daughter  of  King  Janaka  will  enter  the  forest  where 
no  man  dwells,  nor  are  there  fields  or  gardens  there,  but  hard 
and  arid  ground  with  yawning  chasms  everywhere." 

Shri  Lakshmana,  thus  instructed,  went  ahead  with  Sita 
following  him,  Shri  Rama  coming  after. 

Meantime,  Sumantra,  on  the  further  bank,  followed  Raghava 
with  his  eyes,  and  overcome  with  grief,  wept  bitterly.  Shri 
Rama,  resplendent  as  the  earth's  guardians,  giver  of  boons, 
having  crossed  the  river  Gunga,  came  to  the  land  of  Batsya. 

Thereafter,  the  two  brothers  hunted  the  deer  and  wild  boar, 
and  other  beasts  and  growing  hungry,  fed  on  roots  and  berries, 
as  ordained,  resting  at  eventide  beneath  a  tree.

AYODHYA    KANDA 

CHAPTER     5  3 

Determined  to  follow  their  destiny  they  enter  upon  exile 

The  Delighter  of  the  World,  Shri  Rama,  sitting  beneath  a  tree 
performed  his  evening  devotion  (Sandhya)  and  then  addressed 
Shri  Lakshmana  thus  :  "  O  Brother,  this  is  our  first  night  in 
the  forest  without  Sumantra,  do  not  be  dispirited.  From  now 
on  at  night  but  one  of  us  shall  sleep,  since  the  protection  of 
Shri  Sita  is  our  care.  O  Lakshmana,  gathering  leaves  and 
grass,  let  us  prepare  a  bed  and  lay  ourselves  down." 

Shri  Rama,  accustomed  to  a  sumptuous  and  princely  couch, 
lay  that  night  on  the  bare  earth.  Conversing  with  Shri  Laksh- 
mana, he  said  :  "  O  Lakshmana,  it  may  be  that  King  Dasaratha 
slept  fitfully  this  day,  but  Kaikeyi  having  realised  her  ambition, 
is  surely  satisfied.  I  fear  that  she,  avid  for  the  kingdom,  will 
slay  the  king  'ere  Bharata  returns.  The  aged  monarch  is 
defenceless,  a  slave  to  Kaikeyi  and  subject  to  desire;  bereft 
of  me,  how  will  the  wretched  king  safeguard  himself?  Viewing 
the  king's  downfall  and  his  subjection  in  matters  of  desire,  it 
would  seem  that  concupiscence  is  more  powerful  than  wealth 
or  virtue.  O  Brother,  what  foolish  man,  swayed  by  a  woman, 
would  abandon  an  obedient  son  like  me?  Bharata  alone  is 
fortunate,  who,  with  his  consort,  having  acquired  Ayodhya, 
will  enjoy  the  kingdom. 

"  Prince  Bharata  will  become  the  ruler  of  the  whole  empire 
since  the  life  of  the  king  is  drawing  to  its  close  and  I  have 
entered  the  forest.  He  who  gives  up  righteousness  and  dis- 
regarding prosperity,  seeks  to  gratify  his  desires,  like  King 
Dasaratha,  falls  a  prey  to  sorrow.  O  Handsome  Prince,  I  deem 
that  Kaikeyi  entered  our  house  to  destroy  the  king,  to  send  me 
into  exile  and  to  install  Bharata  as  ruler  of  the  kingdom.  O 
Brother,  I  fear  that  Kaikeyi,  blinded  by  power,  may  persecute 
Kaushalya  and  Sumitra,  they  being  our  mothers.  Do  thou, 
lest  Kaushalya  and  Sumitra  suffer,  go  to  Ayodhya,  for  my  sake. 
I,  with  Sita,  will  enter  the  Dandaka  forest.  Go  thou  to  Ayodhya 
and  become  the  protector  of  the  defenceless  Queen  Kaushalya. 
The  evilly-disposed  Kaikeyi,  through  enmity  to  us,  may  cause 
277 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

injury  to  our  mothers.  O  Lakshmana,  assuredly  in  some 
previous  birth,  my  mother  has  deprived  other  women  of  their 
sons  and  is  reaping  the  fruit  of  that  action  in  this  life.  Woe 
unto  me,  that  I  should  have  to  abandon  my  mother  who  nurtured 
me  with  exceeding  love  and  should  now  enjoy  felicity.  O 
Lakshmana,  may  no  woman  give  birth  to  a  son  like  me,  who  am 
the  source  of  infinite  distress  to  my  mother.  O  Brother,  a 
maina1  taught  by  me,  cried  in  the  hearing  of  my  mother, '  Bite 
the  enemy's  foot  while  you  are  in  his  mouth  \a  O  Lakshmana, 
my  unfortunate  mother  is  to-day  sunk  in  an  ocean  of  grief  and  I 
am  not  able  to  succour  her.  Better  it  were  that  she  had  had 
no  son !  Assuredly  she  is  an  object  of  compassion,  mourning 
in  my  separation.  Alas !  what  extremity  of  grief  is  hers  to-day  ! 
O  Lakshmana,  should  I  give  way  to  wrath,  I  were  able  to  subdue 
the  world  not  to  speak  of  Ayodhya,  but  for  the  upholding  of 
righteousness,  I  may  not  demonstrate  my  power.  Should  I  do 
so,  I  should  incur  sin  and  endanger  the  life  hereafter ;  never 
will  I  take  the  kingdom  by  force." 

Thus  lamenting  in  the  lonely  forest,  Rama,  abandoning 
restraint,  passed  the  night  in  tears. 

When,  ceasing  to  lament,  Lakshmana  beheld  Rama  like  an 
extinguished  fire  or  a  calm  sea,  he  thus  addressed  him :  "  O 
Great  Hero,  deprived  of  thee,  Ayodhya  is  without  splendour, 
as  the  night,  at  the  setting  of  the  sun,  but,  O  Rama,  it  is  unworthy 
of  thee  to  grieve,  sapping  the  courage  of  Sita  and  myself. 
Like  fish  without  water,  we  cannot  live  an  instant  without  thee. 
O  Great  One,  I  do  not  desire  to  see  my  father,  my  brother 
Shatrughna  or  my  mother  Sumitra,  nor  even  heaven  itself." 

Hearing  the  words  of  Lakshmana,  full  of  good  counsel,  Shri 
Ramachandra  arose  and  seated  himself  by  Sita  on  the  bed  of 
leaves.  Determined  to  follow  his  destiny,  Shri  Rama  entered 
upon  the  period  of  exile.  From  that  day,  the  two  great  princes 
of  the  house  of  Raghu  dwelt  in  the  lonely  forest,  serene  and 
fearless  like  two  lions  dwelling  on  the  summit  of  a  mountain.

CHAPTER    54 

They  spend  the  night  at  Prayaga  in  the  hermitage  of  the  Sage 


As  the  sun  rose  in  a  cloudless  sky,  having  passed  the  night 
under  a  banyan  tree,  they  set  out  from  thence  and  proceeded 
to  where  the  Gunga  and  the  Yamuna  meet,  flowing  through 
the  vast  forest.  The  two  illustrious  brothers  journeying 
onwards  beheld  beautiful  vistas  in  the  forest,  hitherto  unseen 
by  them,  and  they,  sometimes  reclining  at  ease,  delighted  in 
the  blossoming  trees.  The  day  being  nearly  over,  Shri  Rama 
said  to  the  son  of  Sumitra :  "  O  Lakshmana,  look  towards 
Prayaga,1  smoke  is  rising  like  the  fire-god's  banner ;  undoubt- 
edly, it  is  a  sign  that  the  hermitage  of  holy  Bharadwaja  is  near. 
We  have  assuredly  reached  the  junction  of  the  Gunga  and 
Yamuna,  the  sound  of  these  mighty  rivers  clashing  together 
is  clearly  heard.  Wood-cutters  have  hewn  the  logs  from  mighty 
trees  and  many  are  cut  down  in  the  hermitage  of  the  holy  sage." 
Conversing  thus,  as  the  sun  was  setting,  the  two  great  archers 
reached  the  confluence  of  the  Gunga  and  Yamuna,  and  the 
hermitage  of  Bharadwaja.  Desiring  to  look  upon  the  holy  sage, 
they  halted  respectfully  at  some  little  distance  from  the  place. 
Then  Rama  slowly  and  reverently  entered  the  hermitage, 
beholding  there  the  omniscient  Sage  Bharadwaja  of  mighty  vows, 
the  conqueror  of  time  by  sacred  discipline.  Surrounded  by  his 
disciples,  offering  oblations  into  the  holy  fire,  they  beheld  the 
rishi,  and  Rama  with  Sita  and  Lakshmana  paid  obeisance  to  him. 
Rama  said  :  "  O  Blessed  and  Mighty  Sage,  we  are  Rama  and 
Lakshmana,  the  sons  of  King  Dasaratha,  and  this,  my  wife, 
is  the  daughter  of  Videha's  King,  this  fortunate  one  is  following 
me  to  the  lonely  Tapovana.  My  royal  sire  has  sent  me  into 
exile  and  the  son  of  Sumitra,  my  younger  brother,  ever  dear 
to  me,  taking  the  brahmacharya  vow,  has  followed  me.  O 
Blessed  Lord,  fulfilling  the  behests  of  our  father,  we  shall  enter 
the  sacred  forest  and,  practising  dharma,  live  on  roots  and 
berries." 

1  Prayaga — The  confluence  of  the  Ganges  and  Yamuna,  a  lacied  spot. 
279 


THE  RAMAYANA  OF  VALMIKI 
The  virtuous  sage,  Bharadwaja,  hearing  the  words  of  Prince 
Rama,  offering  them  madhupaika1  together  with  the  arghya, 
and  water  wherewith  to  wash  their  feet,  thereafter  gave  them 
various  roots  and  fruits.  Then  the  holy  sage  prepared  a  resting 
place  for  them.  The  Maharishi  Bharadwaja,  seated  amidst  the 
deer  and  birds,  thus  honoured  Rama,  enquiring  as  to  bis  welfare. 
Rama  receiving  the  worship  of  the  great  rishi,  reflected  on  the 
words  spoken  to  him  :  "  O  Prince,  I  behold  thee  after  a  long 
time,  I  have  heard  that  thou  wast  exiled  without  cause.  Remain 
here  at  ease  and  in  peace,  at  this  sacred  and  pleasant  place 
where  the  two  great  rivers  meet.'* 

Shri  Rama,  ever  devoted  to  the  good  of  all,  answered :  "  O 
Lord,  thy  hermitage  is  close  to  the  abodes  of  men  and  many 
will  come  hither  to  gaze  on  Sita  and  myself.  I  therefore  do 
not  deem  it  wise  to  linger  here.  O  Blessed  One,  do  thou  inform 
me  of  a  lonely  place,  where  Sita,  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  may 
live  in  happiness." 

In  gentle  accents  Shri  Bharadwaja  replied :  "  O  Child,  ten 
miles  from  here,  there  is  a  mountain,  purified  by  the  presence 
of  many  sages  who  dwell  there,  beautiful  and  pleasing  to  the 
sight,  there  do  thou  abide.  Monkeys,  bears  and  chimpanzees 
wander  there  freely.  That  mountain  is  Chittrakuta,  delightful 
as  Gandhamadana.  Those  beholding  the  peaks  of  Chittrakuta, 
obtain  spiritual  merit,  their  minds  admit  no  sin  and,  living  there, 
they  win  divine  rewards.  Many  sages,  performing  austerities 
there  for  thousands  of  years,  have  entered  heaven  in  their 
embodied  state.  0  Rama,  this  lovely  place  is  a  fit  residence 
for  thee,  I  deem,  if  thou  will  not  remain  here  with  me  until  the 
period  of  thine  exile  be  past."  Thus  Bharadwaja  honoured 
Rama  with  Sita  and  Lakshmana  offering  them  every  mark  of 
hospitality  due  to  their  royal  state.  So  in  the  hermitage  of 
the  great  sage  at  Prayaga,  Rama  spent  the  night  in  converse 
on  ancient  times.  Relieved  of  weariness,  Shri  Rama  with 
Lakshmana  and  Sita  passed  the  night  pleasantly  in  the  sacred 
hermitage.  When  morning  dawned,  Shri  Ramachandra, 
approaching  the  great  sage  made  resplendent  by  virtue  of  austere 
practices,  thus  addressed  him :    "  O  Thou  devoted  to  truth, 

1  Madhuparka — A  traditional  offering,  a  mixture  of  curds,  butter,  honey

we  have  passed  the  night  at  ease  in  thy  hermitage  now  grant  us 
leave  to  depart  to  the  place  appointed  by  thee." 

Shri  Bharadwaja  then  made  answer.  "  O  Rama,  set  out  for 
the  mountain  Chittrakuta  abounding  in  honey,  roots  and  fruit, 
worthy  to  be  thy  dwelling,  covered  with  trees  and  the  abode 
of  heavenly  beings ;  there,  peacocks  cry  and  mighty  tuskers 
roam.  Go  then  to  that  sacred  place,  which  is  pleasant  and  filled 
with  fruit  and  flowers,  and  where  elephants  and  deer  wander 
through  the  woods.  There,  lingering  with  Sita  by  the  springs 
and  waterfalls,  the  mountain  slopes  and  peaceful  caves,  thy  mind 
will  find  delight.  O  Rama,  do  thou  depart  to  dwell  on  that 
high  and  lovely  mountain  thronged  with  elephants  and  various 
beasts,  where  the  tittibha1  and  the  kokila*  sing." 


chapter   55 

They  cross  the  Yamuna  and  travel  on 

Shri  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  the  conquerors  of  their  foes,  having 
passed  the  night  in  Prayaga,  offered  obeisance  to  the  sage  and 
proceeded  towards  Chittrakuta.  On  their  departure,  Shri 
Bharadwaja  gave  them  his  blessing  as  a  father  blesses  his  son 
and  addressing  Rama,  that  hero  of  the  region  of  truth,  said : 
"  O  Great  One,  proceeding  west  of  the  junction  of  the  rivers, 
on  the  bank  of  the  Yamuna,  which  flows  into  the  swiftly-moving 
Gunga,  thou  wilt  find  a  worn-out  ferryboat.  Do  thou  pass  over 
the  stream  by  means  of  a  rod  to  which,  at  either  end,  an 
upturned  pitcher  is  hung.  On  the  opposite  shore,  thou  wilt 
behold  a  mighty  green-leaved  fig-tree  surrounded  by  many 
others.  The  leaves  of  this  tree  are  of  a  dark  green  hue  and  it 
is  frequented  by  siddhas.  Reaching  that  place,  do  thou,  with 
Janaki  pray  for  the  accomplishment  of  thy  legitimate  desires. 
Rest  there  awhile,  then  pass  beyond  it ;  reaching  Nilvan  at  a 
mile's  distance,  there  many  sala,  jamnu  and  badri3  trees  are  seen, 

1  Tittibhm — A  bird  Parra  Jacana  or  GocnsU. 

1  Kokila — The  black  or  Indian  cuckoo. 

*  Sala,  jamnu  and  badri  trees — for  trees  see  separate  glossary.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

that  is  the  way  to  Chittrakuta  and  often  have  I  journeyed  on 
that  path.  Beautiful  it  is  and  fixe  from  thorns  and  there  is 
no  danger  there  of  a  forest  fire." 

After  pointing  out  the  way  to  Shri  Rama,  the  sage  turned  back 
to  his  own  hermitage. 

Offering  salutations  to  the  saint,  Shri  Rama,  having  taken 
his  leave,  said  to  Lakshmana :  "  O  Lakshmana,  surely  we  are 
fortunate  in  that  the  holy  Rishi  has  treated  us  so  graciously." 

Conversing  thus,  the  two  princes  proceeded  onwards,  Shri  Sita 
walking  before  them,  and  came  to  the  bank  of  the  swiftly-flowing 
Yamuna.  Then  they  began  to  consider  how  they  should  pass 
over  it,  and  collecting  some  wood  constructed  a  raft,  tying 
together  lengths  of  dried  bamboo  and  filling  the  interstices 
with  kusha  grass.  Then  Lakshmana,  spreading  the  branches 
of  jambu  and  vettas  trees,  made  Sita  a  comfortable  seat.  Shri 
Sita  shyly  holding  the  hand  of  her  lord,  Shri  Rama  placed  his 
Beloved  on  the  raft  with  her  clothing  and  ornaments  beside  her. 
Thereafter  placing  the  axes  and  the  chest  covered  with  deerskins, 
containing  their  weapons  there,  the  two  brothers  began  to  sail. 
Arriving  in  mid-stream,  Shri  Sita,  bowing  low,  prayed  to  the 
holy  river  saying :  "  O  Devi,  forgive  us  for  passing  over  thee, 
grant  that  my  lord  may  fulfil  his  vow  without  obstructions. 
When  I  return,  to  please  thee  I  will  offer  a  thousand  cows 
in  charity."  Then  with  joined  palms,  she  said :  "  May  the 
Lord  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku  return  in  peace  to  the 
capital." 

Having  crossed  the  rippling  Yamuna,  the  swift  daughter  of 
the  sun,  they  reached  its  southern  bank;  there  abandoning  the 
raft,  they  entered  the  woods  and  the  river  bank  and  came  to 
the  heavily  shadowed  fig  tree. 

Shri  Sita  said :  "  O  Mighty  Tree,  I  make  obeisance  to  thee, 
may  my  lord  fulfil  his  vow,  so  that  I  may  again  behold  Shri 
Kaushalya  and  Queen  Sumitra." 

Then  Sita  circumambulated  the  tree  with  reverence  and  Rama 
beholding  the  lovely  Sita  praying  for  his  welfare,  said  to 
Lakshmana :  "  Do  thou  go  forward  with  Sita  of  whom  no  ill 
word  has  ever  been  uttered,  who  is  ever  obedient  to  me  and  is 
dearer  than  life  itself.  0  Chief  of  Men,  I,  with  my  weapons 
will  follow  after.  Whatever  fruit  or  flower  the  daughter  of 
282 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

Janaka  may  desire  in  the  forest,  do  thou  gather  for  her,  so  that 
her  mind  may  find  delight," 

Shri  Sita,  between  the  two  princes,  walked  like  a  female 
elephant  guarded  by  two  tuskers ;  the  daughter  of  Janaka, 
beholding  many  things,  formerly  unknown  to  her,  questioned 
Rama  concerning  every  tree,  shrub  and  climbing  plant.  Seeing 
many  beautiful  trees  covered  with  blossom,  Shri  Lakshmana 
brought  the  princess  all  she  desired.  Viewing  the  river  and  its 
sandy  banks  caressed  by  the  waves,  where  swans  and  cranes 
called,  Shri  Sita  was  filled  with  happiness. 

Having  travelled  some  distance,  the  two  valiant  brothers  slew 
many  deer  for  food,  then,  with  Sita,  passed  through  the  pleasant 
woods,  ringing  with  the  cries  of  peacocks  and  frequented  by 
elephants  and  monkeys. 

Perceiving  a  delightful  and  sheltered  place  which  found 
favour  with  Sita,  they  lodged  there  free  from  fear. 


CHAPTER    56 

They  reach  the  mountain  Chittrakuta  and  build  a  hut 

The  night  being  past,  Shri  Rama,  slowly  waking,  roused  the 
sleeping  Lakshmana  and  addressed  him,  saying :  "  O  Laksh- 
mana, how  beautiful  are  the  parrots,  cuckoos,  mainas  and  other 
birds  which  are  heard  here !  O  Parantapa,1  this  is  the  hour 
to  pursue  our  journey,  let  us  go  hence,  O  Prince !  " 

Shri  Lakshmana,  renouncing  sleep,  shook  off  his  drowsiness 
and  rose  refreshed.  All  of  them  rising  and  bathing  in  the  river 
Yamuna,  offered  up  their  morning  prayers.  Then,  taking  the 
path  through  the  palasa*  forest,  they  proceeded  towards  Chitt- 
rakuta as  directed  by  the  holy  sage. 

Walking  with  Lakshmana,  Rama  now  spoke  to  the  lotus-eyed 
Sita,  saying  :  "  O  Daughter  of  King  Videha,  see  how  the  spring 
has  dressed  the  palasa  trees  in  sweet-scented  blossom,  these 

1  Parantapa — Oppressor  of  the  enemy. 
*  Palais  or  Palauut  or  Panata — bread  fruit.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALM1KI 

crimson  flowers  glowing  like  fire  and  the  branches  decked  with 
flowers  as  if  adorned  with  garlands.  How  rich  in  bloom  are 
the  bilwa1  trees  untouched  by  man  who  is  not  able  to  approach 
them.  Here  we  can  easily  gather  food.  See,  O  Lakshmana, 
hanging  on  the  trees,  the  honeycombs  at  least  a  drona*  in  size, 
covered  with  bees.  How  charmingly  the  waterbird  is  singing 
and  the  peacock  answering  with  its  call,  and  look !  the  earth 
is  half  concealed  with  flowers.  Here  are  the  lofty  peaks  of 
Chittrakuta  where  countless  birds  sing  and  herds  of  elephants 
wander.  Somewhere  on  Chittrakuta  a  level  field  must  he  midst 
groves  of  trees,  a  pure  and  stainless  place,  where  we  will  dwell." 
The  two  brothers,  in  company  with  Sita,  conversing  thus, 
reached  the  pleasant  and  captivating  mountain  of  Chittrakuta. 
Coming  to  that  place,  on  which  there  were  birds  of  many 
kinds,  abounding  in  various  roots  and  pleasant  fruits  and  clear 
transparent  pools,  Rama  said  to  Lakshmana :  "  O  Gentle 
Brother,  how  pleasant  is  this  hill  covered  with  shady  trees, 
creepers  and  fruits  of  many  kinds,  appearing  delightful  and 
where  we  may  abide  unmolested.  Within  the  forest,  many  sages 
dwell,  this  place  is  meet  to  be  our  hermitage." 

Thus  resolving,  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sita  came  to  the 
hermitage  of  the  Sage  Valmiki  and,  with  reverence,  offered 
obeisance  to  him.  The  virtuous  sage,  full  of  joy,  paid  homage 
to  them,  asking  them  to  be  seated  saying :  "  You  are  most 
welcome ! " 

Shri  Rama,  presenting  himself  together  with  his  brother  and 
Sita,  related  the  cause  of  his  exile  to  the  sage  and  then  addressed 
Lakshmana,  saying :  "  O  Brother,  bring  strong  wood  and  let  us 
build  a  hut  in  this  place.  O  Excellent  Prince,  here  do  I  wish 
to  dwell." 

Shri  Lakshmana  thereupon  brought  many  pieces  of  wood, 
hewn  from  the  trees,  and  erected  a  hut  thatched  with  leaves. 
When  Shri  Rama  beheld  that  firm  and  pleasant  hut  furnished 
with  a  door,  he  said  to  the  devoted  Lakshmana:  "  O  Lakshmana, 
bring  venison  with  which  we  may  worship  the  deity  of  the 
dwelling-place  1  Since  we  purpose  to  live  here  long,  we  should 
enter  it  with  peaceful  intention  I    O  Son  of  Sumitra,  having

AYODHYA    KANDA 

killed  a  black  deer,  bring  it  here  speedily.  Let  us  follow  the 
scriptural  ordinance  in  this  matter." 

Shri  Lakshmana,  having  obeyed  his  brother's  command,  Rama 
said :  "  Now  dress  the  meat  and  we  will  offer  it  as  a  sacrifice. 
Hasten,  O  Brother,  this  is  an  auspicious  hour." 

The  illustrious  son  of  Sumitra  slew  a  black  antelope  and 
roasted  it  in  the  flames.  When  it  was  dressed  and  the  blood 
drained  from  it,  Lakshmana  addressed  Raghava,  saying  :  "  O 
Godlike  One,  I  have  prepared  the  flesh  of  the  black  deer,  now 
offer  up  the  sacrifice  to  propitiate  the  god." 

The  devout  and  resplendent  Rama,  skilled  in  silent  prayer 
and  sacrifice,  having  bathed,  recited  the  holy  texts,  offering 
homage  to  the  gods,  then  entered  the  hut,  his  heart  filled  with 
joy.  Having  adored  Rudra  and  Vishnu  for  the  purification  of 
the  dwelling,  he  read  the  Peace  Chant  and  other  propitiatory 
prayers.  Repeating  the  japa1  and  bathing  in  the  river,  he  offered 
oblations  for  the  expiation  of  sins.  He  then  erected  altars  in 
the  eight  directions  for  the  worship  of  different  gods  and 
gratifying  the  deities  presiding  over  the  elements  with  offerings 
of  flowers,  garlands,  fruits,  cooked  meats  and  the  recitation  of 
Vedic  mantrans,  he,  together  with  Sita,  entered  the  delightful 
hut,  thatched  with  leaves,  set  up  in  a  suitable  place,  sheltered 
from  the  wind. 

Shri  Rama,  of  subdued  senses,  dwelt  happily  in  that  habita- 
tion, built  in  the  forest,  the  abode  of  beasts  and  birds,  abounding 
in  trees  and  flowers,  where  elephants  wandered  and  the  cries 
of  wild  beasts  re-echoed. 

Living  on  the  pleasant  mountain,  Chittrakuta,  by  the  banks 
of  the  river  Malati,  Rama  forgot  the  capital  and  remembered 
his  renunciation  no  more.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    57 

Sumantra  returns  to  the  stricken  city  of  Ayodhya 

Separated  from  Rama,  Guha  was  filled  with  distress.  Con- 
versing long  with  the  charioteer,  he  perceived  Rama  reach  the 
southern  shore,  and  turned  homewards. 

Sumantra  hearing  fully  from  the  men  of  Shrangverpira  of 
Rama's  arrival  at  Prayaga,  his  meeting  and  residence  with  the 
Rishi  Bharadwaja  and  his  journey  towards  Chittrakuta,  bade 
farewell  to  Guha  and  yoking  his  horses  to  the  chariot,  with  a 
sorrowful  heart,  started  for  Ayodhya.  Speedily  passing  through 
flower-laden  forests  and  viewing  the  rivers,  pools,  villages  and 
towns,  he  reached  the  stricken  city  of  Ayodhya  on  the  evening 
of  the  third  day.  Seeing  the  silent  city,  he  reflected  :  "  Has 
the  city  with  its  sovereign,  men,  elephants  and  horses  been 
consumed  by  the  fire  of  grief,  caused  by  the  separation  from 
Rama?" 

Pondering  thus,  in  his  swiftly  borne  chariot,  Sumantra  reached 
the  gate  of  the  inner  city  and  entered  it.  There  innumerable 
people  rushed  towards  the  chariot  and  surrounding  it,  cried : 
"  Where  is  Shri  Rama  ?  "  "  Where  is  Shri  Rama  ?  "  and 
Sumantra  answered :  "  Having  reached  the  banks  of  the  Gunga, 
the  virtuous  Rama  ordered  me  to  return,  therefore,  I  have  come." 
Then  the  people,  finding  Rama  had  crossed  the  sacred  river, 
their  eyes  filled  with  tears,  sighing  heavily,  cried :  "  O  Rama, 
O  Rama !  "  and  all  exclaimed  with  one  voice,  "  Alas !  We 
are  deprived  of  the  sight  of  Rama,  we  are  destroyed  !  We  shall 
no  more  behold  Rama,  the  distributor  of  gifts  and  performer 
of  sacrifices,  who  sat  in  our  assemblies  and  who  resembled  the 
beautifully  adorned  Meru  mountain !  Alas  !  Where  is  Shri 
Rama,  our  protector,  acquainted  with  the  need  of  each  and  the 
happiness  of  all!" 

Then  Sumantra,  proceeding  further,  heard  on  every  side, 
through  the  lattices  of  the  houses  the  wailing  of  women 
mourning  for  Rama  and  hearing  their  lamentations  on  the  royal 
highway,  the  charioteer,  covering  his  face,  passed  quickly  on 
towards  the  palace  of  the  king. 

286 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

Descending  with  all  speed  from  his  chariot,  he  passed  beyond 
the  seven  gates  and  entered  the  royal  residence.  Seeing 
Sumantra  return  alone,  the  women,  seated  at  the  balconies  and 
windows  of  the  palace,  seven-stories  high,  languishing  in  Rama's 
separation,  broke  into  loud  lamentations.  Exchanging  glances, 
their  eyes  streaming  with  tears,  in  broken  accents  they  gave 
expression  to  their  grief.  He  heard,  too,  the  feeble  wailing 
of  the  queens  ofKingDasaratha,  saying:  "  What  will  Sumantra, 
who  went  forth  with  Rama  and  has  returned  alone,  say  to  the 
stricken  Queen  Kaushalya  ?  Surely  the  human  soul  suffers  pain 
and  anxiety  more  readily  than  joy,  since  Queen  Kaushalya  still 
lives  separated  from  Rama." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  queens  and  weighed  down  with 
sorrow,  Sumantra  entered  the  residence  of  the  king  and  passing 
through  the  eighth  door  beheld  in  the  white  chamber,  the 
wretched  king,  disconsolate  and  wasted  with  grief  on  account  of 
bis  son.  Approaching  the  king  seated  there,  Sumantra  making 
obeisance  to  him  delivered  the  message  entrusted  to  him  by 
Shri  Rama. 

The  king  heard  it  in  silence,  his  mind  agitated  with  pain 
and  grief  and  fell  unconscious  to  the  earth.  The  queens,  seeing 
the  king  fallen  in  a  swoon,  lifted  him  in  their  arms  and  covered 
him  with  tears.  Kaushalya  and  Sumitra  raising  the  fallen 
monarch  from  the  ground  addressed  him,  saying :  "  O  Thou 
Fortunate  One,  why  dost  thou  not  answer  the  messenger  of  Rama 
who  has  accomplished  his  arduous  task?  O  King,  having 
exiled  Rama,  why  art  thou  now  full  of  shame  ?  Arise,  there  is 
no  cause  for  this  distress.  O  Lord,  Queen  Kaikeyi  is  not  here, 
in  fear  of  whom  thou  dost  not  dare  address  Sumantra.  Speak 
without  fear." 

Thus  exhorting  the  king,  Queen  Kaushalya  fell  insensible, 
her  throat  choked  on  account  of  her  grief. 

The  ladies  of  the  court  and  the  other  queens,  perceiving 
Kaushalya  lying  on  the  ground  lamenting,  began  to  weep  aloud. 
Then  all  the  people  of  Ayodhya,  old  and  young,  hearing  the 
wailing  from  the  inner  apartments  of  the  palace,  broke  into 
lamentation,  as  on  the  day  when  Rama  had  left  the  city.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    58 

He  delivers  Skri  Rama*s  message  to  the  king 

The  king,  recovering  consciousness  after  a  while,  summoned 
the  royal  charioteer  and  turned  his  gaze  upon  him.  Sumantra 
reverently  approached  the  aged  monarch  who  was  grieving  and 
restless,  and  sighing  heavily  like  a  newly-captured  elephant. 
Then  the  afflicted  sovereign  spoke  to  Sumantra  who  was  most 
miserable,  his  body  covered  with  dust,  his  eyes  suffused  with 
tears,  and  said :  "  O  Charioteer,  that  virtuous  one,  worthy  of 
every  comfort  and  happiness  will  now  be  seeking  refuge  under 
a  tree.  O  !  What  will  be  his  food  ?  How  will  Rama,  the  son 
of  King  Dasaratha,  who  merits  no  suffering,  who  is  worthy  of 
resting  on  a  royal  couch,  sleep  as  one  orphaned,  on  the  bare 
earth  ?  How  can  that  prince,  formerly  accompanied  by  soldiers 
and  elephants,  and  whose  chariot  was  drawn  by  matchless  steeds, 
now  sleep  in  the  lonely  forest  ?  How  will  Rama  and  Sita  be 
able  to  dwell  in  the  forest  abounding  with  pythons  and  other 
wild  beasts  ?  O  Sumantra,  how  can  the  tender  and  sorrow- 
stricken  Sita  with  the  two  princes,  abandoning  the  chariot, 
walk  barefooted  in  the  forest  ?  O  Charioteer,  thou  art  fortunate 
in  that  thou  hast  seen  the  two  princes  wandering  in  the  forest 
like  the  Ashwini  Kumaras  on  the  mountain  Mandara.  O 
Sumantra,  when  they  entered  the  forest,  what  did  Rama  say  ? 
What  did  Lakshmana  say  ?  What  did  Sita  say  ?  O  Charioteer, 
tell  me  fully  of  Rama's  dwelling,  his  sleeping  and  his  eating, 
thus  shall  I  live  a  Httle  longer,  like  King  Yayati  of  old,  on  hearing 
the  words  of  the  sadhus." 

Thus  questioned  by  his  royal  master,  Sumantra,  his  throat 
choked,  his  speech  broken  by  sobs,  replied :  **  0  Great  King, 
Shri  Rama,  the  Upholder  of  righteousness,  reverently  joining 
his  palms  and  bowing  his  head,  said :  *  On  my  command,  offer 
salutations  again  and  again  to  the  most  praiseworthy  sovereign, 
renowned  far  and  wide  in  the  world  as  highly  virtuous,  and  to 
all  the  men  and  women  of  the  inner  apartment,  carry  tidings 
of  my  welfare  with  salutations  befitting  their  rank.  Convey 
the  news  of  my  welfare  to  my  mother  Kaushalya,  with  my 
288 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

deepest  respect  and  admonish  her  not  to  neglect  her  duty.  Let 
her  practise  dharma  and  tend  the  sacrificial  pavilion.  Say  to 
her  :  '  O  Goddess,  honour  the  king,  my  father,  as  thou  wouldst 
a  God.  Abandoning  family  pride  and  royal  prerogative, 
serve  my  other  mothers  attentively.  Kaikeyi  is  the  king's 
favourite,  do  thou  attend  to  her  as  to  the  king  himself.*  " 

"  O  King,  Shri  Rama  has  instructed  Prince  Bharata  thus : 
'  Let  it  be  known  to  the  prince,  that  I  am  well  and  instruct  him 
to  treat  all  his  mothers  with  justice.  Tell  the  illustrious  Prince 
Bharata  that,  though  regent,  he  must  continue  in  obedience 
to  his  royal  father.  The  king  is  far  advanced  in  years,  let  not 
Prince  Bharata  proclaim  himself  king.  Let  him  obey  the  king 
and  act  as  co-adjutor.' "  "  Shri  Rama  charged  me  with  tears, 
saying :  '  Let  Bharata  look  upon  my  beloved  mother  as  his 
own.'  The  mighty  armed  and  highly  illustrious  Rama  of  lotus 
eyes  addressing  me  thus,  wept  aloud. 

"Then  Shri  Lakshmana  growing  wrath  and  sighing  heavily, 
said  :  '  What  fault  has  this  noble  prince  committed  to  be  exiled  ? 
Assuredly  the  king  has  agreed  to  the  foolish  desire  of  Queen 
Kaikeyi,  granting  her  boons  without  considering  if  they  were 
proper  or  improper,  through  which  we  are  all  involved  in  misery. 
If  Rama  has  suffered  exile  to  satisfy  the  stupidity  of  Queen 
Kaikeyi,  then  assuredly  it  is  an  evil  act.  Even  if  the  gods 
decreed  the  exile  of  Rama,  I  see  no  reason  for  it.  Acting  with 
imperfect  understanding  the  king  regardless  of  consequences 
has  banished  Rama  which  will  surely  cause  him  untold  suffering. 
I  see  no  parental  affection  in  the  king ;  to  me  Shri  Ramachandra 
is  brother,  master,  relative  and  father.  The  darling  of  the  whole 
world,  Shri  Ramachandra,  devoted  to  the  good  of  all,  has  been 
banished,  how  can  the  people  approve  this  act  ?  Having,  in 
opposition  to  the  will  of  the  people,  exiled  Shri  Ramachandra, 
who  is  virtuous  and  beloved,  how  can  he  claim  to  be  a 
king? 

"The  sagacious  Janaki,  O  King,  stood  mute,  her  eyes  fixed 
and  vacant,  like  one  possessed  by  a  spirit  That  illustrious 
daughter  of  Janaka,  unacquainted  with  suffering,  wept  with 
grief  and  was  unable  to  speak.  Seeing  the  countenance  of  her 
lord  wet  with  tears,  her  mouth  became  parched,  and  gazing  at 
me,  she  wept  bitterly.  Thus  Shri  Rama,  his  face  drawn  with 
289 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

grief,  supported  by  Lakshmana,  addressed  me,  seated  in  the 
royal  chariot,  while  the  ascetic  Sita  fixed  her  gaze  on  me  in 
silence." 


chapter    59 

The  king  bewailing  the  absence  of  Rama  is  drowning  in  a  sea 
of  sorrow 

Sumantra  said :  "  O  King^when  Shri^Rama  entered  the  forest, 
I  returned  and  the  weary  horses  halting,  stood  still,  showing 
signs  of  distress.  Offering  obeisance  to  the  two  princes,  I 
mounted  the  chariot  and  restraining  my  grief,  went  forward, 
remaining  a  few  days  with  Guha,  in  the  hope  that  Shri  Rama 
might  call  me  again  and  take  me  with  him. 

"  O  King,  turning  homewards,  I  beheld  the  very  trees  filled 
with  distress,  their  tender  shoots,  buds  and  flowers  being 
withered  !  The  water  in  the  pools  and  rivers  was  slowly  ebbing 
away,  the  leaves  in  the  woods  were  falling  and  the  beasts  were 
motionless,  the  restless  elephants  no  longer  wandered  here  and 
there.  Afflicted  by  Rama's  separation,  the  forest  had  become 
silent.  O  King,  the  waters  in  the  ponds  had  grown  turbid  and 
the  lotuses  had  submerged  themselves,  being  unable  to  bear  the 
severance  from  Rama.  The  fishes  and  water  fowl  had  deserted 
their  accustomed  haunts  and  the  aquatic  plants  and  those  that 
grew  on  land  no  longer  gave  forth  their  fragrant  scents,  while 
their  fruits  were  devoid  of  taste.  Gardens  were  bereft  of  beauty 
and  birds  sat  motionless  in  the  woods. 

"  Entering  Ayodhya,  none  appeared  to  be  happy  and  the 
citizens  beholding  the  royal  chariot  without  Rama  were  perpetu- 
ally sighing.  O  Lord,  seeing,  from  a  distance,  the  chariot 
returning  without  Rama,  all  were  plunged  in  grief.  The  women 
of  the  city,  from  their  windows,  balconies  and  roofs,  seeing  the 
chariot  without  Rama,  broke  into  lamentation.  With  tears  falling 
from  their  unpainted  eyes,  full  of  distress,  they  withdrew  their 
gaze  from  all.  To-day,  I  am  unable  to  distinguish  friend  or  foe 
290 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

owing  to  grief.  All  men  together  with  elephants  and  horses, 
join  in  the  suffering  and  mourning,  all  are  afflicted  in  Rama's 
separation !  The  city  of  Ayodhya,  neglected  and  wretched, 
resembles  Queen  Kaushalya  bereft  of  her  son  !  " 

Hearing  these  words,  the  king  became  agitated  and  in  trembl- 
ing accents  addressed  the  charioteer :  "  O  Sumantra,  deeply 
penitent  am  I,  that  without  deliberating  with  my  able  counsellors 
and  elders,  I  granted  the  boons  to  the  evil-minded  Kaikeyi, 
under  the  sway  of  Manthara.  This  unpremeditated  act  was 
performed  by  me,  inspired  by  my  desire  for  Kaikeyi,  without 
consultation  with  my  friends  and  ministers.  O  Sumantra,  this 
great  calamity  is  the  result  of  fate  and  will  destroy  the  House 
of  Ikshwaku.  O  Charioteer !  If  I  have  ever  done  any  good 
to  thee,  then  take  me  to  Shri  Ramachandra  soon ;  my  life  is 
fast  ebbing  from  my  body,  or  do  thou  go  to  the  forest  and  cause 
Rama  to  return,  if  he  be  still  obedient  to  me.  If  that  Mighty 
One  be  gone  far  from  here,  then  take  me  in  the  chariot  and 
drive  there  speedily ;  I  desire  to  look  on  him  but  once  more. 
Where  is  Rama,  the  elder  brother  of  Lakshmana,  whose  teeth 
resemble  the  water  lilies  and  who  is  a  mighty  warrior  ?  If  I  am  to 
live,  I  must  see  that  virtuous  one.  If  I  do  not  behold  Rama  with 
reddened  eyes,  wearing  beautiful  earrings,  set  with  jewels,  I  shall 
assuredly  perish.  O !  What  can  exceed  my  pain,  that,  at  the 
moment  of  death,  I  am  unable  to  see  Rama,  the  hero  of  the 
House  of  Ikshwaku  ?  O  Rama,  O  Lakshmana,  O  Patient  Sita, 
you  do  not  know  that  I  am  dying  in  bitter  anguish." 

The  king,  his  mind  drowned  in  the  sea  of  sorrow,  cried  : 
"  O  Kaushalya,  that  ocean  of  misery  caused  by  Rama's  separation 
is  fathomless,  severance  from  Sita  are  its  shores,  deep  sighs 
are  the  whirlpools  rendered  turbid  by  my  tears,  the  stretching 
of  the  arms  are  its  restless  motion,  lamentations  are  the  sound 
of  its  thunder,  dishevelled  hair  are  the  weeds,  the  words  of 
Manthara  are  the  crocodiles  and  Kaikeyi  is  the  tire  in  its  depths, 
the  unscaleable  cliffs  are  the  boons  which  sent  Rama  to  the  forest. 
Without  Rama,  I  am  sinking  in  this  bottomless  sea,  living,  I  am 
unable  to  cross  over  it.  I  desire  to  see  Rama  and  Lakshmana 
this  day,  but  alas  1  I  am  unable  to  obtain  my  desire,  as  a  result 
of  some  great  sin  formerly  committed  by  me." 

Thus  complaining,  the  king  fell  senseless  on  the  couch.  The 
391 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

monarch,  bewailing  the  absence  of  Rama,  swooned  away.  Hear- 
ing the  king's  words,  the  mother  of  Rama,  Queen  Kaushalya, 
was  seized  with  fear. 


CHAPTER    60 

The  charioteer  attempts  to  console  Queen  Kaushalya 

Queen  Kaushalya,  lying  trembling  on  the  ground  like  one  dead 
or  possessed  by  an  evil  spirit,  now  said  to  the  charioteer :  "  O 
Sumantra,  take  me  to  the  place  where  Rama,  Lakshmana  and 
Janaki  dwell !  Life  without  them,  even  for  a  moment,  is  vain. 
Speedily  return  there  in  thy  chariot,  either  I  must  follow  them  or 
enter  the  region  of  death." 

Shri  Sumantra,  weeping  and  distressed,  respectfully  sought 
to  console  the  Queen,  saying :  "  O  Lady,  abandon  disquiet, 
infatuation  and  anxiety  born  of  grief!  Shri  Rama  will  live 
happily  in  the  forest !  Prince  Lakshmana,  self-subdued, 
serving  Rama  and  living  in  accordance  with  virtue  will  fashion 
for  himself  an  auspicious  future.  In  the  solitary  forest,  Shri 
Sita,  her  mind  wholly  centered  on  Rama  in  devotion,  will  live 
without  fear,  as  in  her  own  home.  I  see  no  lack  of  courage 
in  Princess  Sita,  it  would  appear  that  she  was  born  to  reside 
in  a  strange  land.  As  in  former  days,  she  enjoyed  the  parks 
and  gardens,  so  does  she  now  enjoy  the  uninhabited  forest.  Sita, 
whose  countenance  resembles  the  full  moon,  her  mind  absorbed 
in  Rama,  depending  on  him,  sports  in  the  forest ;  with  her 
heart  and  mind  centred  on  him,  she  would  hold  this  great  capital 
no  better  than  a  wilderness  without  Rama.  Walking  in  the 
forest,  seeing  the_  villages,  rivers,  towns  and  various  kinds  of 
trees,  she  enquires  of  Rama  concerning  their  history  and  origin. 
To  her,  the  forest  is  a  pleasure  garden  in  the  neighbourhood 
of  Ayodhya.  This  I  remember  of  Sita,  but  what  she  said  of 
Kaikeyi  now  slips  my  mind." 

Sumantra,  carefully  withholding  the  reference  to  Kaikeyi 
which  had  escaped  from  him  through  inadvertence  and  in  order 
aoa 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

to  propitiate  Queen  Kaushalya,  addressed  her  further,  saying : 
"  The  lustre  of  the  face  of  Janata  is  not  marred  by  the  fatigue' 
of  the  journey  or  the  winds  or  through  fear  of  dangerous  beasts 
or  through  the  heat  of  the  sun.  The  countenance  of  the 
Princess,  resembling  the  full  moon  is  not  impaired  by  residence 
in  the  forest.  Her  feet,  no  longer  painted  with  vermilion, 
appear  as  fresh  as  lotuses. 

The  princess  ever  exceedingly  devoted  to  Rama,  has  not  put 
off  her  ornaments,  but  with  her  tinkling  anklets  trips  happily 
along,  causing  the  very  swans  to  envy  her.  Depending  on  the 
power  of  Shri  Rama,  she  suffers  no  fear  at  the  sight  of  a  lion 
or  tiger  in  the  forest.  O  Lady,  there  is  no  cause  for  grief 
for  these  three  or  for  the  king  or  thyself.  The  self-imposed  exile 
of  Shri  Rama,  in  obedience  to  his  father's  command,  will  remain 
a  subject  for  veneration  to  the  whole  world,  as  long  as  the  sun 
and  moon  abide.  Having  banished  sorrow,  Shri  Rama  pursuing 
the  path  trodden  by  the  sages,  living  on  fruits  and  berries, 
fulfils  the  behest  of  his  sire." 

Though  consoled  by  the  charioteer,  Queen  Kaushalya,  torn 
with  grief,  in  the  separation  from  her  son,  cried  out :  "  O  My 
Darling,  O  My  Son,  O  Rama,"  and  continued  to  weep. 


chapter   6  x 

Queen  Kaushalya  reproaches  the  fang 

The  virtuous  Rama,  the  upholder  of  dharma,  having  departed, 
Queen  Kaushalya  weeping  bitterly,  addressed  her  royal  consort : 
"  O  King,  Thy  fair  name  is  known  throughout  the  three  worlds  ; 
thou  art  esteemed  compassionate,  charitable  and  of  gentle  speech. 
Yet,  O  Great  One,  tell  me,  how  will  thy  two  sons,  brought  up 
in  ease  together  with  Sita,  be  able  to  endure  the  forest  life  ? 
How  will  the  young  and  tender  Sita,  worthy  of  happiness, 
endure  heat  and  cold?  How  will  that  large-eyed  princess, 
who  lived  on  dishes  prepared  by  skilful  cooks,  sustain  life 
on  the  wild  lentils  of  the  forest  ?  How  will  she,  accustomed 
293 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

to  the  sweet  strains  of  music,  be  able  to  bear  the  roaring  of 
man-eating  lions  ?  How  will  the  two  mighty  princes,  whose 
arms  resemble  the  rainbow,1  sleep  on  the  ground,  pillowing 
their  heads  on  their  arms.  O  When  will  I  again  behold  the 
lotus  face  of  Rama,  framed  in  beautiful  locks,  whose  eyes  are 
like  the  water-lily  and  whose  breath  is  fragrant  as  the  nymphoea  ? 
Surely  my  heart  must  be  as  hard  as  a  diamond  that  it  does 
not  break  into  a  thousand  pieces,  bereft  of  Rama.  0  King, 
in  banishing  thy  children,  thou  hast  been  merciless.  Worthy 
of  every  comfort,  they  are  now  wandering  aimlessly  in  the  forest. 
Should  Rama  return,  after  fourteen  years,  will  Prince  Bharata 
restore  the  kingdom  and  the  treasure  to  him  ?  If  those  inviting 
the  pious  and  learned  brahmins  to  the  funeral  sacrifice,  first  serve 
their  poor  and  deserving  relations  and  subsequently  the  brahmins 
these  will  not  accept  the  food  of  that  sacrifice,  renouncing  it 
like  wine.  The  learned  brahmins  regard  it  as  a  mark  of 
disrespect  to  be  served  even  with  that  in  which  other  brahmins 
have  already  participated,  which  is  like  a  bull  shorn  of  its  horns, 
of  lesser  worth.  O  Master  of  thy  People,  will  not  Rama  even 
thus  disdain  the  kingdom  enjoyed  by  his  younger  and  un- 
deserving brother?  A  lion  will  not  eat  the  food  killed  by 
another,  neither  will  Rama  accept  that  which  has  already  been 
enjoyed  by  others.  As  the  libations,  butter,  kusha  grass  and 
pillars  employed  in  the  sacrifice,  are  not  used  again,  so  will  Rama 
not  accept  a  kingdom  which  resembles  a  sacrifice  without  soma.* 
Shri  Rama  will  never  suffer  this  indignity,  as  a  lion  will  not 
suffer  the  twisting  of  its  tail.  Do  not  all  fear  Rama  as  he  appears 
on  the  battlefield?  He,  himself,  is  righteous,  indicating  the 
path  of  virtue  to  others,  never  will  he  seize  the  kingdom  by  force ! 
Is  not  the  mighty-armed  Rama  with  his  golden  shafts,  able  to 
destroy  all  living  beings  and  dry  up  the  sea  ?  Yet  to-day,  that 
Rama,  powerful  as  a  lion,  is  rendered  impotent  at  the  king's 
command,  as  the  spawn  of  fishes  is  devoured  by  their  parents  ? 
O  King,  hadst  thou  regarded  the  scriptures  and  the  eternal  laws, 
observed  and  inculcated  by  the  learned  sages,  thy  virtuous  son 
had  not  been  exiled  by  thee.  O  Lord,  the  first  support  of  a 
woman  is  her  husband,  the  second  is  her  son,  the  third  her

relatives,  but  a  fourth  she  has  not !  Thou  hast  ceased  to  regard 
me  as  thine,  thou  hast  banished  my  son  Rama,  and  I  may  not 
follow  him  and  leave  thee  desolate.  O  Lord,  thou  hast  destroyed 
me  utterly !  O  King,  thou  hast  brought  disaster  on  thy 
counsellors,  the  whole  kingdom,  the  ministers  and  thyself,  and 
I  with  my  son  and  all  the  citizens  of  Ayodhya  are  utterly  ruined." 
Hearing  the  bitter  reproaches  of  his  consort,  the  king,  reflecting 
on  the  cause  of  this  calamity,  overwhelmed  with  grief,  fell 
senseless,  drowned  in  the  sea  of  sorrow. 


CHAPTER    62 
The  king  is  overcome  with  grief 

Filled  with  anguish  on  hearing  the  harsh  words  of  Queen 
Kaushalya,  the  king  began  to  reflect  on  what  could  be  done. 
Regaining  consciousness,  he  sighed  heavily  and  began  to  ponder 
within  himself.  He  then  remembered  how,  formerly,  he  had 
slain  a  young  ascetic  inadvertently  by  a  sound-directed  arrow, 
in  the  forest. 

The  monarch  was  now  subject  to  a  dual  cause  of  grief,  the 
recollection  of  his  former  evil  deed  and  his  banishment  of  Rama. 
Thus  afflicted,  with  bowed  head,  the  king  addressed  the  queen 
in  faltering  tones :  "  O  Kaushalya,  ever  compassionate  to  thine 
enemies,  I  entreat  thee,  with  joined  palms,  not  to  look  on  me 
with  hostility.  O  Lady,  to  the  wife,  the  husband  is  a  deity 
be  he  virtuous  or  worthless,  this  is  the  eternal  law.  I  know 
thee  to  be  wise  and  acquainted  with  what  is  proper  and  improper, 
it  is  not  meet  that  thou  shouldst  utter  these  wounding  words.** 

Hearing  this  plaintive  speech,  tears  welled  from  the  eyes  of 
the  queen  like  tailing  rain  and  taking  his  hands  in  hers,  she 
addressed  the  king,  saying :  "  O  Lord,  do  not  grieve,  be  at  peace, 
see,  I  lay  my  head  at  thy  feet,  do  not  entreat  me,  it  is  as  death 
to  me  I  I  have  spoken  what  ought  not  to  be  uttered,  pardon 
my  transgression  1  That  woman  is  not  nobly  bred*  who  expects 
295 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

her  lord  to  solicit  her  with  humble  words.  O  Sire,  I  am 
acquainted  with  a  woman's  duty  and  I  know  thee  to  be  a  lover 
of  virtue.  What  I  have  said  was  uttered  involuntarily  through 
distress  on  account  of  my  son.  Grief  destroys  patience,  grief 
destroys  the  understanding,  there  is  nothing  more  destructive 
than  grief!  The  blow  of  an  unknown  enemy  may  be  endured 
but  the  distress  arising  from  grief  is  not  easily  borne,  even  with 
resignation.  This  is  only  the  fifth  night  since  the  exile  of  Rama 
but  to  me  they  are  as  five  years.  Sorrow  has  driven  away 
every  joy  from  my  breast  and  because  of  Rama  my  pain  increases, 
agitating  my  heart  as  the  waters  of  a  swifdy  flowing  river 
disturb  the  ocean." 

While  the  queen  was  yet  speaking,  the  sun  declined  and  the 
night  fell.  Consoled  by  the  words  of  Queen  Kaushalya,  the 
king,  wearied  with  grief,  sank  into  slumber. 


chapter   63 

He  recalls  a  former  evil  deed  which  is  the  cause  of  his 
present  distress 

A  full  hour  having  passed,  the  king  awoke  and  was  overcome 
with  distress.  He  began  to  ponder  deeply,  but  his  mind  was 
clouded  with  grief  and  though  equal  to  Indra,  death  threatened 
to  seize  him  as  Rahu1  seizes  the  sun. 

The  sixth  night  after  Rama's  exile,  the  king  again  remembered 
his  former  evil  deed  and  agitated  by  the  recollection  of  his  sin, 
he  addressed  the  Queen  Kaushalya  :  "  O  Kalyani,  O  Auspicious 
One,  whatever  man  does,  be  it  good  or  evil,  he  gathers  the  fruit 
thereof.  He  is  deemed  ignorant  who  does  not  consider  the  merit 
or  demerit  of  his  actions  before  performing  them.  O  Queen, 
he,  who,  enjoying  the  red  flowers  of  the  palasa  tree,  cuts  down 
the  adjoining  mango  tree  and  yet  desires  to  partake  of  mangoes, 
will  not  realize  his  expectation  when  the  palasa  bears  fruit.  He, 

1  Rahu — a  mythical  demon  said  to  cause  the  eclipse  of  sun  or  moon. 
296 


AYODHYA    KANDA 
who,  heedless  of  the  consequences,  enters  into  action,  will  in 
the  end  repent  like  the  man  who  waters  the  palasa  tree. 

"  O  Lady,  I  have  cut  down  the  mango  tree  and  watered  the 
palasa  tree,  now,  when  the  fruit  is  ripe,  I  too,  having  banished 
Rama,  repent  bitterly.  O  Kaushalya,  in  order  to  be  esteemed 
as  an  archer,  in  my  youth,  I  directed  my  arrows  by  sound  alone, 
and  a  grievous  deed  was  committed  by  me.  I  am  the  cause 
of  this  present  distress.  0  Queen,  as  a  child  swallows  poison 
in  ignorance,  so  have  I  destroyed  my  happiness  by  this  deed 
formerly  committed  in  ignorance.  As  one  beguiled  by  the 
beauty  of  the  palasa  flower,  waters  it  in  expectation  of  the  sweet 
fruit  (of  the  mango)  so  did  I  cultivate  the  fruit  I  now  reap, 
by  shooting  at  a  sound.  O  Lady,  in  those  days  we  were  not 
united  in  marriage  and  I  was  heir-apparent. 

"At  that  time,  the  rainy  season  being  near,  the  increase  of  desire 
having  come,  the  sun  drying  up  the  earth,  scorching  the  world 
with  its  rays,  entered  the  southern  path.  Then  the  heat  subsided 
and  refreshing  clouds  covered  the  sky,  delighting  the  peacocks, 
the  frogs  and  the  swallows.  The  birds  drenched  with  the  rain, 
passed  the  night  in  distress,  tossed  to  and  fro  on  the  trees  by 
the  humid  winds.  The  limpid  water  in  the  streams  dark  and  turgid 
from  deposits  of  the  mountain  soil,  flowed  onwards  sluggishly. 

"  In  that  delightful  season,  taking  my  bow  and  arrows  in  my 
chariot,  I  came  to  the  bank  of  the  river  Sarayu,  desiring  to  hunt. 
Taking  my  stand  at  a  ford,  where  buffaloes,  elephants  and  tigers 
came  at  night  to  drink,  I  heard  the  sound  as  of  a  pitcher  being 
filled  with  water  in  the  darkness.  Seeing  nought  and  deeming 
it  to  be  the  sound  of  an  elephant,  I  took  from  my  quiver  an 
arrow  dipped  in  the  poison  of  a  snake  and  discharged  it  whence 
the  sound  came.  Having  discharged  the  keen  and  poisoned 
shaft,  I  heard  the  voice  of  a  youth  crying  out,  and  he,  pierced 
in  the  side,  fell  exclaiming  '  Who  has  shot  an  ascetic  who 
has  no  enemy  in  the  whole  world  ?  Desirous  of  drawing  water, 
I  came  here  in  the  dead  of  night.  What  harm  had  I  done 
to  him  who  has  smitten  me  ?  Why  should  I,  who  live  on 
fruits  and  roots  in  the  forest,  and  have  injured  none  by  word 
or  deed,  be  slain  by  weapons  ?  What  gain  is  there  in  destroying 
one  wearing  bark  and  deerskin  ?  To  whom  have  I  done  an 
injury  ?  Such  an  act  is  unlawful,  as  one  who  does  not  respect 
297 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  couch  of  his  Guru  is  considered  an  abandoned  person,  so 
he  who  has  wrongfully  smitten  me,  cannot  be  a  virtuous  man. 
I  do  not  grieve  for  the  loss  of  my  own  life,  but  for  what  will 
befall  my  parents,  when  I  die !  To  what  condition  will  they 
be  brought  on  my  death,  that  aged  pair  so  long  supported  by  me  ? 
My  mother,  my  father  and  I  have  been  killed  by  a  single  arrow  ! 
By  what  foolish  man  have  we  all  been  slain  ? ' 

"  O  Kaushalya,  I,  ever  desirous  of  acquiring  virtue  and 
eschewing  what  was  evil,  hearing  this  sad  complaint,  became 
exceedingly  distressed  and  the  bow  fell  from  my  hands.  The 
lament  of  the  sage  caused  me  the  deepest  affliction  and  over- 
whelmed with  grief  I  advanced  to  where  he  lay,  wounded  by 
my  arrow.  There  I  beheld  him  lying  on  the  ground,  his  hair 
dishevelled,  his  body  besmeared  with  blood  and  dust,  the  water 
flowing  from  his  loshta1  which  lay  at  some  distance  from  him. 
Seeing  me  standing  there  dismayed,  he  fixed  me  with  his  gaze 
as  if  he  would  consume  me,  and  said :  '  O  King,  what  harm 
have  I,  a  dweller  in  the  forest,  done  to  thee,  that  thou  hast 
wounded  me  while  fetching  water  from  the  river  for  my  aged 
parents  ?  Thou  hast  inflicted  a  mortal  wound  by  thine  arrow 
and  have  in  this  wise  slain  my  mother  and  father  also,  who  weak, 
aged  and  blind  and  the  victims  of  exceeding  thirst,  await  my 
return.  Afflicted  with  thirst,  they  are  watching  for  my  return. 
Alas !  what  fruit  have  I  earned  by  the  practice  of  penance 
and  the  hearing  of  the  Veda  and  Puranas1  since  my  father  does 
not  know  that  I  am  lying  mortally  wounded  here  ?  Yet  if  he 
knew,  what  could  he  do,  since  he  is  blind  and  a  cripple  ?  As 
a  tree  cut  down  cannot  support  another,  so  my  parents  blind 
and  crippled  cannot  assist  me.  O  King,  go  speedily  to  my  father 
and  inform  him  of  my  plight.  I  fear  lest  he  curse  thee  and 
consume  thee  as  a  fire  burns  up  wood  I  O  King,  the  path  beheld 
by  thee  leads  to  my  parents'  hut.  Do  thou  go  there  and 
propitiate  them,  O  King,  that  they  may  not  wax  wrath  and 
curse  thee.  O  King,  free  my  side  from  this  shaft ;  this  arrow 
penetrating  my  body  resembles  a  river  that  washes  away  the 
long  and  sandy  bank.'

"  O  Lady,  I  reflected  that  as  long  as  the  arrow  remained  fixed 
he  would  not  die,  though  suffering  great  pain,  but  should  I 
extract  it,  he  would  certainly  perish.  The  son  of  the  muni, 
seeing  me  afflicted  and  reading  my  thoughts  addressed  me  in 
great  agony  and  said :  *  O  King,  though  in  anguish  and  confused, 
my  body  quivering  with  pain  and  about  to  die,  yet  I  am  able 
to  control  my  distress  and  am  at  peace.  Dismiss  thy  fears, 
OKing,  though  thy  sin  is  grievous,  thou  hast  not  slain  a  brahmin.1 
O  King,  I  am  born  of  a  shudra  mother  and  a  vaishya  father.' 

"As  he  was  speaking,  his  eyes  rolling,  his  face  blanched, 
struggling  and  quivering  on  the  earth,  I  withdrew  the  arrow 
and  he,  looking  up  in  agony,  yielded  up  his  breath. 

"  O  Queen,  deeply  afflicted,  I  beheld  that  treasury  of  truth, 
lamenting,  his  body  bathed  in  sweat,  in  the  act  of  giving  up 
his  life." 


CHAPTER    64 

Overborne  by  grief  the  king  yields  up  his  life 

The  king,  grieving  over  the  separation  from  his  son,  continued 
to  describe  the  infamous  deed,  the  slaying  of  the  young  ascetic, 
to  the  queen  and  said : — 

"  O  Kaushalya,  having  unwittingly  committed  this  impious 
deed,  I,  deeply  distressed,  reflected  what  could  now  be  done 
and  decided  to  seek  out  the  parents  and  propitiate  them.  Taking 
the  pitcher,  filled  with  water,  I  bore  it  to  the  ascetic's  hermitage 
and  there  beheld  his  mother  and  father,  aged  and  feeble,  seated 
together,  like  two  birds  bereft  of  their  wings.  Motionless, 
deprived  by  me  of  their  support,  they  sat,  conversing  of  their  son 
and  awaiting  the  water.  My  mind  was  clouded  with  grief  and 
X  was  smitten  with  fear,  but  seeing  the  aged  pair,  my  anguish 
was  increased  a  thousandfold. 

"  Hearing  the  sound  of  my  steps,  the  father  spoke :  *  O  My 

1  A  deadly  sin,  the  five  mortal  sins  being :  the  murder  of  a  brahmin,  the 
drinking  of  intoxicating  liquor,  theft,  adultery  with  the  wife  of  the  spiritual

Son,  why  hast  thou  delayed  so  long  ?    Give  me  water  speedily, 

0  Child,  why  hast  thou  been  diverting  thyself  in  the  water  ? 
Come  quickly  into  the  hermitage,  thy  mother  is  exceedingly 
anxious.  O  My  Son,  if  aught  thy  mother  has  done  has  displeased 
thee,  it  behoves  thee  to  forget  it.  Thou  art  our  only  support 
who  are  blind  and  crippled;  thou  art  our  very  eyes,  our 
lives  are  dependent  on  thee,  why  dost  thou  not  speak  to  us  ?  * 

"  Beholding  the  muni,  and  as  one  sorely  dismayed,  I  uttered 
inarticulate  words,  then  by  force  of  will,  controlling  my  speech, 

1  related  to  him  the  whole  misfortune.  Slowly,  I  narrated  to 
the  sage  the  distressing  fate  that  had  befallen  his  son  and  said : 
'  O  Mahatma,  I  am  not  thy  son,  my  name  is  Dasaratha  and  I 
am  a  kshatriya.  A  sinful  act  has  been  committed  by  me  of 
which  1  now  repent.  O  Lord,  armed  with  bow  and  arrow  I 
came  to  the  bank  of  the  Sarayu  to  hunt  the  elephant,  tiger 
or  lion,  that  might  come  there  to  drink.  Hearing  the  sound 
of  a  pitcher  being  filled  with  water  and  supposing  it  to  be  an 
elephant,  I  discharged  an  arrow  and  coming  to  the  bank  of 
the  river  beheld  an  ascetic  lying  on  the  ground  pierced  to  the 
heart  by  my  weapon.  O  Lord,  having  mistaken  thy  son,  who 
had  gone  to  seek  water,  for  an  elephant,  I  slew  him  by  an  arrow 
discharged  on  hearing  that  sound.  On  his  entreaty  I  extracted 
the  arrow  from  his  heart  causing  him  pain  and  he  left  this  life 
lamenting  for  his  blind  parents.  Thy  son  was  suddenly  and 
unknowingly  slain  by  me  without  design ;  what  was  to  happen, 
has  been  accomplished.  Thou  art  a  sage,  now  do  what  thou 
considerest  proper.1 

"  Hearing  the  tale  of  my  evil  deed  from  my  own  lips,  the  sage 
retrained  from  pronouncing  a  curse  on  me.  His  eyes  suffused 
with  tears  and  his  heart  distressed,  he  addressed  me  who 
supplicated  him  with  joined  palms,  saying :  *  O  King,  if  thou 
thyself  had*st  not  confessed  this  evil  deed  to  me,  thy  head  had 
instantly  split  into  a  thousand  pieces  by  my  curse.  O  King, 
the  killing  of  one  dwelling  in  the  forest  by  a  kshatriya  causes 
him  to  lose  his  status,  even  if  he  be  Indra.  If  anyone  knowingly 
attacks  a  sage  or  spiritual  preceptor  with  a  weapon,  his  head 
is  severed  into  seven  pieces.  Thou  livest  still,  since  the  deed 
was  done  by  thee  without  design,  else  hadst  thou  and  the  whole 
House  of  Raghu  perished. '

"  O  Kaushalya,  the  sage  said :  *  Take  me  to  the  place  where 
the  body  of  my  son  is  lying,  I  wish  to  acquaint  myself  with 
his  final  state.  Alas  !  Under  the  decree  of  destiny  he  is  lying 
lifeless  on  the  earth,  his  body  besmeared  with  blood,  stripped 
of  the  deerskin  formerly  worn  by  him.* 

"  0  Kaushalya,  taking  the  deeply  distressed  sage  and  his  wife 
to  that  place,  they,  with  their  fingers  touched  the  lifeless  body 
of  their  son.  Approaching  the  place,  they  embraced  the  dead 
body  of  their  child,  the  father  crying  :  '  O  Child,  thou  art  to-day 
not  bidding  us  welcome,  nor  dost  thou  speak  to  me.  Why  art 
thou  lying  on  the  earth,  art  thou  displeased  ?  O  My  Son,  if 
thou  art  angry  with  me,  regard  thy  virtuous  mother.  Why 
dost  thou  not  embrace  me  and  speak  tender  words  to  me? 
Now  that  half  the  night  has  gone,  who  will  read  the  Scriptures 
and  Puranas  in  gentle  accents  to  me  ?  O  My  Son,  who  will 
perform  our  morning  ablutions  and  after  offering  up  his  morning 
devotions,  serve  and  console  us  ?  Helpless  and  destitute,  who  will 
gather  roots,  berries  and  fruits  for  me  in  the  forest,  and  feed  me, 
like  a  beloved  guest  ?  O  My  Son,  how  shall  I  nourish  and 
support  thy  mother,  blind,  ascetic  and  devoted  to  her  son? 
O  My  Child,  stay,  stay,  do  not  yet  enter  the  abode  of  Yama. 
To-morrow  thy  mother  and  I  will  accompany  thee.  Without  thee 
we  are  distressed,  helpless  and  bereft  of  support,  we  will  accom- 
pany thee  to  the  abode  of  Yama.  Beholding  the  Lord  of  Death, 
we  shall  say  to  him,  "Forgive  our  transgressions  of  the  past 
which  have  caused  us  to  be  separated  from  our  son  and  let 
him  yet  be  our  support.  Grant  us  this  blessing,  O  Lord  of 
Death,  and  make  us  free  from  fear.  Thou  art  just  and  the 
renowned  protector  of  thy  realm  ?  O  My  Son,  thou  art  innocent 
and  hast  been  slain  by  a  sinful  man,  therefore,  by  the  power  of 
truth,  enter  thou  the  abode  of  heroes.  Go,  my  son  to  that  high 
state  attained  by  those  who  follow  truth  and  suffer  death  at  the 
hands  of  their  foes,  without  retreating.  Go  to  that  high  region 
attained  by  Sagara,1  Shivya,*  Dilipa,3  Janamejaya,*  Nahusha8  and

Dhundhumara.1  That  state  attained  by  those  versed  in  the  Veda 
and  practising  austerity,  be  thine.  That  state,  O  My  Son,  of 
those  who  attend  the  sacred  fire,  of  those  highly  generous  persons 
who  make  gifts  of  land  in  charity,  may  that  state  acquired 
by  those  who  give  thousands  of  cows  in  charity  and  serve 
their  Guru  single  mindedly,  or  those  courting  death  by  fire 
in  meditation,  be  thine.  None  born  of  thy  family  has  ever 
descended  to  a  lower  state  but  he  who  has  slain  our  son  shall 
end  in  misery  ".* 

"  Thus  for  a  long  time  wailing  in  distress,  the  aged  parents 
began  to  offer  ceremonial  water  for  their  dead  son.  The  son 
of  that  sage  by  virtue  of  his  meritorious  deeds  ascending  to 
heaven  in  a  celestial  form,  in  the  company  of  Indra  addressed  bis 
parents  with  consoling  words,  saying :  *  By  virtue  of  my 
services  to  you,  I  have  obtained  this  state,  you,  too,  will  soon 
join  me  here.'  Thereafter,  that  self-controlled  ascetic  ascended 
to  heaven  in  an  aerial  chariot.  O  Lady,  that  great  sage  with 
his  wife  performing  the  water  ritual,  said  to  me  standing  near 
with  joined  palms :  *  O  King,  now  put  an  end  to  my  life  also, 
I  shall  feel  no  grief  in  dying.  This  was  my  only  son  and  by 
slaying  him  thou  hast  rendered  me  childless.  As  he  was  slain 
by  thee,  I  pronounce  a  curse  on  thee.  Mayest  thou  suffer  the 
the  same  grief  that  thou  hast  caused  to  me,  through  separation 
from  thy  son,  ending  in  thy  death.  O  King,  having  slain  the 
sage  unknowingly,  the  guilt  of  killing  a  brahmin  will  not  be 
thine.  As  the  dispenser  of  charity  receives  the  merit  of  those 
gifts,  so  wilt  thou  suffer  in  the  degree  of  the  suffering  thou  hast 
caused  me,  putting  an  end  to  thy  life.' 

"  O  Queen,  having  cursed  me,  they  lamented  for  some  time 
and  then  gathering  wood,  kindled  a  fire,  and  entering  it,  departed 
this  life.  O  Lady,  to-day  recalling  that  evil  deed,  committed 
thoughtlessly  in  my  youth,  by  discharging  the  arrow  by  sound, 
the  fruit  of  my  action  has  overtaken  me,  as  illness  follows  the 
partaking  of  unwholesome  food.  O  Noble  Lady,  the  time  of 
the  fulfilment  of  the  sage's  curse  has  come." 

Having  said  this,  the  king  weeping  and  overcome  with  fear 
on  the  approach  of  death,  spoke  again :  "  O  Kaushalya,  I  am

about  to  yield  up  my  life  through  grief  for  my  son,  I  am  unable 

to  sec  thee,  do  thou  draw  near  and  touch  me.  Those  about 
to  enter  the  abode  of  death  distinguish  nought.  If  Rama  could 
but  touch  me  for  an  instant,  or  receive  my  wealth  and  the  regency, 
I  might  yet  live.  O  Auspicious  Lady,  I  have  not  dealt 
justly  with  Rama,  but  what  he  has  done  to  me  is  right.  What 
thoughtful  man  would  abandon  even  a  sinful  son  ?  But  what 
son,  sent  into  exile  will  not  think  ill  of  his  father  ?  O  Kaushalya, 
I  no  longer  behold  thee,  my  memory  is  also  fading.  O  Queen, 
the  messengers  of  death  call  on  me  to  depart ;  what  affliction 
is  greater  than  this,  that  at  the  hour  of  death  I  do  not  behold 
the  virtuous  Rama,  the  hero  of  truth  ?  The  grief  caused  by 
the  absence  of  my  son,  who  never  opposed  my  wishes,  dries  up 
my  life  as  heat  dries  up  water.  They  are  not  men,  they  are 
gods,  who  will  look  on  that  lovely  countenance  of  lotus  eyes  and 
charming  features  after  fourteen  years  !  Blessed  are  those  who 
will  behold  the  face  of  Rama  resembling  the  full  moon,  returning 
to  Ayodhya.  Fortunate  are  they  who  will  behold  Rama  in  the 
capital  like  the  planet  Shukra,1  completing  its  course  in  the 
heavens.  O  Kaushalya,  my  heart  is  breaking,  I  have  lost  the 
sense  of  touch,  taste  and  sound.  When  the  mind  expires,  the 
senses  are  extinguished  as  the  flame  of  a  lamp  subsides  when 
the  oil  is  consumed.  O  Grief,  thou  art  destroying  me  and 
carrying  away  my  life  as  a  river  bears  away  the  banks  by  its 
force !  O  Prince,  O  Mighty  Hero,  O  Sole  Remover  of  my  pain, 
O  Darling  of  Thy  Sire,  O  My  Master,  My  Son,  where  art  thou  ? 
O  Kaushalya,  O  Virtuous  Sumitra,  I  depart!  O  My  Cruel 
Enemy  Kaikeyi,  destroyer  of  my  family's  felicity." 

Thus  lamenting,  the  king  died  in  the  presence  of  Rama's 
mother  and  the  Queen  Sumitra. 

Overborne  by  the  grief  caused  by  the  exile  of  his  son,  that 
generous  and  mighty  king,  at  midnight,  yielded  up  his  life.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 
CHAPTER    65 

The  palace  is  fitted  with  the  sound  of  distress 

The  night  having  passed,  at  dawn,  according  to  custom,  the 
bards  arrived  at  the  palace  of  the  long,  the  traditional  singers, 
those  versed  in  rhetoric  and  in  the  history  of  the  dynasty,  and 
skilled  musicians  acquainted  with  rhythm  and  melody,  began  to 
sing  the  praises  of  the  king.  The  sound  of  their  eulogies  and 
their  songs  filled  the  whole  palace.  Others  uttering  tributes 
and  clapping  their  hands  recited  the  monarch's  wonderful  deeds. 
The  birds  in  the  trees  near  the  palace  and  those  confined  in 
cages  awoke  and  sang.  Their  notes  mingled  with  the  salutations 
of  the  brahmins,  the  music  of  the  vinas,  the  chanting  of  the  holy 
names  of  God  and  the  praises  of  those  describing  the  great  deeds 
of  the  king.  Eunuchs  and  servants  stood  near,  ready  to  serve, 
as  was  their  wont.  Those  who  attended  to  the  ablutions  of 
the  king,  brought  water  scented  with  fragrant  perfumes,  in 
pitchers  of  gold.  Charming  and  well-attired  men  and  women 
came  with  oil,  unguents,  mirrors,  combs,  towels  and  other 
articles  and  all  that  was  needed  by  the  king  was  provided 
according  to  custom.  Till  sunrise,  all  awaited  the  king,  then 
they  addressed  each  other  saying :  "  How  is  this,  has  his  majesty 
not  yet  risen  ?  w  Then  the  women,  other  than  Kaushalya,  who 
formerly  attended  on  the  king,  began  to  waken  their  lord  as  was 
their  usage.  Having  with  affection  and  skill  touched  the  body 
of  the  monarch,  they  found  no  sign  of  life  in  him.  Then  the 
women,  knowing  well  the  motion  of  the  pulse  and  understanding 
the  signs  of  sleep,  began  to  tremble  perceiving  the  king's 
condition.  Fearing  that  the  king  no  longer  breathed,  they  shook 
like  the  narcal1  grass  in  the  midst  of  a  flowing  stream,  and  slowly 
became  aware  that  their  sovereign  had  passed  away. 

The  Queens,  Kaushalya  and  Sumitra,  overcome  with  grief 
on  account  of  the  departure  of  their  sons,  lay  as  if  dead.  Suffering 
had  rendered  the  chief  queen  pale  and  her  body  feeble.  The 
two  queens,  their  splendour  dimmed  by  sorrow,  resembled  the 
stars  hidden  by  clouds.

AYODHYA    KANDA 

Seeing  the  two  queens  lying  insensible  and  the  king  dead, 
the  women  wept  aloud  in  distress. 

At  the  loud  wailing  of  the  attendant  women,  like  female 
elephants  bereft  of  their  leader,  Kaushalya  and  Sumitra  came 
to  themselves.  Touching  the  body  of  the  king  and  finding  it 
cold,  they  fell  senseless,  crying :  "  O,  My  Lord,"  "  O,  My 
Lord."  Lying  on  the  earth,  covered  with  dust,  Queen  Kaushalya 
resembled  a  star  fallen  from  the  skies. 

The  king  being  dead,  the  ladies  of  the  inner  apartments  beheld 
the  queen  lying  on  the  ground  like  a  female  naga.1  The  other 
consorts  of  the  king  with  Kaikeyi,  overcome  with  grief,  fell 
unconscious  to  the  earth. 

The  wailing  of  the  women  within,  and  those  who  now  followed 
them,  filled  the  whole  place.  The  royal  dwelling,  bereft  of  joy 
and  filled  with  the  sound  of  distress,  was  thronged  with  afflicted 
relatives  and  friends  mourning  and  weeping.  The  queens 
stricken  with  grief,  lamenting  piteously,  like  orphans  cleaving 
to  their  departed  parent,  clasped  the  arms  of  the  mighty  monarch. 


CHAPTER    66 

The  inhabitants  of  Ayodhya  mourn  for  their  lord 

Kaushalya  placed  the  head  of  the  dead  king,  resembling  an 
extinguished  fire  or  a  waterless  ocean  or  the  sun  without  lustre, 
on  her  lap  and  oppressed  with  grief,  thus  addressed  Kaikeyi : 
"  O  Kaikeyi,  thy  ambition  is  fulfilled,  now  rule  without  further 
opposition.  Having  abandoned  the  king,  enjoy  the  kingdom 
with  thy  son,  O  Thou  of  Evil  Conduct !  Rama  having  departed 
and  the  king  also,  I  resemble  a  traveller  on  a  dangerous  and 
difficult  path  bereft  of  his  companions.  There  is  no  further  joy 
in  life  for  me  1  Alas  !  what  woman  bereft  of  her  lord,  her  deity, 
desires  to  continue  to  live?  Kaikeyi  alone  is  such  a  one, 
having  abandoned  all  virtue.  The  greedy  disregard  the  con- 
sequences of  their  acts,  like  a  hungry  man  devouring  poisonous 

1  Naga— one  of  the  icrpeat  race.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

food  without  considering  its  effects.  Alas !  Kaikeyi  has 
destroyed  the  dynasty  of  Raghu  at  the  instigation  of  a  hunch- 
backed woman !  How  bitterly  will  King  Janaka  mourn,  on 
hearing  that  King  Dasaratha,  urged  by  Kaikeyi,  has  exiled  Rama 
together  with  his  consort.  The  lotus-eyed  Rama,  not  knowing 
the  king  is  dead,  is  unaware  that  I,  to-day,  am  masterless  and 
a  widow  !  The  daughter  of  King  Janaka,  the  wretched  Sita, 
unworthy  of  affliction  will  suffer  intensely  in  the  forest.  Hearing 
the  fearful  roar  of  lions  and  tigers,  in  the  dark  night,  she  will 
cling  in  terror  to  Rama.  The  aged  Janaka,  whose  only  child 
is  Sita,  will  assuredly  die  of  grief,  when  acquainted  with  the 
sufferings  inflicted  on  his  daughter  !  I,  to-day,  in  devotion  to 
my  lord,  will  enter  the  blazing  fire  embracing  his  body." 

Hearing  these  words,  the  chief  minister,  versed  in  the  tradition, 
drew  Queen  Kaushalya  away  from  the  body  of  the  king,  and 
placing  it  in  a  vessel  filled  with  oil,  to  preserve  it,  performed 
the  requisite  ceremonies.  The  counsellors  acquainted  with  the 
time-honoured  duties,  were  unwilling  to  cremate  the  body  of 
the  king  in  the  absence  of  the  prince.  As  the  body  was  lowered 
into  the  oil-filled  vessel,  the  women  of  the  palace  wept  bitterly, 
exclaiming :  "Alas,  the  king  is  dead."  Lifting  up  their  arms, 
shedding  tears  and  wailing  pitiably,  they  cried :  "  O  King, 
having  separated  us  from  the  sweet-speaking  Rama,  why  hast 
thou,  too,  abandoned  us  ?  How  shall  we  live  with  the  evil- 
minded  Kaikeyi,  who  has  exiled  Rama  and  slain  her  lord? 
Alas  !  Shri  Rama,  the  chief  support  of  our  life,  has  gone  to 
the  forest,  relinquishing  his  royal  portion.  How  can  we  live 
under  the  reproaches  and  tyranny  of  Kaikeyi  in  the  absence  of 
Rama  and  of  thee  ?  Will  not  she  who  exiled  Rama,  the  mighty 
Lakshmana  and  Sita  and  abandoned  the  king,  abandon  us  also  ?  " 

Then  the  chief  queens,  the  consorts  of  King  Dasaratha, 
overwhelmed  with  sorrow,  shedding  tears,  felt  themselves  bereft 
of  all  happiness.  like  the  night  without  a  moon  or  a  lovely 
and  youthful  woman  bereft  of  her  lord,  the  city  of  Ayodhya 
appeared  stricken.  Filled  with  men  and  women  weeping  and 
lamenting,  the  city  was  unswept,  its  ways  unadorned !  The 
great  sovereign,  having  through  grief  at  the  separation  from  his 
son,  given  up  his  life,  the  queens  wept  lying  on  the  ground,  till 
the  sun  sank  below  the  horizon  and  the  dark  night  crept  on.

The  friends  and  relatives  of  the  monarch  taking  counsel 
together  being  unwilling  to  cremate  the  body  of  the  king,  in 
the  absence  of  his  son,  laid  it,  therefore,  in  a  vessel  of  oil. 

The  king  being  dead,  the  inhabitants  of  the  city  filled  the 
streets  and  courts,  mourning  for  their  lord,  causing  Ayodhya 
to  resemble  the  night  bereft  of  stars.  Men  and  women  gathered 
together,  inveighing  against  the  mother  of  Bharata,  Queer 
Kaikeyi.    All  were  distraught  and  bereft  of  joy  !

The  elders  recommend  that  a  member  of  the  house  of  Ikshwaku

To  the  inhabitants  of  the  city,  lamenting  and  weeping,  the  night 
was  as  a  high  mountain,  scaled  with  difficulty.  The  sun  having 
risen,  the  brahmin  advisers  to  the  kingdom  came  together  in 
the  royal  assembly,  even  those  illustrious  ones,  Markandeya, 
Vamadeva,  Kasyapa,  Gautama,  Katyayana  and  Javali.  These 
renowned  sages,  together  with  the  ministers,  taking  their  seat 
in  the  presence  of  Vasishtha  the  excellent  and  chief  priest, 
declared  their  mind,  saying :  "  The  past  night  has  been  like 
a  hundred  years  to  us.  Afflicted,  on  account  of  his  son's 
departure,  the  king  has  given  up  his  life.  The  king  is  dead 
and  Shri  Rama  has  entered  the  forest,  together  with  the  mighty 
Lakshmana.  The  Princes  Bharata  and  Shatrughna  are  in  the 
the  capital  of  the  kingdom  of  their  maternal  grandfather.  A 
member  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku  must  be  appointed  king 
lest  the  country  fall  into  ruin.  On  a  kingdom  destitute  of  a 
ruler,  clouds  charged  with  lightning  and  thunder  pour  down 
rain  and  hail !  In  a  rulerless  land,  the  peasants  sow  no  grain ; 
fathers  and  sons  oppose  each  other  and  wives  no  longer  remain 
subject  to  their  husbands !  In  a  rulerless  land,  there  is  no 
peace,  thieves  and  brigands  exercise  their  power;  women, 
unfaithful  to  their  consorts,  leave  their  homes  !  Where  women 
lose  their  virtue,  trust  is  also  lost  In  a  rulerless  land,  there

are  no  assemblies,  nor  do  the  people  visit  pleasant  parks  and 
gardens  or  build  temples  and  homes  of  rest.  In  such  a  land,  the 
self-controlled  brahmins  offer  no  sacrifice  nor  do  those  of  pious 
vows,  assist  them  in  the  sacred  rite.  In  a  rulerless  land,  the 
brahmins  do  not  receive  their  due  share  of  the  sacrificial  fees ; 
neither  do  actors  nor  leaders  of  song  or  dance  find  joy  in  such 
a  land.  The  holy  festivals  promoting  the  land's  prosperity  are 
no  longer  held,  nor  do  those  reciting  the  holy  tradition  give 
satisfaction  to  their  hearers.  In  a  rulerless  land,  virgins  adorned 
with  golden  ornaments,  do  not  frequent  the  flower  gardens  at 
close  of  day,  nor  do  the  devotees  of  pleasure,  riding  swift  chariots 
in  company  with  charming  damsels,  repair  to  the  forest.  In 
such  a  land,  the  wealthy  are  not  protected,  nor  does  the 
husbandman,  the  cowherd  and  the  shepherd  sleep  at  ease  with 
open  doors.  In  a  rulerless  land,  great  elephants  of  sixty  years 
of  age  do  not  wander  on  the  royal  highways  adorned  with 
tinkling  bells.  The  twanging  of  the  archer's  bow  is  no  longer 
heard,  nor  do  the  merchants  travelling  the  roads  in  security 
bring  their  goods  to  sell  from  distant  lands.  In  a  rulerless  land, 
the  self-controlled  sage,  fixing  his  mind,  in  contemplation,  on 
his  identity  with  the  all-pervading  spirit,  receives  no  hospitality 
when  night  falls.  Wealth  is  not  unassailable,  nor  are  man's 
needs  supplied,  the  armies  have  no  leaders,  nor  can  they  match 
the  enemy  in  war.  In  a  rulerless  country,  no  man,  gorgeously 
apparelled,  riding  in  an  excellent  chariot,  drawn  by  swift 
steeds,  can  go  forth  without  fear ;  nor  can  the  learned  disputant 
propound  bis  doctrines  in  the  city  or  forest.  In  such  a  land, 
garlands  and  sweetmeats,  alms  or  other  gifts,  are  not  offered 
by  worshippers  as  a  sacrifice,  nor  in  the  springtime,  do  the 
princes,  like  blossoming  trees,  adorned  with  sandalwood  and 
ambergris,  walk  abroad.  A  kingdom  without  a  sovereign  is  like 
a  river  without  water,  a  forest  without  vegetation,  or  a  cow 
without  a  keeper.  As  a  chariot  is  known  by  its  standard,  as 
a  fire  is  indicated  by  smoke,  so  the  king,  a  light  representing 
the  kingdom,  has  been  extinguished.  No  man  loves  bis  own 
kind  in  a  rulerless  land,  but  each  slays  and  devours  the  other. 
Atheists  and  materialists,  exceeding  the  limits  of  their  caste, 
assume  dominion  over  others,  there  being  no  king  to  exercise 
control  over  them.  As  the  eyes  continuously  point  oat  what 
308 


AYODHYA  KANDA 
is  dangerous  to  the  body,  promoting  its  welfare,  so  the  king 
ever  regards  the  advantage  of  bis  people,  promoting  truth  and 
ethical  conduct.  The  king  leads  his  people  in  the  path  of 
righteousness  and  guides  them  in  integrity,  he  is  the  parent 
of  bis  subjects  and  the  greatest  of  benefactors.  In  the  path 
of  duty  he  excels  even  Yama,  Kuvera,  Indra  and  Varuna.  The 
king,  discerning  good  and  evil,  protects  his  kingdom ;  bereft 
of  him,  the  country  is  enveloped  in  darkness.  O  Holy  Vasishtha, 
while  the  king  lived,  we  obeyed  thy1  mandates  as  the  sea  keeps 
within  its  boundaries.  O  Great  Brahmin,  consider  our  words 
and  the  danger  threatening  this,  our  kingdom,  and  appoint 
someone  as  king  if  he  be  of  the  house  of  Ikshwaku." 


CHAPTER    68 

Messengers  are  sent  to  Prince  Bharata 

Shri  Vasishtha,  having  heard  the  pronouncement  of  the 
ministers  and  brahmins,  said :  "  The  king  has  bequeathed  the 
kingdom  to  Bharata,  who,  with  his  brother  abides  happily  in 
the  house  of  his  maternal  uncle,  therefore,  dispatch  swift 
messengers  speedily,  to  bring  back  the  two  princes.  This  and 
naught  else  should  be  done." 

Then  all  said:  "  Be  it  so,  O  Lord." 

Vasishtha  then  said  to  Siddartha,  Vijaya,  Jayanta,  Asoka  and 
Nandana  :a  "  Come  hither  and  attend  to  what  I  command  you 
to  do :  On  swift  steeds  set  out  for  the  city  of  Rajagraha  and, 
concealing  all  signs  of  grief,  thus  address  Prince  Bharata  :'  The 
holy  priest  Shri  Vasishtha  and  his  counsellors  salute  thee  and 
inform  thee  that  an  urgent  matter  awaits  thy  attention  in 
the  capital  \" 

"  Have  a  care  not  to  disclose  to  him  the  fall  of  the  Raghu 
dynasty  nor  speak  of  Rama's  exile  or  the  king's  death.  Take 
with  you  silken  robes  and  excellent  gems  for  the  King  of  Kaikeya 
and  for  Prince  Bharata,  and  depart  without  delay."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

The  messengers  received  the  commands  of  Shri  Vasishtha 
and  taking  provision  for  the  journey  went  to  their  own  houses. 
Then  mounting  swift  horses,  accustomed  to  prolonged  travel, 
they  started  for  the  kingdom  of  Kaikeya.  Having  taken  leave 
of  the  holy  Guru,  equipped  with  provisions,  they  departed  in 
haste.  Their  course,  along  the  bank  of  the  Malini,  lay  south 
between  the  Uparathala  mountain  and  north  of  Pralamba. 
They  crossed  the  sacred  Ganges  at  Hastinapura  and  proceeded 
westward  arriving  in  Panchala  (the  Punjab)  by  way  of  Kuru 
Jangula.  On  the  way,  they  beheld  many  lakes  filled  with  limpid 
water  and  translucent  streams  and  passing  speedily  onwards, 
reached  the  river  Sharadanda,  full  of  pure  water  and  frequented 
by  many  species  of  waterfowl. 

On  the  bank  of  that  river  grew  the  sacred  tree  Satyapayachan, 
to  which  the  messengers  made  obeisance  and  then  entered  the 
city  of  Kalinga.  Passing  through  the  village  of  Abikala,  they 
crossed  the  river  Ikshumati  issuing  from  the  mountain  Bodhi- 
bhavana,  a  territory  formerly  belonging  to  the  House  of  Ikshwaku. 
There  the  messengers  drank  the  water  of  the  river  from  the  palms 
of  their  hands  and  encountered  certain  brahmins  versed  in  the 
Veda. 

Traversing  the  land  of  Vahlika,  they  descried  the  mountain 
Sudamana  which  bore  the  marks  of  the  Feet  of  Vishnu,  and 
duly  worshipped  it.  They  beheld  the  rivers  Vipasha  and 
Shalmali  and  many  pools,  lakes  and  reservoirs.  Proceeding 
further  on  their  journey,  according  to  the  instructions  of  their 
master,  they  saw  lions,  tigers,  elephants  and  various  other  beasts. 

After  a  long  period,  the  horses  became  fatigued,  but  the 
messengers  pressed  on  to  the  town  of  Giribraja  in  the  kingdom 
of  Kaikeya.  For  the  sake  of  performing  the  will  of  their  lord 
and  to  preserve  the  royal  dynasty  and  the  honour  of  the  House 
of  Dasaratha,  without  relaxing  their  pace,  the  messengers  entered 
the  city  at  nightfall.

CHAPTER     69 

Prince  Bkarata's  inauspicious  dream 

On  the  night  the  messengers  reached  the  city,  Prince  Bharata 
had  a  most  inauspicious  dream.  Seeing  that  evil  dream,  the 
son  of  the  emperor,  when  the  night  ended,  was  much  distressed. 
His  intimate  friends,  the  companions  of  his  own  age,  seeing 
him  in  distress,  spoke  pleasing  words  in  the  assembly  and  related 
humorous  traditions  to  distract  his  mind.  Some  played  on  vinas 
for  his  entertainment,  others  danced,  acted  and  narrated  stories. 

Despite  the  endeavours  of  his  amiable  companions,  Prince 
Bharata  remained  melancholy.  At  length,  they  addressed  him, 
saying :  "  O  Friend,  we  have  tried  in  vain  to  entertain  thee, 
why  dost  thou  not  smile  ?  " 

Bharata  replied :  "  Hear  the  cause  of  my  sadness.  In  a  dream, 
I  saw  my  father  in  faded  apparel,  his  hair  dishevelled,  falling 
from  a  mountain  peak  into  a  pit  of  cow  dung.  There,  I  saw 
that  great  king,  wallowing  like  a  frog  and  drinking  oil  from 
the  palms  of  his  hands  ;  afterwards,  I  beheld  him  eating  rice 
mixed  with  sesamum  seed,  his  body  besmeared  with  oil,  he 
being  immersed  in  it.  Again,  in  that  dream,  I  saw  the  sea 
dry  up  and  the  moon  fall  on  the  earth  and  the  world  plunged 
in  darkness.  The  tusks  of  the  royal  elephants  were  broken 
in  pieces  and  a  blazing  fire  was  suddenly  extinguished.  I  saw 
the  earth  rent  and  the  leaves  of  the  trees  wither  and  the 
mountains  riven  and  emit  smoke.  I  beheld  the  king  on  an 
iron  seat,  clad  in  black  and  women  attired  in  black  and  yellow 
mocking  him.  That  virtuous  king,  adorned  with  sandalwood 
paste,  wearing  garlands  of  red  Sowers,  seated  in  a  chariot  drawn 
by  asses  went  southwards.  I  saw  a  female  demon  of  monstrous 
shape  clothed  in  red  deriding  the  king.  This  fearful  vision 
has  been  seen  by  me.  Either  myself  or  Rama  or  the  king  or 
Lakshmana  will  surely  die.  When,  in  a  dream,  one  is  seen 
riding  in  a  chariot  drawn  by  asses,  the  smoke  of  his  funeral  pyre 
will  soon  ascend.  On  this  account,  I  am  distraught,  nought 
gives  me  joy,  my  throat  is  choked  and  my  mind  confused. 
I  see  no  reason  for  fear,  yet  I  am  apprehensive.  I  cannot  speak 
311 


THE    RAMAYAKA    OF    VALMIKI 

or  breathe,  my  body  has  lost  its  power,  I  am  agitated  and  cannot 
control  my  distress.  Never  have  I  seen  so  threatening  a  dream ! 
Reflecting  on  it,  I  am  perturbed,  fear  has  taken  possession  of 
my  heart  and  I  know  not  if  I  shall  ever  again  behold  the  king." 


CHAPTER    70 

The  message  is  delivered;  Bharata  and  Shatrughna  leave 
the  palace 

While  Bharata  was  relating  his  dream,  the  messengers  from 
Ayodhya,  overcome  with  weariness,  entered  the  city  of  Raja- 
grahapura  within  the  impassable  moat. 

Having  approached  the  King  of  Kaikeya  and  the  heir-apparent, 
Prince  Yudhajita,  and  being  received  by  them  with  due  hospital- 
ity, they  addressed  Prince  Bharata  saying  :  "  The  chief  priest, 
Shri  Vasishtha  and  his  counsellors  send  their  greetings  !  Return 
speedily  to  Ayodhya,  an  urgent  matter  awaits  thy  attention  there. 
O  Great  Prince,  taking  these  precious  robes  and  jewelled 
ornaments  sent  to  thee,  present  them  to  thy  maternal  uncle." 

Shri  Bharata,  accepting  the  gifts  offered  them  to  his  maternal 
uncle  with  great  affection,  then  making  provision  for  the 
messengers  and  entertaining  them  duly,  he  afterwards  said  to 
them :  "  O  Messengers,  is  my  father  the  king  well  ?  Is  the 
great  Ramachandra  well,  and  my  brother  Prince  Lakshmana  ? 
Is  the  Queen  Kaushalya,  the  upholder  of  dharma,  in  good  health  ? 
She  who  is  virtuous  and  a  patron  of  brahmins,  who  is  ever 
to  be  worshipped,  who  is  wise  and  the  chief  queen  ?  Is  the 
second  of  my  father's  queens,  Sumitra  the  mother  of  Lakshmana 
and  Shatrughna,  well  ?  And  my  mother  Kaikeyi,  self-willed, 
given  to  anger,  arrogant  and  accounting  herself  wise,  is  it  well 
with  her  ?    What  message  has  she  sent  tome?" 

The  messengers  thus  addressed  by  Prince  Bharata,  answered 
with  respect :  "  O  Lion  among  Men,  those  whose  welfare  is  dear 
to  thee,  are  well.  Prosperity  awaits  thee,  therefore,  summon 
thy  chariot" 

312 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

Prince  Bharata  said :  "  I  will  seek  permission  of  the  king 
to  depart  and  inform  him  I  must  go  without  delay.'* 

Thus,  dismissing  the  messengers,  Prince  Bharata  approached 
his  grandfather  and  said :  "  Your  Majesty,  urged  by  the 
messengers,  I  wish  to  return  to  my  father  in  haste,  I  will  come 
again,  when  thou  art  pleased  to  call  me." 

King  Kaikeya  smelling  the  head  of  the  prince,  addressed  him 
in  comfortable  words,  saying :  "  O  Bharata,  Kaikeyi  is  blessed 
in  thee,  a  virtuous  son!  Carry  my  greetings  to  thy  mother 
and  father.  Salute  also  the  holy  Sage  Vasishtha,  and  the  wise 
and  pious  brahmins  in  my  name  and  greet  the  mighty  warriors 
Rama  and  Lakshmana." 

King  Kaikeya,  then,  bidding  Bharata  farewell,  commending 
him,  gave  him  great  elephants  and  precious  shawls,  woollen 
cloths  and  deerskins.  He  gave  him  also  with  great  venera- 
tion, much  wealth,  two  thousand  necklaces,  coral  and  gold 
ornaments  and  sixteen  hundred  excellent  horses.  He  sent  also 
wise  and  trustworthy  counsellors  to  attend  him.  Then  Prince 
Yudhajita  gave  Bharata  two  stately  elephants  named  Iravata  and 
Indrasihra  and  many  mules  to  transport  his  gifts.  His  uncle 
gave  him  also  certain  tierce  dogs,  bred  in  the  palace  with  large 
teeth  equalling  tigers  in  strength. 

Shri  Bharata  praised  the  gifts  conferred  on  him  and  sought 
permission  to  leave  without  delay.  His  heart  was  heavy  on 
account  of  his  fearful  dream  and  the  urgency  of  the  messengers. 

The  prince  came  forth  from  the  inner  apartments  of  the  palace 
and,  surrounded  by  elephants  and  horses,  stood  on  the  royal 
highway.  Entering  the  king's  apartment,  unchallenged,  Shri 
Bharata  bade  farewell  to  all,  then  mounting  his  chariot  with 
Prince  Shatrughna,  he  started  on  his  journey.  Servants,  horses, 
camels,  bulls  and  mules  followed  the  chariot  of  the  prince. 
Escorted  by  the  private  counsellors  of  the  king,  together  with 
the  army,  the  patient  and  highly  valiant  Bharata  together 
with  Shatrughna  left  the  palace  fearlessly,  as  the  perfected  ones 
leave  the  region  of  Indra.

CHAPTER    71 

Prince  Bharata  sees  Ayodhya  fitted  with  unhappy  people 

That  valiant  and  resplendent  prince,  turning  eastward,  came 
to  the  river  Suddama,  and  passing  over  it,  reached  the  broad 
Hladini  and  the  Satali  Sowing  westward.  Having  crossed  over 
the  river  at  Hadhana,  he  reached  Parvata  and  the  stream  in  which 
all  objects  thrown  are  petrified,  then  proceeding  further  he 
forded  the  Shalyakartana  river.  Then  the  righteous  and  truth 
loving  prince  ascended  the  mountains  and  crossed  the  river 
Shilavaha  near  the  forest  Chitraratha,  arriving  at  the  confluence 
of  the  Ganges  and  Saraswati,  and  traversing  the  land  of 
Viramatsya,  entered  the  Bharunda  forest.  At  length,  reaching 
the  swift  and  joy-inspiring  Kulinga  river,  which  descends  from 
the  mountains,  he  crossed  the  Yamuna  and  allowed  his  army 
to  rest.  There,  the  weary  horses  were  refreshed  and  his 
followers  bathed  and  drank,  taking  water  with  them  for  future 
use  on  the  way.  Thereafter,  Prince  Bharata  entered  the 
uninhabited  forest  on  a  great  Bhadra  elephant,  speedily  travers- 
ing it.  Finding  they  were  unable  to  cross  the  Gunga  at 
Unchudhana,  they  went  to  the  place  called  Pragavata  and 
crossing  there  passed  over  another  river  named  Kutikoshtaka ; 
then  with  his  army,  he  reached  the  village  of  Dharmavardhana. 
Resting  for  a  while  at  Varutha,  the  son  of  Dasaratha  went  towards 
the  east  to  the  wood  called  Ujjihana  which  was  filled  with 
kedumbra1  trees.  Arriving  at  the  groves  of  sala2  and  bhanduka3 
trees,  Bharata,  leaving  his  army  to  follow  slowly,  went  forward 
with  haste,  halting  at  the  village  of  Sarvatirtha.  Then  crossing 
the  river  Uttamika,  he  passed  over  several  other  streams  with 
the  help  of  mountain  ponies.  At  Hastiprastaka,  he  crossed  the 
river  Kutika  and  at  Lohitya,  the  Sukatavati.  Arriving  at  the 
forest  of  Sahavana,  having  crossed  the  Sthanumati  near  Eksala, 
he  traversed  the  Gaumati  at  Vinata.  His  horses  being  greatly 
fatigued  by  the  journey,  the  prince  halted  the  night  at  Salawan 
and  at  dawn  beheld  Ayodhya.

Having  spent  seven  nights  on  the  way,  seeing  Ayodhya  from 
a  distance,  the  prince  said  to  his  charioteer :  "  O  Charioteer, 
this  would  appear  to  be  the  renowned  and  taintless  city  of 
Ayodhya  abounding  in  green  lawns,  but  at  a  distance  it  resembles 
a  heap  of  yellow  dust ;  formerly  the  sound  of  the  recitation  of 
the  Veda  was  heard,  intoned  by  the  brahmins,  and  the  city  was 
Frequented  by  royal  sages.  To-day,  I  do  not  hear  the  cheerful 
cries  of  men  and  women  in  pursuit  of  pleasure  !  The  woods 
at  eventide  were  formerly  filled  with  people,  running  here  and 
there  in  sport,  but  to-day  they  are  deserted  and  silent.  O 
Charioteer,  this  is  not  like  Ayodhya  to  me,  but  seems  to  be  a 
wilderness.  None  of  the  nobly  born  are  seen  coming  and  going 
in  chariots  or  riding  on  elephants  and  horses.  The  flower 
gardens  were  erstwhile  filled  with  cheerful  people  and  the 
orchards  with  those  who  made  merry  there  !  These  gardens, 
once  abounding  in  flowers  and  trees,  with  pleasant  groves  and 
arbours,  to-day  seem  to  mourn.  I  no  longer  hear  the  cry  of  deer 
or  the  birds  singing  with  joy.  O  Friend,  why  do  the  breezes, 
redolent  with  the  scent  of  sandalwood  and  ambergris,  not  blow 
as  formerly,  over  the  city  ?  In  the  past,  the  sound  of  drums 
and  the  music  of  the  Vina  was  heard  by  us,  now  all  is  silent ! 
I  see  portentous  signs  and  evil  omens,  my  mind  is  heavy  on 
account  of  these  forebodings.  O  Charioteer,  without  apparent 
cause  my  heart  beats  fast  and  painfully,  my  mind  is  clouded, 
and  apprehension  freezes  my  senses." 

Entering  the  capital  by  the  northern  gate,  his  horses  being 
overcome  with  weariness,  the  guards,  enquiring  as  to  his  welfare, 
sought  to  accompany  him  on  his  way.  But  Bharata,  sick  at 
heart,  declined  their  company,  though  with  due  deference. 

He  said  :  "  O  Charioteer,  I  behold  the  houses  with  their  doors 
set  open,  bereft  of  splendour  and  emitting  no  fragrance  of  incense 
or  sacrificial  offering  !  Filled  with  unhappy  people  and  those 
who  are  fasting,  the  houses  are  destitute  of  all  splendour.  No 
garlands  hang  from  any  dwelling  and  the  courtyards  lie  neglected 
and  unswept.  The  temples,  without  attendant  priests,  have 
lost  their  former  splendour,  none  worship  the  gods  and  the 
sacrificial  pavilions  are  deserted.  The  shops  where  formerly 
flowers  were  sold  and  other  merchandise,  are  neglected,  and  the 
merchants  appear  dispirited  and  anxious  over  the  cessation  of  their 

3*5 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

trade.  Birds  in  the  sacred  groves  seem  joyless  and  men  and 
women  in  soiled  attire,  weeping  and  lamenting,  wasted  with  grief, 
roam  about  the  city." 

Speaking  thus  to  the  charioteer  and  seeing  the  city's  distress, 
Prince  Bharata  drove  towards  the  palace.  Beholding  the  capital 
once  gay  as  Indra's  city,  with  the  roads  and  courts  deserted 
and  the  houses  covered  with  dust,  he  was  overcome  with  anguish. 
Struck  by  these  painful  portents  formerly  unknown  to  him, 
Bharata,  with  bowed  head,  his  heart  filled  with  dread,  entered 
his  father's  palace. 


CHAPTER    72 

Queen  Kaikeyi  begins  to  relate  what  has  occurred 

Not  seeing  his  father  in  the  palace,  Bharata,  desirous  of 
beholding  his  mother,  went  to  her  apartment.  Kaikeyi,  seeing 
her  son  after  a  long  absence,  with  a  joyous  heart,  rose  from 
her  golden  couch.  Observing  the  apartment  of  his  mother, 
divested  of  splendour,  Bharata  reverently  touched  her  feet. 
She,  having  kissed  the  head  of  her  son,  embracing  him  again, 
seated  him  on  her  lap,  and  said :  **  O  Child !  How  many  days 
have  passed  since  thou  didst  leave  thy  grandfather's  abode  ? 
Having  journeyed  in  haste,  I  trust  thou  art  not  fatigued  ?  O 
Child,  are  thy  grandfather  and  uncle  well  ?  Tell  me,  O  Dear 
One,  hast  thou  been  in  health  since  thou  hast  visited  that  other 
country  ?  " 

Shri  Bharata  thus  questioned,  by  his  mother,  related  all  that 
had  happened.  He  said :  "  0  Mother,  seven  days  and  seven 
nights  have  passed,  since  I  left  my  grandfather's  home.  Both 
he  and  my  uncle  are  well.  The  parting  gifts  of  wealth  and  gems 
which  the  King  of  Kaikeya  gave  me,  I  have  left  on  the  way, 
to  follow  me,  the  beasts  of  burden  being  weary !  The 
messengers  who  conveyed  the  orders  of  the  king,  bade  me  return 
with  all  speed.  Now,  O  Mother,  answer  what  I  would  feign 
ask  ?  Why  is  this,  thy  golden  couch,  vacated  by  the  king  ? 
3J6 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

'Why  do  the  king's  subjects  appear  wretched  ?  The  king  was 
wont  to  dwell  principally  in  thy  palace,  where  is  he  to-day  ? 
I  have  come  hither  to  enter  his  august  presence !  Where  is 
my  father  now,  I  have  come  to  offer  salutations  to  his  feet  ? 
Is  he  in  the  apartment  of  my  chief  mother,  Queen  Kaushalya  ?  " 
Kaikeyi,  knowing  all  that  had  taken  place  but  filled  with 
ambition,  answered  Prince  Bharata,  as  yet  ignorant  of  the  matter. 
Imparting  the  unpleasant  news  in  honeyed  accents,  she  said : 
"  That  fate,  which  inevitably  overtakes  all  beings,  has  befallen 
that  great  soul,  that  renowned  and  mighty  monarch  the  support 
of  his  people,  thy  sire  !  " 

The  guileless  Prince  Bharata,  born  of  a  great  family,  hearing 
these  words,  overwhelmed  by  grief,  instantly  fell  to  the  ground 
and  falling  striking  his  hands  on  the  earth,  cried  :  "Alas !  I 
am  undone ! "  That  resplendent  prince,  deeply  moved  on 
learning  of  the  death  of  his  father,  began  to  lament,  crying : 
"  On  this  couch,  my  father  appeared  like  the  moon  in  autumn, 
to-day  on  account  of  his  absence,  this  pleasant  bed  resembles 
the  sky  bereft  of  stars  or  the  ocean  without  water !  " 

Heaving  deep  sighs,  weeping  bitterly  and  covering  his  face 
with  a  cloth,  the  prince  continued  to  mourn. 

Queen  Kaikeyi,  seeing  Bharata  lying  on  the  ground,  over- 
whelmed with  sorrow,  like  the  branch  of  a  shala  tree,  severed 
by  the  blows  of  an  axe,  raised  him  up  and  said  to  her  godlike  son 
who  resembled  the  moon,  the  sun  or  the  elephant  in  splendour : 
"  O  Son  of  a  King !  O  Most  Illustrious  One !  Rise  !  Rise ! 
Pious  men  like  thee,  do  not  thus  yield  to  grief!  O  Wise  One  1 
As  the  radiance  of  the  sun  "is  fixed  in  that  orb,  so  must  thou 
who  art  devoted  to  charity,  sacrifice  and  good  conduct  and  who 
follow  the  injunctions  of  the  Vedas,  be  calm  !  " 

Prince  Bharata,  rolling  on  the  earth,  wept  for  a  long  time 
and  then  answered  his  mother  sorrowfully,  saying :  "  O  Mother, 
thinking  the  king  was  undertaking  a  great  sacrifice,  having 
bestowed  the  throne  on  Shri  Rama,  I  started  for  home  with 
great  joy,  but  now  I  see  matters  are  otherwise  and  my  mind 
is  torn  with  anguish,  since  I  no  longer  behold  my  ever 
magnanimous  parent  I  O  Mother,  from  what  malady  did  the 
king  suffer,  that  he  was  carried  away  in  my  absence  ?  How 
fortunate  are  my  brothers,  Shri  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  who 
3i7 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

have  performed  the  monarch's  obsequies  !  If  the  great  sovereign' 
had  been  aware  of  my  return,  would  he  not  have  bent  his  head 
and  embraced  me  ?  Alas  !  Where  is  that  royal  hand,  the  touch 
of  which  filled  me  with  delight  and  which  cleansed  my  body 
from  the  dust  ?  O  Mother,  where  is  my  sagacious  brother  Rama, 
whose  servant  I  am  and  who  resembles  my  father  ?  Tell  me 
quickly  where  he  may  be  found?  Since  my  virtuous  and 
enlightened  brother  has  now  become  as  a  rather  to  me,  I  desire 
to  take  refuge  at  his  feet,  he  alone  is  my  sole  support !  O 
Mother,  what  commands  concerning  me  did  the  righteous  and 
learned  king,  the  ever-tnithful  monarch  of  firm  vows,  give  ? 
I  desire  to  hear  the  last  words  of  the  great  sovereign  ?  " 

Thus  questioned,  Queen  Kaikeyi  openly  answered,  saying : 
"  The  king,  at  the  time  of  death,  did  not  speak  thy  name 
but  cried  '  O  Rama,  O  Sita,  O  Lakshmana '  and  thus  gave  up  his 
life  !  Thy  father,  bound  by  the  ties  of  fate  and  duty,  like  a 
mighty  elephant,  caught  in  ambush,  uttered  these  words  at  the 
end :  '  Those  who  see  Rama,  Sita  and  Lakshmana,  returning 
from  the  forest,  will  attain  their  desire  V 

As  Kaikeyi  revealed  this  unpleasant  intelligence,  the  prince 
grew  yet  more  distracted  and  enquired  of  his  mother :  *'  O 
Mother,  where  is  the  virtuous  Rama,  where  is  he  now  with  Sita 
and  his  brother  Lakshmana  ?  " 

Thus  questioned,  the  queen  began  to  relate  what  had  occurred, 
supposing  the  news  of  the  unpleasing  event  would  be  welcome 
to  her  son. 

She  said :  "  O  Child,  that  prince,  clothed  in  robes  of  bark, 
has  entered  the  great  Dandaka  forest  with  Sita  and  Lakshmana." 

Hearing  from  his  mother  that  Rama  had  entered  the  forest, 
Prince  Bharata  was  alarmed,  filled  with  misgivings  and  concerned 
for  the  honour  of  his  House.  He  said  :  '*  O  Mother,  how  is 
this  ?  Has  Shri  Rama,  without  reason,  slain  any,  either  rich 
or  poor  ?  Or  has  he  looked  on  the  wife  of  another  with  desire  ? 
For  what  reason  has  Rama,  versed  in  the  scriptures,  been  exiled 
to  the  forest  ?  " 

Then  the  mother  of  Bharata,  imbued  with  feminine  qualities, 

capricious  and  calculating,  began  to  relate  the  whole  matter. 

Hearing  her  son's  words,  Kaikeyi,  gratified,  vainly  imagining 

herself  wise,  said  :  "  My  Son,  neither  has  Rama  robbed  a 

318 


AYODHYA  KANDA 
brahmin  of  his  wealth,  nor  has  he  slain  any,  rich  or  poor, 
without  reason,  neither  has  Rama  looked  on  another's  wife 
with  desire  !  My  Son,  having  heard  that  he  was  to  be  proclaimed 
regent,  I  requested  thy  father  to  banish  Rama  and  bestow  the 
kingdom  on  thee !  Thy  sire,  in  order  to  honour  the  promise 
made  to  me,  fulfilled  my  request.  He  sent  Rama,  together  with 
Sita  and  Lakshmana  to  the  forest.  Then  that  mighty  monarch, 
unable  to  endure  the  separation  from  his  son,  died.  O  Righteous 
Prince,  now  do  thou  rule  the  kingdom  !  For  thy  sake,  I  have 
contrived  all  this !  My  Son,  do  not  grieve,  do  not  afflict  thyself, 
the  kingdom  and  the  capital,  being  now  without  a  ruler,  depend 
on  thee  for  support.  Therefore,  seeking  advice  from  Shri 
Vasishtha  and  the  learned  brahmins,  perform  the  funeral  rites 
of  thy  great  sire  and,  without  hesitation,  accept  the  throne ! " 


chapter   73 

Prince  Bharata  reproaches  his  mother 

Hearing  of  the  death  of  his  father  and  the  exile  of  his  brothers, 
Prince  Bharata,  deeply  afflicted,  answered  Queen  Kaikeyi : 
"  What  will  the  throne  avail  me,  since  I  am  stricken  by  the  death 
of  my  father  and  bereft  of  my  brother,  who  was  as  a  parent 
to  me  ?  Thou  hast  destroyed  the  king,  and  banished  Rama, 
causing  him  to  become  an  ascetic !  Thou  hast  thus  rubbed  salt 
into  the  wounds  which  thou  hast  inflicted  !  Thou  hast  entered 
this  royal  House  for  its  extinction,  like  the  night  of  death ! 
My  father,  unaware  that  thou  wert  an  all-consuming  fire, 
supported  thee.  O  Sinful  One,  thou  hast  deprived  the  king 
of  life !  O  Thou  Destroyer  of  the  Family,  overpowered  with 
avarice,  thou  hast  shattered  the  peace  of  the  hearth.  Through 
union  with  thee,  my  father,  a  lover  of  truth,  has  suffered  untold 
misery  and  grief !  Wherefore  hast  thou  slain  my  virtuous  sire  ? 
Wherefore  hast  thou  exiled  Rama  ?  Hard  indeed  were  it  to  live 
with  such  a  mother !  How  will  Kaushalya  and  Sumitra  now 
endure  life?  My  elder  brother,  Shri  Ramachandra,  ever 
devoted  to  his  duty  and  to  the  service  of  his  Guru,  treated  thee 

310  T 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

as  his  own  mother.  So  also  my  elder  mother,  Queen  Kaushalya, 
knowing  what  would  befall,  yet  acted  towards  thee  as  a  true 
sister,  in  a  proper  spirit.  Thou  hast  sent  her  son  to  the  forest 
in  ascetic's  garb  and  still  thou  dost  not  grieve  ?  What  hast 
thou  gained  by  sending  that  renowned  hero,  Rama,  to  the  forest, 
Rama,  who  was  unacquainted  with  suffering  ?  Wert  thou 
ignorant  of  my  great  love  for  Raghava,  that  thou,  possessed  by 
avarice,  committed  this  great  sin,  O  Mother  ?  By  what  power 
can  I  rule,  deprived  of  Lakshmana  and  that  Lion  among  men, 
Shri  Rama  ?  King  Dasaratha  ever  depended  on  that  mighty 
and  valorous  Rama,  as  the  forest  depends  on  Mount  Meru ! 
How  can  I  sustain  the  burden  of  the  kingdom,  without  the 
support  of  Rama  ?  How  should  a  calf  sustain  the  load  that  taxes 
the  strength  of  a  full-grown  bull  ?  Even  if  it  were  possible 
for  me  to  rule  through  wisdom  and  sound  policy,  yet  would  I 
not  allow  thy  evil  intention  in  seeking  the  kingdom  for  thy  son, 
to  prevail !  I  should  have  abandoned  thee,  O  Mother,  did  I 
not  know  that  Rama  regards  thee  as  his  mother  also  !  O  Thou 
Evil-minded  One,  thou  hast  brought  disgrace  on  the  dynasty 
of  my  ancestors !  How  didst  thou  conceive  such  a  purpose, 
bringing  shame  into  our  lives  ?  It  is  the  immemorial  custom 
of  our  House,  that  the  eldest  brother  shall  occupy  the  throne 
and  the  younger  brothers  obey  him.  Thou  art  not  acquainted 
with  the  duty  of  a  king  nor  dost  thou  know  the  rules  of 
government.  In  the  House  of  Ikshwaku,  the  succession  of  the 
eldest  son  is  enjoined.  To-day,  thou  hast  cast  into  the  dust 
the  glory  and  integrity  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku,  that  was 
enriched  by  the  noble  conduct  of  its  kings  !  Thou,  too,  wert 
born  of  a  renowned  and  royal  House,  how  earnest  thou  to 
entertain  this  evil  intention  ?  O  Mother,  let  it  be  known  to  thee 
that  I  will  never  fulfil  thy  evil  desires,  come  what  may,  since 
thou  hast  introduced  that  which  is  destructive  of  life  into  this 
royal  House !  I  shall  now  bring  my  sinless  brother,  Rama, 
back  to  the  capital  and  thwart  thee !  Not  only  will  I  cause  Rama 
to  return  from  the  forest,  but  I  will  serve  him  with  my  whole 
heart!" 

Thus  reproaching  Kaikeyi,  himself  afflicted,  with  harsh  words, 
Bharata  spoke  once  more,  roaring  like  a  lion  in  the  caves  of 
the  Mandara  mountain.

CHAPTER    74 

He  laments  the  death  of  his  father  and  the  exile  of  Shri  Rama 

Shri  Bharata  denounced  his  mother  in  great  anger,  saying : — 

"  O  Cruel-hearted  One,  O  Wicked  Being,  thou  art  without  virtue, 
enter  the  forest,  I  am  about  to  die !  Weep  for  me ;  since  thou 
hast  deserted  thy  consort,  do  not  mourn  for  him.  Tell  me, 
what  harm  had  the  king  or  the  most  virtuous  Rama  done 
to  thee,  that  thou  hast  slain  the  one  and  exiled  the  other  ?  O 
Kaikeyi,  the  sin  by  which  thou  hast  destroyed  the  dynasty 
is  equal  to  the  murder  of  a  brahmin !  Do  thou  enter  hell ! 
Thou  hast  no  right  to  inhabit  the  region  to  which  the  king 
has  gone !  Thy  deed  and  guilt  are  infamous.  In  denouncing 
Rama,  who  is  beloved  of  all  the  world,  thou  hast  secured  me 
a  kingdom,  but  brought  me  ignominy.  Thou  art  the  cause 
of  my  father's  death  and  the  exile  of  Rama,  and  also  of  my 
dishonour.  Thy  heart  is  adamant,  thou  art  not  my  mother 
but  an  enemy  in  the  form  of  a  mother !  O  Slayer  of  thy 
husband,  thou  dost  not  merit  that  one  should  address  thee ! 
O  Defamer  of  the  fair  name  of  this  dynasty,  thou  art  the  cause 
of  distress  to  my  mothers,  Queen  Kaushalya  and  Sumitra ! 
Thou  hast  forfeited  the  title  of  daughter  to  the  great  King 
Ashwapati ;  thou  art  surety  a  demon  born  in  that  family  to 
destroy  my  father's  line !  Thou  hast  banished  Rama  to  the 
forest,  he,  who  ever  delighted  in  virtue  and  thou  hast  deprived 
my  illustrious  father  of  his  life !  It  is  I  who  must  bear  the 
weight  of  thine  iniquity,  who  am  fatherless,  bereft  of  my  two 
brothers  and  an  object  of  universal  loathing  !  O  Thou  Sinner, 
O  Traveller  on  the  path  of  self-destruction,  say  what  state  shalt 
thou  attain,  who  hast  deprived  the  virtuous  Kaushalya  of  her 
husband  and  her  son  ?  O  Evil  One,  didst  thou  not  know  that 
Shri  Rama  was  the  chief  asylum  of  his  relatives,  the  son  of 
Kaushalya  and  a  father  to  me  ?  All  relatives  are  dear,  but  to 
a  mother,  the  son  is  dearest,  since  he  is  born  of  the  body  and 
heart  of  the  father.  Hast  thou  forgotten  this  truth  ?  " 
In  ancient  times,  the  cow  Kamadhenu,  worshipped  by  the 
3« 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

gods,  beholding  two  of  her  sons,  weary  with  ploughing,  swooned 
away.  At  that  time,  the  King  of  the  Celestials,  Indra,  was 
wandering  on  the  earth  and  the  fragrant  tears  of  Kamadhenu 
fell  upon  him.  Experiencing  the  sweet  odour  issuing  from  the 
body  of  the  sacred  cow,  Indra  realised  her  superior  worth  and 
startled,  looked  upward  and  beheld,  in  the  sky,  the  afflicted 
Kamadhenu,  weeping  piteously.  The  Bearer  of  the  Mace,1 
distressed  on  seeing  the  renowned  Kamadhenu  shedding  tears, 
addressed  her  with  humility  and  said  :  "  O  Benefactor  of  the 
World,  why  dost  thou  weep  ?  Is  it  the  premonition  of  some 
future  calamity  which  causes  thee  to  lament  thus  ?  " 

The  wise  Kamadhenu,  patiendy  answered :  "  O  Devaraj, 
thou  hast  no  cause  for  fear,  I  am  afflicted  on  account  of  the 
suffering  of  two  of  my  sons.  See,  how  wretched  they  are, 
how  wasted  and  oppressed  by  the  sun's  heat !  O  Devaraj  1 
The  ploughman  has  struck  them  cruelly !  Born  of  my  body, 
I  am  filled  with  grief  to  see  them  yoked  to  the  heavy  plough ! 
Verily  nothing  is  dearer  to  a  mother  than  her  son." 

Indra,  perceiving  that  the  cow  mourned  over  the  wretched 
state  of  two  of  her  innumerable  sons,  recognised  that  to  a  mother 
nothing  is  dearer  than  a  son  ! 

"  O  Mother,  Kamadhenu  extends  her  blessings  equally  to  all 
and  has  the  power  to  fulfil  the  desires  of  others.  If  she,  who 
is  constantly  producing  thousands  of  offspring,  filled  with 
maternal  love,  mourns  thus  for  two  sons,  how  then,  O  Kaikeyi, 
will  Kaushalya  bear  the  exile  of  her  only  son  ?  Thou  hast 
brought  about  the  separation  of  Rama  from  his  mother  Kaushalya 
and  for  this  thou  shalt  not  know  happiness  in  this  or  in  the 
other  world !  I  shall  perform  the  last  rites  for  my  sire  and 
then,  with  my  heart  and  soul  serve  my  brother  and  carefully 
promote  his  honour.  Having  brought  back  Shri  Rama  to  the 
capital,  I,  myself,  shall  inhabit  the  forest.  O  Thou,  of  evil 
intent,  how  shall  I  endure  thine  iniquity,  when  looked  on  by 
the  people  of  the  capital  with  sorrow-stricken  gaze  ?  Now  it 
befits  thee  to  enter  the  fire  or  hang  thyself  in  the  Dandaka  forest, 
death  alone  is  thy  desert !  Only  when  Rama  returns  and  that 
Prince  of  Truth  is  by  my  side,  shall  I  find  peace  and  my  purpose 
be  accomplished ! " 

1  Indra  was  sometimes  called  the  "  Bearer  of  the  Mace  ".

Bharata,  lamenting  and  breathing  like  a  serpent,  fell  to  the 
earth  like  an  elephant  tormented  by  the  goad.  His  eyes  red 
with  anger,  his  dress  loosened,  his  jewels  cast  aside,  he  fell 
like  the  banner  of  Indra,  uprooted  at  the  close  of  a  ceremony. 


chapter   75 

He  seeks  to  console  Queen  Kaushalya 

The  valiant  Bharata,  regaining  consciousness,  his  eyes  suffused 
with  tears,  perceived  his  mother  filled  with  distress.  Seated 
in  the  midst  of  his  counsellors,  he  poured  forth  reproaches 
on  his  mother  saying :  "  It  was  never  my  desire  to  rule,  nor 
did  I  consult  my  mother  in  this  matter ;  I  was  not  acquainted 
with  the  king's  intention  to  confer  the  crown  on  Rama,  being 
far  from  the  capital  with  Shatrughna.  I  knew  nought  of  the 
exile  of  Shri  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sita,  nor  how  it  came  to 
pass.    My  heart  is  filled  with  anguish." 

Kaushalya,  hearing  the  sound  of  Bharata's  weeping,  said  to 
Sumitra :  "  Bharata,  the  son  of  the  cruel  Kaikeyi,  has  come, 
I  wish  to  see  the  prudent  Bharata." 

The  queen,  pale  and  weak  on  account  of  her  separation  from 
Rama,  advanced  trembling  to  where  Bharata  was,  while  the 
prince  with  his  brother  Shatrughna  started  likewise  for  the 
apartment  of  the  queen.  The  two  brothers  beheld  the  wretched 
queen  proceeding  with  tottering  footsteps  and  were  filled  with 
distress.  Bowing  down  to  Kaushalya,  they  wept  bitterly,  then 
the  chief  queen  embraced  Bharata  sobbing  with  grief  and  said : 
"  It  was  thy  desire  to  rule  and  thy  cruel  mother  has  accomplished 
this  matter  without  hindrance,  but  for  what  reason  has  this 
pitiless  queen  sent  my  son  to  the  forest  in  ascetic's  garb  ?  Let 
Queen  Kaikeyi  banish  me  also  to  that  region  where  my  illustrious 
and  golden-complexioned  Rama  abides  !  If  not,  I  will  go 
together  with  Sumitra  to  where  Rama  dwells,  preceded  by  the 
sacrificial  fire.  O  Bharata,  do  thou  take  me  to  where  my  son, 
that  lion  among  men,  in  great  affliction  is  practising  asceticism, 
323 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Queen  Kaikeyi  has  made  thee  sovereign  of  this  country,  replete 
with  wealth,  grain,  horses,  elephants  and  chariots." 

Hearing  the  bitter  words  of  Queen  Kaushalya,  Bharata  was 
pained  as  a  man  who  suffers  when  his  wound  is  probed  by 
a  lancet.  Agitated  and  confused,  he  fell  at  the  feet  of  the  queen 
lamenting.  Then  growing  composed,  with  joined  palms,  he 
addressed  the  sorrowing  queen :  "  O  Mother,  thou  knowest 
how  great  is  my  love  for  Rama  and  also  that  I  am  innocent 
in  this  matter.  Why  dost  thou  reproach  me  ?  May  he,  who 
is  the  cause  of  the  exile  of  Rama,  forget  the  teachings  of  the 
Vedas  and  the  holy  tradition.  May  he,  who  has  given  his 
consent  to  the  exile  of  Rama,  become  a  slave  of  the  lowest  caste 
or  incur  the  sin  of  killing  a  cow.  May  such  a  man  be  subject 
to  the  same  punishment  as  one  who  withholds  the  wages  of 
his  labourers.  May  he  who  has  consented  to  the  banishment 
of  the  holy  prince,  bear  the  same  guilt  as  one  rebelling  against 
a  king,  who  protects  his  subjects  as  his  own  offspring !  May 
the  guilt  of  a  king  taking  the  sixth  part  of  the  revenue  of  his 
people  and  yet  failing  to  protect  them,  be  his,  who  exiled  Rama. 

"  May  the  fruits  of  the  sin  incurred  by  one  who,  well-equipped 
with  elephants,  horses  and  chariots  and  all  weapons,  does  not 
fight  according  to  the  law  of  righteousness,  be  his  !  May  he, 
who  agreed  to  the  exile  of  Rama,  forget  the  teachings  of  Vedanta 
which  ensure  happiness,  and  all  the  secrets  obtained  from  his 
spiritual  preceptor  by  serving  him !  May  such  a  one  not  live 
to  see  the  coronation  of  Prince  Rama  whose  countenance  equals 
the  sun  and  moon  in  splendour.  May  that  wretch  incur  the  sin 
of  one,  who,  partaking  of  milk  and  rice,  does  not  make  an 
offering  to  his  ancestors  and  guests  or  to  the  gods.  May  he  be 
guilty  of  not  honouring  his  spiritual  preceptor  by  offering 
salutations  to  him  in  a  fitting  manner. 

"  May  that  wretch,  who  gave  consent  to  the  exile  of  Rama, 
bear  the  same  guilt  as  one  who  strikes  a  cow,  reviles  his  Guru 
or  betrays  his  friends !  May  he  incur  the  guilt  of  one  who 
forswears  his  trust.  May  he,  who  participated  in  the  exile  of 
Rama,  reap  the  sin  of  one  who  does  not  do  good  to  others. 

"  May  the  wretch,  who  ordered  the  exile  of  Rama,  bear  the 
guilt  of  one,  who,  partaking  of  sweetmeats,  fails  to  share  them 
with  his  servants,  women,  children  or  those  surrounding  him,

or  one  who,  living  on  excellent  food,  gives  to  his  inferiors  that

sent  into  exile,  die  without  marrying  a  woman  of  his  own  caste  or 
producing  offspring  or  performing  the  fire  ritual !  May  he  not 
behold  the  offspring  born  of  his  spouse !  May  his  years  be 
brief !  May  he  be  slain  in  battle,  retreating  from  a  superior  foe 
in  fear,  or  may  he  be  as  one  who  slays  a  fleeing  enemy.  May  he, 
like  one  dressed  in  rags,  demented,  carrying  a  skull  in  his  hand, 
wander  about  begging  from  door  to  door !  May  he  who  has 
conspired  to  send  Rama  to  the  forest  be  given  over  to  wine, 
women  and  gambling  and  become  an  object  of  contempt  on 
account  of  his  concupiscence  and  anger.  May  he  ever  indulge 
in  the  practice  of  unrighteousness  and  forget  his  duty  and 
distribute  immense  wealth  in  charity  to  the  undeserving ! 
May  the  accumulated  wealth  and  extensive  possessions  of  the  one 
who  has  furthered  the  exile  of  Rama,  be  stolen  away  by  thieves. 
May  the  sin  of  him  who  sleeps  at  sunrise  or  sunset  be  his ! 
May  the  sin  of  him  who  is  guilty  of  arson  or  looks  with  desire 
on  the  wife  of  his  spiritual  preceptor  or  who  betrays  his  friend, 
be  his,  who  has  advocated  the  exile  of  Shri  Rama  !  May  he, 
who  acquiesced  in  the  exile  of  Rama  be  deprived  of  the  worship 
of  his  ancestors  and  parents  as  also  of  the  funeral  rites  !  May 
such  a  one,  even  now,  be  driven  from  the  society  of  good  people 
and  lose  the  renown  and  merit  of  companionship  with  the 
virtuous !  May  his  mind  never  be  devoted  to  such  deeds  as 
are  undertaken  by  the  righteous !  May  that  man  who  sought 
to  exile  Rama,  fail  to  obey  his  mother  and  ever  be  employed 
n  evil  deeds !  May  he  maintain  a  large  family  in  extreme 
poverty !  May  he,  ever  restless,  be  consumed  with  fever ! 
May  he  be  guilty  of  that  sin  incurred  by  one,  who  fails  to  satisfy 
a  miserable  suppliant  who  looks  to  him  for  succour  !  May  he 
be  deceitful,  slanderous,  base,  depraved  and  ever  walk  in  fear 
of  authority !  May  he  incur  the  guilt  of  one  who  disregards 
his  chaste  and  devoted  wife,  who  approaches  him  in  the  season 
of  her  flowering !  May  he  be  dull-witted  and  abandoning  bis 
lawful  spouse,  may  he  live  in  sin  with  other  women !  May 
the  guilt  of  a  brahmin  who  abandons  his  children,  who  are 
dying  of  hunger  be  his !  May  he  be  like  one  who  denies  a 
reservoir  or  administers  poison  to  another!  May  that  man 
325 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

lose  the  power  of  his  limbs,  as  he  who  seeks  to  impede  the 
hospitality  to  be  shown  to  a  brahmin,  by  speaking  ill  of  him ! 
May  his  be  the  sin  of  one  who  drinks  the  milk  of  the  cow  that 
possesses  unweaned  calves  !  May  he  incur  the  sin  of  him,  who, 
having  water  in  his  dwelling,  turns  the  thirsty  man  from  his 
door !  May  he  bear  the  guilt  of  him,  who  arbitrating  between 
two  learned  disputants,  grants  victory  to  the  one  he  favours  ! " 

With  these  words,  Prince  Bharata,  seeking  to  console  Queen 
Kaushalya  for  the  separation  from  her  son,  fell  to  the  ground, 
overcome  with  distress. 

The  queen  then  addressed  him,  who,  distraught  and  afflicted, 
seeking  to  establish  his  innocence,  had  fallen  to  the  earth,  and 
said :  "  My  Son,  my  pain  is  increased  by  the  words  thou  hast 
uttered  but  fortunate  it  is  that  the  hearts  of  Lakshmana  and 
thyself  are  fixed  in  love  of  thy  brother.  Assuredly  thou  wilt 
enter  the  region  attained  by  the  blest" 

Then  the  queen,  taking  the  mighty-armed  prince  in  her  lap, 
wept  aloud. 

The  prince  whose  heart  was  rent  with  grief  also  wept  in  an 
excess  of  sorrow.  Caressed  by  the  queen,  lamenting  wildly, 
lying  on  the  earth  and  sighing  heavily,  he  passed  the  night 
in  this  wise. 


chapter  76 

The  prince  commences  the  performance  of  the  funeral  rites 

Skri  Vasishtha,  renowned  among  the  sages,  beholding  Shri 
Bharata  overcome  by  grief,  addressed  him  in  sage  words, 
saying :  "  O  Illustrious  Prince,  may  happiness  be  thine,  restrain 
thy  grief  1  The  time  has  now  come  to  perform  the  obsequies 
of  the  great  king!" 

Bharata,  lying  on  the  earth,  heard  the  commands  of  the  holy 
sage,  and  rising,  began  to  perform  the  funeral  rites. 

The  attendants  now  removed  the  body  of  the  monarch  from 
the  vessel  of  oil  and  laid  it  on  the  earth.  Though  the  body 
32« 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

had  assumed  a  yellow  hue  through  being  immersed  in  oil  for 
many  days,  yet  it  appeared  as  if  the  king  slept. 

They  then  laid  the  king  on  a  couch  set  with  gems  and  Bharata, 
overwhelmed  with  grief,  began  to  lament.  He  said :  "  O 
Great  King,  I  know  not  why,  in  mine  absence,  thou  didst  send 
Rama  to  the  forest.  Whither  art  thou  gone,  leaving  me  bereft 
of  Rama,  that  Lion  among  men  and  the  Doer  of  famous  deeds  ? 
0  Great  Sovereign,  who  with  a  constant  mind  is  able  to  preserve 
his  mighty  kingdom?  Thou  art  dead  and  Shri  Rama  is 
banished.  O  Mighty  Ruler,  this  earth  is  widowed  and  divested 
of  all  beauty  without  thee !  Without  thee,  the  capital  resembles 
a  moonless  night." 

Shri  Vasishtha  again  addressed  Shri  Bharata,  perceiving  him 
still  to  be  a  prey  to  grief  and  said  :  "  O  Mighty-armed  Prince 
this  is  no  time  for  giving  way  to  sorrow  or  procrastination, 
now  perform  the  last  rites  for  the  king." 

Thus  addressed,  Shri  Bharata  with  the  aid  of  the  brahmins 
and  the  spiritual  preceptor  of  the  monarch,  inaugurated  the 
funeral  ceremonies. 

In  the  sacrificial  hall,  the  priests  performed  the  fire  ritual. 
The  servitors  placed  the  body  of  the  king  on  a  litter  and  conveyed 
it  thence,  weeping  and  lamenting.  Scattering  golden  coins,  and 
silver  flowers  and  laying  cloths  before  the  bier,  they  proceeded 
on  their  way,  while  before  the  palace,  sandalwood,  ambergris 
and  incense  were  kindled. 

On  the  banks  of  the  river  Sarayu,  a  funeral  pyre  of  devadaru,1 
sandal  and  other  fragrant  woods,  was  raised.  Aromatic  herbs 
were  thrown  on  the  pyre  and  the  body  of  the  king  laid  upon  it. 
The  sacrificing  priests  poured  oblations  on  the  funeral  pile, 
to  the  end  that  the  monarch  should  attain  the  beatific  state, 
and  intoned  the  traditional  mantrams,  whilst  the  brahmins, 
acquainted  with  the  Sama  Veda,3  sang  the  Sama  hymns. 

The  queens,  carried  in  palanquins,  attended  by  the  royal 
and  aged  guards,  approached  the  funeral  pyre,  weeping.  Then 
they,  overcome  with  grief,  together  with  the  priests  circum- 
ambulated the  blazing  body  of  the  king.  The  piteous  wailing 
of  the  stricken  Queens  and  the  cries  of  distress  of  innumerable

women  following  them,  resembled  the  call  of  the  krauncha  birds 
in  the  mating  season.  Then  the  queens,  abandoning  their 
vehicles,  approached  the  bank  of  the  river  Sarayu  and,  together 
with  Prince  Bharata,  the  counsellors  and  ministers,  offered 
libations  of  water ;  thereafter,  weeping  bitterly,  they  returned 
to  the  capital,  where  for  the  period  of  ten  days  they  slept  on 
the  bare  earth. 


CHAPTER     77 

The  ceremonies  are  continued 

On  the  eleventh  day,  Prince  Bharata  purified  himself  and  on 
the  twelfth  day  he  performed  the  Sapindi1  ceremony,  and 
distributed  jewels,  gold,  silver,  gorgeous  apparel  and  other 
articles  among  the  brahmins. 

He  also  gave  in  charity  countless  white  goats  and  cows,  male 
and  female  servants,  chariots  and  horses.  On  the  thirteenth 
day,  the  mighty-armed  Bharata,  overcome  with  grief,  went  to 
collect  the  ashes  of  the  king  and,  standing  near  the  funeral  pyre, 
spoke  in  a  voice  choked  with  emotion.  He  said :  "  O  Lord, 
my  brother,  Ramachandra,  to  whom  thou  hadst  entrusted  me, 
has  entered  the  forest  and  thou,  also,  hast  abandoned  me, 
helpless  and  wretched  as  I  am.  O  Father,  where  hast  thou  gone, 
abandoning  Mother  Kaushalya,  whose  son  is  now  exiled  ?  " 

Seeing  die  white  ashes  of  the  king's  bones  and  the  body 
wholly  consumed,  Bharata  burst  into  fresh  lamentation,  and 
weeping,  fell  on  the  earth.  The  people  tried  to  raise  the 
prince  who  was  lying  on  the  ground  like  the  banner  of  Indra, 
its  support  broken.'  The  counsellors  raised  up  Prince  Bharata 
as  the  sages  formerly  lifted  up  King  Yayati,  who  had  fallen 
from  heaven  on  the  termination  of  the  fruit  of  his  merit. 
Perceiving  Bharata,  overcome  with  grief,  Shatrughna,  remember- 
ing his  sire,  also  fell  senseless  to  the  ground.

AYODHYA    KANDA 

Being  somewhat  restored,  they  called  to  mind  the  excellent 
qualities  of  their  illustrious  father  and  Shatrughna  cried : 
**  The  boons  exacted  by  Manthara  are  the  ocean  inhabited  by 
the  crocodile  Kaikeyi,  in  which  we  are  submerged.  O  Father, 
where  art  thou  gone,  abandoning  thy  tender  and  beloved  son 
Bharata  ?  Why  hast  thou  abjured  us,  thou  who  wast  wont  to 
give  us  delicious  food,  fitting  gifts,  robes  and  ornaments  ?  Who 
will  now  confer  these  favours  on  us  ?  Why  is  the  earth  not 
riven,  thus  deprived  of  an  illustrious  and  pious  sovereign  ? 
Alas  !  My  father  has  departed  to  heaven  and  Shri  Rama  has 
gone  to  the  forest !  How  can  I  continue  to  live  ?  Bereft  of 
my  rather  and  brother,  I  shall  enter  the  fire.  I  shall  not  return 
to  the  capital,  I  shall  go  to  Tapovana." 

The  palace  attendants  hearing  the  prince  grieving  so  bitterly, 
were  afflicted  and  fell  to  the  ground,  tormented  like  bulls  whose 
horns  are  broken. 

Then  the  excellent  and  wise  Vasishtha,  their  father's  chief  priest 
raising  Bharata  up,  addressed  him,  saying  :  "  O  Prince,  thirteen 
days  have  passed  since  the  cremation  of  thy  illustrious  father's 
body.  Do  not  delay  longer,  but  collect  the  bones  that  remain. 
Every  man  suffers  the  three  pairs  of  opposites ;  hunger  and  thirst, 
pleasure  and  pain,  life  and  death.  Do  not  permit  thyself  to 
grieve  for  that  which  cannot  be  avoided." 

Then  the  wise  Sumantra  raised  up  Shatrughna  and  consoling 
him  explained  the  nature  of  birth  and  death  that  visits  all  beings. 
Standing  erect,  those  two  lions  among  men,  their  eyes  red  with 
much  weeping,  resembled  the  standards  of  Indra,  bereft  of  glory 
by  the  effects  of  sun  and  rain.  Then  the  counsellors  approached 
the  two  princes  and  requested  them  to  undertake  the  remaining 
ceremonies.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    78 

The  hunchback,  Manthara,  incurs  Prince  Shatrughna' s  displeasure 

As  Bharata,  still  grieving,  was  considering  how  he  should 
approach  Shri  Rama  in  the  forest,  Prince  Shatrughna  spoke : 
"  O  Brother,  how  is  it  that  Shri  Rama,  the  support  of  all  beings 
in  distress  and  who  is  powerful,  has  been  banished  to  the  forest 
with  his  consort  ?  -Even  if  Shri  Rama  were  bewildered,  why 
did  the  mighty  and  courageous  Lakshmana  not  defend  him 
and  restrain  his  father?  The  king,  falling  under  the  sway 
of  desire,  forsook  the  precepts  of  justice,  Prince  Lakshmana 
who  was  acquainted  with  what  was  right,  should  have  restrained 
the  king  from  this  sinful  act" 

While  Prince  Shatrughna  was  conversing  thus  with  Bharata, 
the  hunchback  Manthara,  attired  in  costly  garments,  adorned 
with  precious  gems,  appeared  at  the  east  door.  Painted  thickly 
with  sandalwood  paste,  wearing  a  robe  and  ornaments  befitting 
a  queen,  bestowed  on  her  by  Kaikeyi,  her  waist  encircled  by 
a  jewelled  girdle,  her  whole  body  covered  with  precious  stones, 
she  resembled  a  captive  monkey.  The  guards  seeing  that 
wicked  and  deformed  slave,  seized  her  and  said  to  Prince 
Shatrughna :  "  This  is  the  sinful  wretch  who  has  caused  the 
exile  of  Shri  Rama  and  the  death  of  the  king ;  deal  with  her 
according  to  thy  pleasure." 

On  hearing  the  words  of  the  guards,  the  prince  smarting 
with  indignation,  reflected  on  his  duty  and  said  to  those  in 
the  palace :  **  Let  this  woman,  the  cause  of  the  grief  of  my 
brothers  and  the  death  of  my  father,  suffer  the  consequence 
of  her  acts." 

Shatrughna  then  seized  Manthara  from  amidst  her  companions 
with  such  violence  that  her  shrieks  filled  the  palace !  The 
women,  perceiving  Shatrughna  so  enraged,  dealing  thus  with 
the  hunchback,  ran  away  in  all  directions.  They  reflected 
among  themselves,  saying :  "  The  enraged  prince  will  surely 
put  an  end  to  us  all,  let  us  therefore  take  refuge  with  the 
compassionate,  liberal  and  illustrious  Queen  Kaushalya,  she 
alone  will  protect  us." 

330 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

Prince  Shatrughna,  the  conqueror  of  his  foes,  his  eyes  red 
with  anger  threw  Manthara  on  the  ground  and  forcibly  dragged 
her  hither  and  thither,  while  all  her  ornaments  were  scattered, 
causing  the  palace  to  look  like  the  autumn  sky,  studded  with 
stars !  Dragging  Manthara  in  anger  before  Queen  Kaikeyi, 
who  sought  to  deliver  her,  the  prince  reproached  his  mother 
with  bitter  words.  Pained  by  the  harsh  speech  of  Prince 
Shatrughna,  the  terrified  Kaikeyi  fled  to  Prince  Bharata  for 
protection. 

Perceiving  Shatrughna  overcome  by  anger,  Bharata  addressed 
him  saying :  "  O  Brother,  women  are  not  to  be  slain  by  any 
living  being,  therefore  pardon  her  and  set  her  free  !  If  women 
were  subject  to  the  law  of  retribution,  and  were  it  not  that 
Rama  would  forsake  me  as  a  matricide,  I  would  have  slain  this 
sinful  woman  long  since  !  If  Shri  Rama  became  acquainted 
with  our  treatment  of  this  deformed  woman,  he  would  never 
converse  more  with  us." 

Thus  instructed  by  Prince  Bharata,  Shatrughna  restrained 
his  wrath  and  released  Manthara,  who  fell  at  the  feet  of  Queen 
Kaikeyi,  panting  and  lamenting.  Perceiving  Manthara  full  of 
fear  under  Shatrughna's  displeasure  and  trembling  like  an 
imprisoned  krauncha  bird,  Kaikeyi  gradually  calmed  her. 


chapter   79 

Prince  Bharata  decides  to  go  to  the  forest  and  bring  back 
his  brother 

EARLY  on  the  fourteenth  day,  the  king's  ministers  being 
assembled,  thus  addressed  Prince  Bharata  :  "  Our  Venerable 
Sovereign,  King  Dasaratha,  having  sent  his  eldest  son,  Shri 
Rama  and  the  mighty  Prince  Lakshmana,  into  exile,  has,  himself, 
joined  the  circle  of  the  gods.  Thou  art  to-day  our  Lord,  O 
Mighty  Prince.  The  kingdom  is  now  rulerless  and  the  king 
bequeathed  it  to  thee,  it  is  not  improper  for  thee,  therefore,  to 
ascend  the  throne,  nor  will  any  censure  thee  on  this  Account. 
33* 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

0  Prince  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  all  the  articles  for  thy  coronation 
are  made  ready ;  thy  relatives,  counsellors  and  ministers  and 
the  citizens  look  to  thee.  O  Great  Prince,  accept  the  kingdom 
of  thy  paternal  ancestors  and  cause  thyself  to  be  installed  and 
protect  us  all." 

The  Speaker  of  Truth,  the  illustrious  Bharata,  hearing  these 
excellent  words,  reverently  circumambulating  the  articles 
designed  for  the  coronation  ceremony,  replied  to  those  who  thus 
addressed  him :  "  Hear,  O  My  People,  it  is  known  to  you  that 
according  to  the  tradition  of  our  Royal  House  the  throne  'is 
inherited  by  the  eldest  son  of  the  deceased  sovereign ;  it  is, 
therefore,  improper  for  you  to  make  this  request  to  me.  Shri 
Rama  is  my  elder  brother  and,  therefore,  should  be  king.  I 
shall  enter  the  forest  and  reside  there  during  fourteen  years 
in  his  stead.  Now  order  my  whole  army  to  hold  itself  in 
readiness,  I  will  go  to  the  forest  and  bring  my  brother  back, 
taking  with  me  all  the  articles  necessary  for  his  installation. 
Rama  will  there  be  proclaimed  king !  I  will  restore  him  like 
the  holy  tire  which  is  brought  to  the  place  of  sacrifice.  I  will 
never  suffer  the  ambitions  of  Queen  Kaikeyi  to  be  fulfilled. 

1  will  enter  the  forest,  hard  to  penetrate,  and  shall  make  Rama 
king.  Let  the  rough  and  uneven  roads  at  once  be  repaired  by 
skilled  artisans ;  let  them  be  followed  by  mechanics  and 
labourers." 

The  people  were  gratified  to  hear  the  auspicious  words  of 
the  prince  and  replied :  "  O  Prince,  may  the  Goddess  of 
Prosperity1  ever  abide  with  thee !  Desirous  of  making  Rama 
our  king,  thy  words  are  timely." 

Then  all  present  experienced  great  joy  and  shed  tears  of 
delight.  The  happy  courtiers,  ministers  and  servants  spoke 
cheerfully,  saying :  "  O  Chief  of  Men,  at  thy  command  we  are 
summoning  the  workmen  to  prepare  the  way."

CHAPTER    80 

A  royal  highway  is  constructed  for  the  prince 

Now,  commanded  by  Prince  Bharata,  water  diviners,  expert 
and  industrious  mechanics,  builders  of  bridges,  wheelwrights, 
men  able  to  perform  all  kinds  of  work,  woodcutters,  artisans 
skilled  in  the  sinking  of  wells,  labourers,  hewers  of  wood,  cooks 
and  those  acquainted  with  the  way,  set  forth.  The  multitude 
of  people  advancing,  appeared  astonishing,  like  the  sea  under 
the  full  moon. 

Those  proficient  in  various  ways,  equipped  with  axes  and 
other  implements,  advanced  in  groups,  cutting  through  trees, 
shrubs,  bushes  and  rocks,  levelling  them  and  hewing  out  a  path ; 
planting  trees  where  these  were  needed,  they  cut  back  the 
branches  of  others  that  obstructed  the  way.  Strong  men  set 
fire  to  tree  trunks  and  cleared  the  road,  levelling  the  uneven 
places  with  clay  and  filling  the  ditches.  Others  bridged  the 
small  rivers  and  brooks  and  swept  the  road  clear  of  pebbles 
and  thorns,  pulverizing  the  rocks  that  impeded  the  flow  of  water. 
They  speedily  built  barriers  to  dam  the  small  streams  and 
deepened  the  ponds  by  digging  in  many  places.  They  also 
sank  wells  where  water  was  scarce,  and  built  platforms  on  which 
men  could  rest.  Lime  was  spread  on  the  road,  trees  were 
planted  where  birds  sang  and  the  highway  appeared  as  if  adorned 
with  banners.  Sprinkled  with  the  essence  of  sandalwood  and 
decorated  with  flowering  branches,  it  resembled  the  pathway 
of  the  Gods. 

Those  skilled  in  building  prepared  dwellings  on  pleasant  sites 
near  fresh  water  and  fruit  trees.  Camps  were  set  up  for  the 
army  in  accordance  with  Prince  Bharata's  instructions  and  all 
that  was  needed  was  provided. 

Those  acquainted  with  the  auspicious  planetary  positions 
erected  quarters  for  the  illustrious  Bharata.  Bordered  by  deep 
moats  with  intersecting  roads,  these  camps  were  as  lofty  as  the 
blue  mountain. 

Stately  white  temples  were  set  up,  and  rows  of  houses, 
bordering  the  roads,  were  adorned  with  flags.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

The  balconies  on  the  buildings,  elevated  like  dovecotes, 
resembled  the  abode  of  the  gods,  and  the  whole  arena  rivalled 
Indra's  capital. 

The  way  prepared  for  Prince  Bharata,  extended  to  the  banks 
of  the  Ganges  in  whose  cool  waters  fishes  glided,  as  it  flowed 
between  woods  and  forests,  and  that  royal  highway,  erected  by 
skilled  artisans,  appeared  as  beautiful  as  the  night  sky,  adorned 
by  moon  and  stars. 


CHAPTER    8  I 

Vasishtha  summons  the  royal  assembly 

Yet  a  little  of  the  enchanting  night  still  remained,  when  the 
bards  began  to  praise  the  prince ;  three  hours  before  the  sun 
rose,  the  great  drums  were  struck  with  golden  sticks,  while 
conches  were  blown  and  the  sound  of  countless  musical  instru- 
ments was  heard. 

The  music  filling  the  heavens  increased  the  grief  of  Prince 
Bharata,  who  commanded  it  to  cease,  saying :  "I  am  not  the 
king."  Then  addressing  Prince  Shatrughna,  he  said  :  "  Hear, 
O  Brother,  how  unfitting  are  the  praises  now  sung  at  the  instance 
of  Queen  Kaikeyi.  She  has  done  us  a  great  wrong.  The  king 
has  departed  to  the  regions  of  the  gods  and  left  me  desolate. 
The  future  and  the  kingdom  trembling  in  uncertainty,  resembles 
a  ship  without  a  pilot  drifting  on  the  ocean.  My  father  is  dead 
and  my  mother,  abandoning  the  path  of  virtue,  has  sent  Shri 
Rama  into  exile.'1 

The  women  of  the  palace,  hearing  the  great  prince  lamenting, 
began  to  weep  aloud  pitifully.  At  this  time,  the  great  and 
illustrious  Sage  Vasishtha,  versed  in  the  science  of  government, 
appeared  in  the  assembly  hall,  which  was  decorated  with  wrought 
gold,  encrusted  with  gems.  Attended  by  his  followers,  the 
spiritual  preceptor  of  the  royal  dynasty,  entered  the  council 
chamber,  as  Indra  enters  the  celestial  hall  named  Sudharma. 
Seated  on  a  golden  throne,  which  was  covered  with  an  excellent 
334 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

carpet  with  the  swastika  design,  Shri  Vasishtha  said  to  the 
messengers  :  "  Go  speedily  and  summon  the  learned  brahmins, 
the  counsellors,  the  warriors  and  the  leaders  of  the  army; 
matters  of  great  importance  await  them !  Bring  also  the  royal 
princes  together  with  their  secretaries  and  ministers,  Yudhajita 
and  Sumantra ! " 

A  great  tumult  now  arose  from  those  invited,  who  approached 
in  chariots  and  on  horses  and  elephants. 

The  counsellors  seeing  Prince  Bharata  drawing  near,  were 
gladdened  by  his  sight  as  though  King  Dasaratha  himself  had 
entered  the  assembly. 

The  presence  of  Bharata  added  to  the  splendour  of  the  court 
so  that  it  appeared  as  when  Ring  Dasaratha  was  present,  or  as 
the  clear  waters  of  the  ocean  are  enhanced  by  whales,  alligators, 
shells  and  golden  sand. 


CHAPTER    82 

The  chiefs  of  the  army  prepare  for  departure 

The  wise  Bharata  beheld  the  royal  assembly  presided  over 
by  the  great  Vasishtha  and  other  venerable  sages,  resembling 
the  night  made  glorious  by  the  full  moon.  IUumined  by  these 
excellent  ones,  who  occupied  their  seats,  attired  in  splendid 
apparel,  the  conclave  was  of  incomparable  brilliance.  The 
assembly  of  learned  men  resembled  the  beauty  of  the  full  moon 
on  a  winter's  night. 

The  virtuous  priest,  Shri  Vasishtha,  beholding  all  the  ministers 
and  the  chief  counsellors,  gently  addressed  Bharata,  saying : 
**  O  Child,  King  Dasaratha,  having  practised  virtue  in  his  life, 
has  bequeathed  this  rich  and  prosperous  land  to  thee.  Shri 
Ramachandra  observing  the  vow  of  truth,  in  obedience  to  his 
father  and  in  conformity  with  the  duty  incumbent  on  him,  to 
vindicate  his  parents,  has  not  failed  to  accomplish  his  father's 
command,  as  the  moon  does  not  abstain  from  shedding  abroad 
its  radiance.  Now  enjoy  the  possession  of  this  peaceful  kingdom 
335  « 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

given  to  thee  by  thy  father  and  brother !  To  please  thy  coun- 
sellors, cause  thyself  to  be  installed.  The  kings  of  the  north, 
south  and  west,  the  peers  and  titular  sovereigns  of  the  western 
boundary  and  the  monarchs  of  many  islands,  will  bring  thee 
countless  gems  as  offerings." 

Hearing  the  words  of  his  spiritual  preceptor,  Prince  Bharata 
was  distressed,  knowing  well  that  according  to  the  ancient  tradi- 
tion of  his  dynasty,  the  eldest  son  inherits  the  kingdom.  Calling 
Rama  to  remembrance,  Shri  Bharata  resolved  to  seek  out  bis 
elder  brother.  The  throat  of  the  youthful  prince  was  choked  and 
in  tones  resembling  the  cry  of  the  swan,  he  plaintively  reproached 
the  venerable  Guru  for  the  impropriety  of  his  command. 

Bharata  said :  "  O  Holy  Lord,  how  can  I  usurp  the  legitimate 
possession  of  one,  who,  learned  in  the  Vedas  and  sciences, 
acquired  by  dwelling  as  a  servant  in  the  house  of  his  Guru, 
knows  their  meaning  well  and  follows  them  in  practice  ?  How 
can  one,  born  of  King  Dasaratha,  striving  to  fulfil  the  law  of 
dharma,  take  possession  of  the  kingdom  of  Rama  ?  Not  only 
does  the  kingdom  belong  to  Rama,  but  I  also  belong  to  him. 
O  Holy  One,  may  thy  counsels  accord  with  righteousness  | 
King  Dasaratha  owned  this  kingdom  as  did  King  Dilipa  and 
Nahusha  before  him,  so  should  the  virtuous  Prince  Rama,  the 
eldest  and  most  excellent  son,  inherit  the  kingdom ! 

"  If,  as  instructed  by  thee,  I  accept  it,  it  would  be  a  great 
sin  and  worthy  of  an  evil-doer,  not  in  accordance  with  the 
way  that  leads  to  heaven  and  I  should  be  adjudged  the 
destroyer  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku.  I  abhor  the  wrong  com- 
mitted by  my  mother,  and  I  offer  salutations  to  Rama  residing 
in  the  forest ;  I  will  follow  him,  he  alone  is  king  and  worthy  of 
ruling  the  three  worlds !  It  were  easy  for  him  to  administer 
this  kingdom." 

All  seated  in  the  assembly,  devoted  to  Rama,  having  listened 
to  the  righteous  words  of  Bharata,  shed  tears  of  joy.  Once 
again  Shri  Bharata  spoke,  saying :  "  If  I  fail  to  bring  back 
Shri  Rama  then  I  will  dwell  there  with  him  in  the  forest  as 
Lakshmana  has  done.  O  Ye  Wise  Men,  accompany  me  to  the 
forest  and  with  your  good  help,  I  will  try  every  means  to  persuade 
him  to  return ;  skilled  excavators,  engineers  and  carpenters 
have  been  sent  forward  by  me  to  render  the  road  passable."

AYODHYA    KANDA 

The  lover  of  his  brother,  Shri  Bharata,  turning  to  the  royal 
counsellors,  addressed  the  wise  Sumantra  seated  near  them  and 
said :  "  Go  speedily  and  summon  the  army  in  my  name  to 
accompany  me  to  the  forest  and  bring  the  leaders  here." 

Sumantra  gladly  carried  out  the  commands  of  Prince  Bharata. 
The  military  commanders  were  filled  with  joy  at  the  order  of 
Prince  Bharata  to  proceed  with  the  army  to  recall  Shri  Rama. 
In  every  home,  wives  joyfully  urged  their  husbands  to  go  with 
all  speed  and  bring  back  Shri  Rama. 

The  leaders  of  the  army  riding  their  swift  horses  or  in  bullock 
carts  and  chariots  gave  the  order  to  march.  His  preceptor  the 
Guru  Vasishtha  being  near,  Shri  Bharata  said  to  Sumantra  who 
was  at  his  side,  "Speedily  prepare  my  chariot".  Sumantra 
replied  with  reverence  "  Be  it  so  "  and  highly  pleased  brought 
the  chariot  to  which  excellent  horses  were  yoked.  The  Prince, 
filled  with  fortitude,  illustrious,  of  fixed  vows  and  a  hero  of 
the  region  of  truth,  resolving  to  recall  Shri  Rama  from  the  forest, 
addressed  Sumantra  saying :  "  O  Sumantra,  mobilise  the  army 
and  order  my  friends  and  the  chiefs  of  the  people  to  be  prepared. 
I  desire  to  recall  Rama  for  the  good  of  the  world." 

As  instructed  by  the  great  prince,  Sumantra  speedily  issued 
the  command  to  the  chiefs  of  the  army  and  the  friends  of  Bharata, 
fully  explaining  its  purpose.  In  every  dwelling  the  brahmins, 
the  warriors,  the  merchants  and  the  labourers  brought  together 
camels,  chariots,  mules,  elephants  and  excellent  horses.

The  whole  army  reaches  the  river  Ganges 

Early  in  the  morning,  the  prince  rose  and  mounting  an  excellent 
chariot,  set  out  in  haste,  desirous  of  seeing  Rama.  Shri 
Bharata's  chariot  was  preceded  by  ministers  on  horseback  and 
priests  in  coaches  and  shone  like  the  vehicle  of  the  sun.  Nine 
thousand  richly  bedecked  elephants  and  sixty  thousand  carts 
337 


THE  RAMAYANA  OF  VALMIKI 
with  archers,  together  with  a  hundred  thousand  troops,  accom- 
panied the  self-controlled  prince,  the  devotee  of  truth.  Kaikeyi, 
Sumitra  and  the  renowned  Kaushalya  riding  in  resplendent 
chariots,  went  forward  to  bring  Rama  home.  The  multitude 
of  the  twice  bom  proceeding  from  the  capital,  conversed  solely 
of  Shri  Ramachandra  and  listened  only  to  that  which  related 
to  him.  They  said :  "  When  shall  we  behold  Shri  Rama,  that 
cloud-complexioned,  mighty  armed  one,  of  fixed  purpose ;  the 
destroyer  of  the  grief  of  the  world  ?  As  the  rising  sun  ends 
the  darkness  of  the  earth,  so  by  the  mere  beholding  of  Shri  Rama 
will  our  grief  disappear." 

Conversing  thus  of  Rama  and  embracing  each  other,  the 
citizens  went  forward,  filled  with  gladness. 

The  foremost  merchants  of  Ayodhya  who  had  received 
permission  from  Bharata  to  accompany  him,  also  those  who 
had  not  been  so  favoured  and  others,  went  forward  happily 
to  meet  Rama.  Skilful  engravers,  potters,  weavers  and  workers 
in  gems,  those  who  made  fans  of  peacocks'  feathers,  woodcutters, 
plasterers,  workers  in  glass  and  ivory,  masons  and  perfumers, 
famous  goldsmiths,  makers  of  woollen  cloth,  washermen, 
masseurs,  appliers  of  unguents,  physicians  and  those  who 
fumigated  the  dwellings  with  incense,  also  retailers  of  wine 
were  present.  Fullers,  tailors,  chiefs  of  villages,  cowherds, 
dancing  men  and  women,  fishermen,  and  countless  Vedic 
scholars  of  subdued  mind,  devoted  to  Rama,  followed  Prince 
Bharata  in  carts  drawn  by  bullocks.  All  apparelled  in  pure 
raiment,  their  bodies  anointed  with  red  sandalwood,  mounted 
on  vehicles  of  various  kinds,  followed  in  the  wake  of  Prince 
Bharata.  The  leaders  of  the  army  joyfully  accompanied  the 
prince,  now  going  forth  to  bring  Prince  Rama  home. 

Mounted  in  chariots,  palanquins,  bullock  carts  or  on  horses 
and  elephants,  the  people  proceeded  a  considerable  distance 
and  reached  the  banks  of  the  Ganges  at  Shrangaverapur,  where 
the  friend  of  Shri  Rama,  Guha,  dwelt  with  his  people,  guarding 
his  country  with  vigilance.  Arriving  at  the  banks  of  Shri  Gunga, 
the  haunt  of  the  chakravaka1  bird,  those  following  the  prince 
halted.  The  eloquent  Bharata,  seeing  the  beautiful  Ganges, 
reviewed  his  troops  and  said  to  his  ministers : — 

1  Chakravaka  bird — Brahmany  duck.

"  Let  the  whole  army  camp  here  to-night,  to-morrow  we  will 
cross  the  river.  Now  I  desire  to  offer  a  libation  to  the  spirit 
of  my  father,  the  king ! " 

His  counsellors  replied,  "  Be  it  so,  O  Prince  ",  and  caused 
the  people  to  halt  there,  each  according  to  his  rank.  The  saintly 
Bharata  alone  in  his  tent,  on  the  banks  of  the  Ganges  reflected 
anxiously  how  he  might  best  bring  Shri  Rama  home.

Guha3  chief  of  ike  ferrymen,  is  filled  with  apprehension 

Observing  the  great  army  of  Bharata  encamped  on  the  river 
bank,  Guha  was  filled  with  apprehension,  and  said  to  his 
followers :  "  My  Friends,  this  great  army  which  is  occupying 
the  river  banks,  is  not  to  be  numbered  even  in  imagination. 
Assuredly  Prince  Bharata  has  come  here  with  evil  intent,  since 
the  flag  of  his  dynasty  flies  over  his  tent.  Either  he  is  come 
to  bind  and  destroy  me,  or  he  is  going  to  slay  Rama  who  is 
exiled  by  his  father,  and  helpless !  Perchance  the  son  of  Kaikeyi 
desires  to  slay  Rama  in  order  to  gain  complete  possession  of 
the  kingdom.  But  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  is  my  Lord, 
my  Supporter  and  my  Friend,  I  command  you,  therefore,  to  don 
your  armour  and  take  up  arms,  lining  the  banks  of  the  Ganges 
for  the  protection  of  Rama.  Let  my  servants  and  the  troops 
living  on  fruit,  roots  and  flesh  guard  the  ferry  boats  of  the 
Ganges.  Let  five  hundred  boats  be  manned  with  their  crews, 
and  let  each  be  guarded  by  youthful  watermen  well  armed  and 
accoutred.  See  that  they  are  vigilant.  If  Prince  Bharata  be 
well  disposed  towards  Rama,  his  army  may  cross  the  Ganges 
to-day." 

Thus,  mobilising  his  troops  and  servants,  Guha  the  chief 
of  ferrymen,  taking  gifts  of  fish,  flesh  and  honey,  went  to  meet 
Prince  Bharata.  Seeing  Guha  approaching,  the  excellent 
Sumantra  said  to  Bharata :  "  This  Guha  attended  by  a  thousand 
kinsmen  is  the  king  of  this  place,  he  is  a  native  of  these  parte 
339 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  is  fully  acquainted  with  the  forest,  he  is  a  friend  of  thy 
brother,  Shri  Rama.  Therefore,  O  Prince,  let  him  be  admitted 
in  audience  to  thee,  he  assuredly  knows  the  place  where  Rama 
and  Lakshmana  dwell." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  sagacious  Sumantra,  Bharata  said : 
"  Go  and  tell  Guha  that  I  desire  to  meet  him." 

The  sanction  of  Prince  Bharata  being  given,  Guha  with  the 
chiefs  of  his  people  approached  the  prince  and  thus  addressed 
him :  "  O  Lord,  consider  this  country  as  thine  own  domain  ; 
not  being  acquainted  with  thine  intention,  I  am  unable  to  offer 
thee  a  fitting  welcome.  This  inconsiderable  kingdom  is  thine 
and  we  also  are  thine !  We  entreat  thee  to  abide  in  thy  servant's 
house.  I  have  brought  roots,  fruits  and  flesh  both  fresh  and 
dried  for  thee  and  other  products  of  the  forest  for  thy  use. 
It  is  my  hope  that  thine  army  remain  here  to-night  as  my  guests ; 
may  we  have  occasion  to  serve  thee,  O  Prince  ;  to-morrow  thou 
canst  go  forward  with  thine  army." 


CHAPTER     85 

He  is  filled  with  joy  on  hearing  of  Prince  Bkarata's  intention 

The  wise  Bharata  listened  to  the  words  of  the  chief  of  ferrymen 
and  revealed  his  purpose  to  him,  stating  his  reasons  thus : 
"  O  Friend  of  my  elder  brother,  thy  hospitality  is  great,  since 
thou  desirest  to  entertain  so  great  an  army  as  accompanies  me." 

Prince  Bharata  then  addressed  Guha  once  more  in  gentle 
and  well-chosen  words,  and  said :  "  O  Chief  of  the  Nishadas, 
by  what  way  shall  I  proceed  to  the  hermitage  of  the  Sage 
Bharadwaja?  The  valley  of  the  Ganges  being  flooded  is 
difficult  to  cross." 

Guha,  acquainted  with  all  the  paths  and  inaccessible  parts 
of  the  forest,  replied  with  great  humility :  "  0  Illustrious  Prince, 
have  no  anxiety !  These,  my  kinsmen,  armed  with  bows  and 
arrows,  fully  acquainted  with  the  forest,  shall  accompany  thee, 
and  I  also  shall  follow  thee  in  person.  But  observing  thy  great 
340 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

army,  I  am  filled  with  apprehension.  Art  thou  going  to  approach 
Rama,  urged  by  some  evil  intent  ?  " 

Shri  Bharata,  whose  heart  was  pure  as  the  stainless  heavens, 
answered  him  in  sweet  accents,  saying :  "  O  Guha  !  May  the 
time  never  come  when  I  cause  him  distress.  Do  not  look  on 
me  with  fear  O  Friend  j  Rama,  my  elder  brother,  is  to  me 
equal  to  my  father  himself!  O  Guha,  I  go  to  bring  back  Shri 
Rama  from  the  forest.  Do  not  impute  any  evil  motive  to  me ! 
O  Friend,  this  is  the  truth  and  the  truth  alone." 

Guha  was  filled  with  joy  on  hearing  the  words  of  Prince 
Bharata  and  again  addressed  him  saying :  "  O  Bharata,  blessed 
art  thou.  In  the  whole  world,  I  see  none  equal  to  thee,  since 
thou  desirest  to  relinquish  a  great  empire  that  has  fallen  to  thee 
without  any  effort  of  thine  own.  Thy  fame  in  the  world  will 
live  forever,  since  thou,  suffering  distress,  didst  go  forth  to 
bring  back  Shri  Rama." 

While  Prince  Bharata  and  Guha  were  thus  conversing,  the 
sun  set  and  the  night  drew  on.  Gratified  with  the  converse 
and  hospitality  of  Guha,  his  army  fully  refreshed,  Shri  Bharata 
entered  his  tent  to  rest.  But  the  prince,  whose  heart  formerly 
had  been  unacquainted  with  grief  and  who  was  patient  and  free 
from  sin,  which  is  the  chief  cause  of  suffering,  was  yet  overcome 
by  pain  on  account  of  Rama.  Sorrow  for  Raghava  consumed  him 
inwardly,  as  a  fire  consumes  a  withered  and  hollow  tree  in  the 
forest.  The  perspiration  caused  by  the  fire  of  grief  ran  down 
bis  body,  as  the  snow  flows  from  the  Himalayan  peaks  melting 
under  the  heat  of  the  sun. 

By  the  mountain,  the  peak  of  which  was  sorrow,  the  recollec- 
tion of  Rama  the  rocks,  his  sighs  the  mineral  charged  streams, 
his  desolation  the  forest,  and  weariness  the  promontories,  his 
deep  anxiety  the  wild  beasts,  his  restlessness  the  herbs,  by 
this  mountain  of  affliction  was  Shri  Bharata  overwhelmed. 

Assailed  by  unspeakable  anguish,  the  prince  sighed  heavily 
and  almost  bereft  of  reason,  unconscious  of  his  body,  like  a  bull 
driven  from  the  herd,  was  deprived  of  all  rest. 

Guha  approaching  with  his  friends  and  kinsmen,  embracing 
Shri  Bharata,  gently  began  to  reassure  him,  regarding  his  elder 
brother.

CHAPTER    86 

Guha  tells  of  Shri  Rama's  stay  by  the  sacred  river 

The  dweller  in  that  dense  forest,  Guha,  began  to  console  the 
virtuous  and  affectionate  prince,  whose  love  for  the  pious 
Lakshmana  and  Shri  Ramachandra  was  unwavering,  and  said : 
"  O  Lord,  when  the  valiant  Lakshmana,  well  armed,  was  keeping 
watch  over  the  then  sleeping  Rama,  I  said  to  him,  '  O  Friend, 
a  soft  couch  is  prepared  for  thee,  sleep  thereon  at  ease,  O  Prince 
of  Raghu,  those  dwelling  in  the  forest  are  accustomed  to  hardship 
but  thou  art  worthy  of  comfort,  we  will  keep  guard  over 
Shri  Rama  this  night.  O  Prince,  there  is  none  in  the  world 
so  dear  to  us  as  Rama.  Be  not  anxious,  we  will  keep  watch 
over  Shri  Rama ;  do  thou  rest.  By  the  grace  of  Rama,  I  hope 
to  acquire  great  renown  and  the  limitless  wealth  of  dharma 
in  this  world.  Therefore,  O  Prince,  I  will  protect  my  friend, 
Shri  Rama  who  is  reposing  with  Sita !  My  kinsmen  will  keep 
watch ;  nothing  in  the  forest  is  unknown  to  me,  who  constantly 
traverse  it ;  I  could  challenge  a  great  army  with  success,  should 
it  venture  to  attack  Shri  Rama  !  " 

"  O  Lord,  the  illustrious  Lakshmana,  established  in  virtue, 
answered  me  saying :  '  O  Guha,  when  the  virtuous  Rama  and 
Sita  are  resting  on  the  naked  earth,  how  should  I  occupy  an 
easy  couch  ?  How  can  any  of  the  comforts  of  life  or  life  itself 
be  mine  if  Shri  Rama  does  not  also  enjoy  them  ?  O  Guha, 
behold  Shri  Rama,  capable  of  subduing  the  gods  and  demons, 
resting  on  a  bed  of  grass.  Through  great  austerity  and 
penance  was  Shri  Dasaratha  blessed  with  a  son,  like  unto  himself. 
Assuredly,  the  king  will  not  long  survive  the  exile  of  Shri  Rama, 
and  the  land  will  soon  become  widowed.  The  women  will 
lament  loudly  and  then  grow  silent.  I  fear  lest  my  Father, 
Queen  Kaushalya  and  my  mother  Sumitra  will  not  survive. 
Perchance  my  mother  will  continue  to  live  in  expectation  of  the 
return  of  Shatrughna,  but  Kaushalya,  the  mother  of  that  great 
hero  will  surely  die !  The  king  desired  to  transfer  the  throne 
to  Prince  Bharata,  but  this  ambition  will  not  be  realised  by  him. 
A  great  and  honourable  duty  will  be  fulfilled  in  performing 
34a 


AYODHYA  KANDA 
the  funeral  ceremonies  for  my  sire.  The  capital  of  the  king 
abounding  with  beautiful  terraces  and  parks,  pleasant  highways 
and  tall  houses  encrusted  with  gems,  crowded  with  horses, 
elephants  and  chariots,  resounding  with  music,  furnished  with 
pleasure  grounds,  where  happy  and  healthy  people  gather,  is 
blessed  by  those  who  walk  therein.  O  Guha,  shall  we,  returning 
with  Rama,  the  fulfiUer  of  firm  vows,  when  the  fourteen  years 
of  exile  are  over,  joyfully  enter  Ayodhya  in  his  company  ?  " 

Guha  said:  "O  Prince,  thus  keeping  watch,  the  mighty 
Lakshmana,  bearing  his  bow  and  arrows,  passed  the  night. 
When  the  clear  sun  rose,  the  two  princely  brothers,  on  this 
selfsame  bank  of  the  sacred  river  caused  their  beautiful  locks 
to  be  matted  and  were  then  conveyed  by  me,  in  safety,  over 
the  Ganges. 

The  royal  brothers,  heroic,  resplendent  and  the  subduers  of 
their  enemies,  their  hair  matted,  attired  in  bark,  armed  with 
bow  and  quiver,  departed  with  Sita,  looking  back  at  me,  like 
mighty  elephants.*' 


CHAPTER    87 

Horn  Shri  Rama  spent  his  first  night  of  exile 

Having  heard  the  moving  tale  related  by  Guha,  Prince  Bharata 
began  to  reflect  on  Rama.  That  tender  prince  of  powerful  arms, 
whose  shoulders  resembled  a  lion's  and  whose  eyes  were  like 
the  lotus,  who  was  patient,  youthful  and  charming  in  appearance 
yet  sad  at  heart,  at  length  sank  to  the  ground  unconscious, 
like  an  elephant  stricken  to  the  heart  by  a  goad. 

Prince  Shatrughna  ever  in  attendance  on  Bharata,  deeply 
afflicted  by  his  state,  embracing  his  body,  wept  aloud.  Then  all 
the  mothers  of  Prince  Bharata,  emaciated  with  fasting  and  sorrow 
for  their  deceased  lord,  surrounded  him,  lying  unconscious  on 
the  earth.  The  pious  Queen  Kaushalya  approaching,  raised 
Bharata  up  and  pressed  him  to  her  breast.  The  ascetic  queen, 
the  lover  of  her  son,  straining  him  to  her  bosom  as  if  he  were 
343 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

her  own  child,  weeping,  enquired  of  him,  saying  :  "  O  My  Son, 
art  thou  afflicted  by  pain  ?  The  life  of  this  royal  family  wholly 
depends  on  thee  !  O  Child,  Shri  Rama  has  gone  to  the  forest 
with  Lakshmana,  I  live  only  if  I  behold  thy  face.  King 
Dasaratha  being  dead,  thou  alone  art  the  protector  of  the  people. 
O  Child,  hast  thou  heard  aught  against  Lakshmana  or  my  only 
son,  who,  with  his  wife  is  gone  to  the  forest  ?  " 

The  renowned  Bharata  returning  to  his  normal  consciousness, 
consoled  the  weeping  Kaushalya  and  then  addressed  Guha : 
"  O  Guha,  where  did  my  brother  pass  the  night  here  ?  What 
did  he  eat,  on  what  couch  did  he  rest  ?  Where  did  Sita  and 
Lakshmana  dwell  ?  " 

Guha,  the  King  of  Nishadas,  gladly  related  how  he  had 
entertained  his  gracious  guest,  Shri  Rama.  He  said,  "  O 
Bharata,  rice,  other  foods  and  fruit  in  abundance  were  placed 
by  me,  before  Shri  Rama.  To  please  me,  that  hero  of  the  realm 
of  truth,  Shri  Ramachandra,  accepted  the  gifts,  but  recollecting 
his  duty  as  a  kshatriya  did  not  partake  of  them.  He  said : 
"  O  Friend,  we  are  warriors  and  it  is  our  duty  to  give  all  to 
others,  not  accepting  any  gift  for  ourselves." 

That  night,  the  great-hearted  Rama,  having  with  Sita  drunk 
the  water  brought  by  Shri  Lakshmana,  retired  to  rest,  fasting. 
Shri  Lakshmana  finishing  the  water  that  was  left  over,  all 
observed  silence  and  performed  the  evening  devotion  with  con- 
centration. Thereafter  the  son  of  Sumitra  brought  kusha 
grass  and  spread  it  on  the  earth  to  serve  as  a  couch  for  Rama. 
As  Shri  Rama  and  Sita  rested  there,  Shri  Lakshmana  washed 
their  feet  in  pure  water  and  then  moved  to  a  distance  to*  mount 
guard  over  them. 

O  Prince,  here  is  that  Ingudi  tree,  and  here  is  the  couch 
of  grass  on  which  Rama  and  Sita  slept.  That  hero,  Shri 
Lakshmana  with  his  quiver  filled  with  arrows,  bound  to  his  body, 
donning  gloves  made  of  goha-skin,  drawing  the  string  of  his  bow, 
paced  round  and  round  at  a  distance,  guarding  the  royal  pair. 

X  also,  O  Prince,  surrounded  by  my  kinsmen,  armed  with 
an  excellent  bow,  kept  watch  through  the  night,  protecting 
Shri  Ramachandra,  who  resembled  Indra.

CHAPTER     88 

Prince  Bharata  sleeps  on  the  same  spot  where  Shri  Rama 
had  rested 

Shri  Bharata  with  his  counsellors  reverently  approached  the 
Ingudi  tree  and  looked  with  love  on  the  grassy  couch.  He  said 
to  his  mothers :  "  This  grass  was  pressed  by  the  royal  frame 
of  the  illustrious  Ramachandra,  who  passed  the  first  night 
of  exile  in  this  place.  It  ill  became  the  great  and  wise  son 
of  King  Dasaratha  to  sleep  on  the  bare  earth !  How  could 
Shri  Rama,  who  ever  reposed  on  a  soft  couch,  sleep  on  the 
naked  ground  ?  Shri  Rama  who  dwelt  in  a  seven-storied  palace, 
the  floors  of  which  were  studded  with  gold  and  silver  flowers, 
overlaid  with  soft  carpets  of  many  a  hue  on  which  marvellous 
floral  designs  were  woven,  the  whole  fragrant  with  the  perfume 
of  sandalwood  and  ambergris,  and  which  resembled  the  clouds ; 
where  the  cries  of  parrots  and  mainas  were  constantly  heard 
and  cool  air  flowed  uninterruptedly  through  shafts ;  where  the 
walls  inlaid  with  gold  and  silver  resembled  the  Meru  mountain : 
in  such  a  palace,  Shri  Rama  was  accustomed  to  rest,  awakened 
each  morning  by  the  sweet  music  of  the  royal  musicians  and 
the  gentle  tinkling  of  women's  anklets,  and  duly  praised  by 
the  bards,  panegyrists  and  ministers,  in  verse  and  song.  To-day, 
he  sleeps  on  the  naked  earth  and  hears  the  cry  of  jackals  and 
other  wild  beasts.  This  matter  is  past  belief,  it  resembles  a 
dream !  I  consider  nothing  more  powerful  than  the  will  of 
the  Lord ;  how  otherwise  should  the  son  of  King  Dasaratha 
be  seen  sleeping  on  the  earth  ?  How  could  the  daughter  of 
King  Janaka,  that  beautiful  princess,  the  beloved  daughter-in- 
law  of  King  Dasaratha,  sleep  on  the  naked  ground  ? 

**  O  Mother,  here  is  my  brother's  couch,  on  it  he  tossed, 
crushing  the  grass  by  the  weight  of  bis  limbs.  It  would  seem 
that  Shri  Sita  rested  here  also,  wearing  her  ornaments,  since 
I  perceive  particles  of  gold  lying  here  and  there.  O  Mother, 
see  Sita's  scarf  became  entangled  here,  for  in  this  place  I  see 
threads  of  silk  !  Whether  it  be  hard  or  soft,  the  couch  of  her 
lord  is  sweet  to  a  woman  I  See  1  The  young  and  tender  Sita, 
345 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

devoted  to  her  husband,  experienced  no  smart,  resting  here. 
Oh !  I  am  undone !  What  a  merciless  wretch  am  I !  On 
my  account,  Shri  Ramachandra  and  his  spouse  lay  on  this  hard 
couch  I  Alas  that  Shri  Rama,  deprived  of  kingly  felicity, 
though  born  of  a  royal  line,  dear  to  all  and  the  cause  of  universal 
joy,  whose  complexion  resembles  the  blue  lotus,  whose  eyes 
are  slightly  red,1  charming  to  look  upon,  not  meriting  tribulation, 
should  have  to  sleep  on  the  naked  earth. 

"  Blessed  and  fortunate  is  Lakshmana,  who  followed  his 
brother  in  the  days  of  adversity  !  Fruitful  is  the  life  of  Princess 
Sita  who,  thus  accompanied  her  lord  to  the  forest.  Wretched 
are  we,  bereft  of  Shri  Rama ;  nor  are  we  certain  that  he  will 
allow  us  to  serve  him.  King  Dasaratha,  being  dead,  and  Shri 
Rama  having  entered  the  forest,  the  earth  appears  to  me  like  a 
boat  without  a  pilot.  None  desires  to  usurp  the  place  spiritually 
reserved  for  him,  who  dwells  in  the  forest.  To-day  the  capital 
is  empty  and  unprotected,  horses  and  elephants  wander  here 
and  there  unconfincd,  there  being  none  to  control  them ;  the 
gates  of  the  city  are  left  open  and  unguarded ;  the  army  is 
melancholy  and  indifferent  to  the  defence  of  the  capital! 
Ayodhya  externally  without  protection  and  bereft  of  purpose, 
is  in  a  sorry  state.  Even  its  enemies  torn  from  it,  as  men 
turn  away  from  poisoned  food ! 

"  From  to-day,  assuming  an  ascetic  garb,  I  will  sleep  on  the 
earth  and  live  on  fruit  and  roots.  I  shall  live  in  the  forest  for 
the  remainder  of  the  term  which  Rama  has  to  discharge,  so 
that  his  vow  may  be  fulfilled.  My  brother  Shatrughna  shall 
dwell  with  me  in  the  forest,  while  Lakshmana  returns  with  Rama 
to  protect  the  capital !  The  learned  brahmins  will  install  Shri 
Rama  in  Ayodhya !  I  entreat  the  gods  to  fulfil  the  desire  of 
my  heart.  If  Rama,  however,  will  not  grant  my  request,  I  will 
remain  in  the  forest  as  his  servant,  but  how  should  he  reject 
my  appeal  ?    Is  he  not  compassionate  towards  his  devotees  ?  " 


1  This  is  said  to  be  one  of  the  marks  of  a  divine  Incarnation.

CHAPTER     89 

The  army  crosses  the  holy  river 

Bharata  having  slept  on  the  same  spot  where  Shri  Rama  had 
lately  rested,  and  the  night  being  over,  called  Shatrughna,  and 
said  to  him :  "Arise,  O  Brother,  may  good  attend  thee  !  The 
day  has  dawned,  sleep  no  more !  Please  summon  Guha,  the 
chief  of  the  Nishadas,  so  that  he  may  convey  our  army  across 
the  river." 

Shatrughna  answered :  "  O  Noble  One,  I  am  awake.  I  was 
not  able  to  sleep,  for  like  thee  I  have  been  meditating  on  Shri 
Rama!" 

As  these  two,  die  chiefs  of  men,  stood  conversing  together, 
Guha  approaching,  said  with  humility :  "  O  Prince,  didst  thou 
rest  at  ease,  on  the  river  bank  ?  Did  any  disturbance  visit  thee 
or  thine  army  ?  " 

Hearing  these  words  of  Guha  uttered  with  affection,  Shri 
Bharata  answered  him,  saving  :  "  O  King,  we  have  passed  this 
night  in  peace,  having  been  highly  honoured  by  thee.  Now 
let  thy  servants  convey  our  army  over  the  river." 

Guha  hastily  returned  to  his  city  and  spake  thus  to  his  servants 
and  relatives :  "  Brothers,  arise,  awake,  may  you  ever  be 
fortunate  !  Bring  boats  to  the  bank  and  convey  the  army  over 
the  river ! " 

Thus  addressed,  the  ferrymen  arose  and  gathering  five  hundred 
boats  together,  brought  them  to  the  bank.  A  special  barge  that 
was  seaworthy,  named  "  Swastika  ",  hung  with  large  bells  and 
flying  banners  with  apertures  for  air,  was  also  furnished,  whereon 
white  woollen  rugs  were  spread  like  carpets,  small  bells  tinkling 
melodiously  when  it  sailed.  This  barque  was  steered  by  Guha 
himself.  On  it  stepped  the  illustrious  Princes  Bharata  and 
Shatrughna  with  the  Queens  Kaushalya  and  Sumitra,  and  other 
ladies  of  high  degree,  preceded  by  their  spiritual  preceptors,  the 
priests  and  learned  brahmins  ;  finally,  the  baggage  was  loaded. 

At  the  time  of  departure,  the  noise  of  those  burning  the  residue 
left  by  the  army,  of  those  who  plunged  into  the  holy  Ganges 
end  the  porters  bearing  the  baggage,  ascended  to  the  sky.  The 
347 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

boats,  crowded  with  attendants,  guarded  by  picked  ferrymen, 
sailing  swiftly,  conveyed  them  over  the  river.  Many  vessels 
contained  women  only,  while  others  were  rilled  with  horses  or 
bullocks,  carts,  cattle  and  mules. 

Reaching  the  other  bank  of  the  river,  the  people  disembarked, 
the  ferrymen  and  Guha's  relatives  playing  diverse  games  in  the 
water  as  they  returned.  Some  of  the  elephants,  resembling 
mountains  as  they  moved,  were  driven  across  by  their  mahouts, 
others  crossed  in  boats,  some  on  rafts  and  some  swam.  Guha's 
servants  ferried  the  army  over  the  river,  before  taking  their 
morning  bath.  During  the  period  of  Maitra,  following  on  the 
sunrise,  the  army  crossed  the  sacred  stream  and  entered  the 
charming  forest. 

Arriving  at  holy  Prayaga,  the  magnanimous  Bharata  spoke 
encouraging  words  to  the  army  and  ordered  them  to  camp  at 
ease.  Then  the  prince  accompanied  by  the  Guru  Vasishtha 
and  other  priests,  went  to  see  the  Sage  Bharadwaja. 

Approaching  the  hermitage  of  that  learned  and  illumined  sage, 
the  son  of  Brihaspati,  they  beheld  in  the  dense  and  delightful 
forest,  charming  huts  thatched  with  leaves. 


CHAPTER  90 

Prince  Bharata  with  Shri  Vasishtha  visit  the  Sage  Bharadwaja's 
hermitage 

Bharata,  beholding  the  hermitage  of  the  Sage  Bharadwaja, 
leaving  his  army  a  league  behind  and  laying  aside  his  weapons 
and  royal  apparel,  attired  in  a  simple  silken  garment,  proceeded 
on  foot,  preceded  by  bis  preceptor.  Perceiving  the  sage  himself, 
he  left  his  counsellors  and  followed  Shri  Vasishtha  only.  The 
great  ascetic  Bharadwaja,  beholding  Prince  Bharata  approaching, 
rising  from  his  seat,  commanded  his  disciples  to  bring  the 
arghya.  The  muni  advancing  to  greet  Shri  Vasishtha,  Prince 
Bharata  offered  salutations  to  him,  the  sage  recognizing  him  as 
the  son  of  King  Dasaratha.  The  Sage  Bharadwaja  then  calling 
348 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

for  the  ritual  appointments  presented  them  with  the  arghya, 
and  refreshed  them  with  fruits ;  he  then  enquired  respecting 
their  welfare  and  if  all  were  well  in  Ayodhya.  Then  he  asked 
concerning  the  state  treasury  and  the  ministers,  but,  knowing 
the  king  to  be  dead,  he  made  no  enquiry  concerning  him. 

In  return,  Shri  Vasishtha  and  Bharata  enquired  as  to  the  health 
of  the  sage,  the  state  of  his  body,  the  sacred  fire,  his  disciples, 
the  deer  and  the  birds.  The  great  ascetic  Bharadwaja  informed 
them  respecting  all  these  things  and  then,  prompted  by  the 
affection  he  bore  for  Shri  Rama,  said  to  Bharata  :  "  O  Prince, 
what  occasion  has  brought  thee  hither,  who  art  now  the  ruler 
of  the  kingdom  ?  Tell  me  all.  King  Dasaratha,  urged  by  his 
consort,  banished  Prince  Rama  to  the  forest,  for  the  period 
of  fourteen  years.  I  trust  that  thou,  desirous  of  enjoying  the 
kingdom  without  reserve,  art  not  the  harbourer  of  ill-will  to 
thy  brother  ?  " 

Bitterly  wounded  by  the  rishi's  words,  Prince  Bharata,  his  eyes 
suffused  with  tears,  his  throat  choked  with  emotion,  said: 
"  O  Lord,  thou  art  all-knowing,  if  thou  dost  thus  regard  me, 
then  my  life  is  vain.  I  am  in  no  way  implicated  in  the  fate 
of  Shri  Rama.  Such  villainy  would  never  proceed  from  me. 
O  My  Lord,  why  dost  thou  charge  me  thus  ?  That  which 
my  mother  has  done,  on  my  account,  is  not  approved  by  me, 
nor  should  I  ever  condone  it.  I  go  to  gratify  that  great  prince, 
by  offering  salutations  to  him  and  with  the  intention  of  bringing 
him  back  to  the  capital.  O  Divine  One,  this  is  my  purpose, 
be  pleased  to  tell  me  where  Rama,  now  the  lord  of  the  earth, 
is  to  be  found  ?  " 

Requested  likewise  by  Shri  Vasishtha  and  the  other  priests, 
Shri  Bharadwaja,  captivated  by  the  words  of  Bharata,  answered : 
"  O  Great  One,  thou  art  born  in  the  illustrious  family  of  Raghu, 
and  it  is  therefore  not  a  source  of  wonder  that  dutiful  regard 
for  thy  preceptor,  self-control  and  the  following  of  the  path 
of  the  wise,  are  all  united  in  thee !  By  my  yogic  powers,  the 
contents  of  thy  heart  were  known  to  me,  but  I  questioned  thee, 
that  thy  resolution  might  be  established,  and  thy  fame  proclaimed 
throughout  the  whole  world.  It  is  known  to  me  where  Shri 
Rama  and  Lakshmana  conversant  with  righteousness,  abide. 
They  dwell  on  the  great  mountain  Chittrakuta ;  do  thou  go 
349 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

thither  to-morrow.    To-day,  stay  here  with  thy  counsellors. 
O  Wise  One,  do  thou  accede  to  my  request." 

Then  Bharata,  the  prince  of  great  renown,  accepted  the  offer 
of  the  sage  and  remained  all  that  night  at  his  hermitage. 


CHAPTER    91 

Sage  Bharadwaja  entertains  the  whole  army 

Prince  Bharata,  having  decided  to  remain  in  the  hermitage, 
the  sage  invited  him  to  a  repast.  Shri  Bharata  said :  "  O  Holy 
Lord,  thou  hast  already  entertained  me  with  water,  fruit  and 
berries,  I  am  wholly  satisfied.*' 

Shri  Bharadwaja  smilingly  answered :  "  I  know  thee  to  be 
pleased  with  whatever  is  lovingly  offered  to  thee,  but,  O  Prince, 
I  desire  to  entertain  thy  whole  army,  it  is  meet  that  thou  accede 
to  my  request.  O  Great  Prince,  why  art  thou  come,  leaving 
thine  army  at  a  distance  ?  Why  didst  thou  come  unattended 
by  thine  army  ?  " 

Hearing  these  words,  Prince  Bharata  answered  with  humility : 
"  O  Lord,  I  did  not  come  attended  by  mine  army,  in  deference 
to  thee.  It  becomes  a  king  or  a  king's  son  to  protect  the 
hermitages  of  his  kingdom  1  O  Lord  !  I  am  accompanied  by 
many  horses  and  wild  elephants  occupying  a  vast  area.  Fearing 
lest  they  should  destroy  the  trees,  the  thatched  huts  and  defile 
the  water  of  the  ponds  and  wells,  I  came  alone,  leaving  them 
behind." 

Then  the  Maharishi  Bharadwaja  said :  "  Bring  thine  army 
hither." 

Thus  commanded,  the  prince  brought  his  army  thither. 
Entering  the  sacrificial  pavilion,  the  rishi  drank  three  times  of 
the  water  there,  and  reciting  a  certain  formula,  sprinkled  some 
on  his  body.  Then  invoking  Vishwakarma1  to  provide  the 
entertainment,  and  speaking  slowly,  he  said :  "  I  summon  the 
celestial  beings,  Vishwakarma  and  Twashta,  let  them  prepare 

1  Vixhwakarma— the  architect  of  the  god*. 

350 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

dwellings  for  the  army.  I  desire  to  offer  Prince  Bharata 
hospitality,  I  therefore  call  upon  the  deities  Yama,  Varuna, 
Kuvera  and  also  Indra.  Let  them  assist  me  in  providing  the 
entertainment.  I  also  summon  all  the  rivers,  flowing  above 
or  below  from  east  to  west  and  from  west  to  east.  Let  some 
of  these  produce  the  delicious  wine  named  Maireya1  and  that 
named  Saura>2  and  also  cool,  sweet  water,  like  the  juice  of  the 
sugar  cane.  I  summon  further  the  heavenly  musicians  called 
Haha  and  Huhu,  together  with  other  divine  beings  and  nymphs. 
I  summon  the  dancing  apsaras,  Ghritachi,  Vishwachi,  Mishra- 
keshi,  Alambusha,  Nagadanta,  Hema  and  Soma,  who  dwell  in 
the  Himalayas.  I  call  on  the  dancing  nymphs  attendant  on 
Brahma  and  Indra;  let  them  attire  themselves  in  beautiful 
apparel,  bringing  their  instruments.  I  desire  the  celestial  forest 
Chaitraratha  to  appear  here,  the  leaves  of  whose  trees  are  formed 
like  beautiful  damsels.  I  desire  further  foods  of  many  kinds 
that  can  be  chewed,  sucked  or  licked,  and  various  drinks  to  be 
prepared  by  the  deity  presiding  over  the  moon.  Let  garlands 
of  fresh  flowers  be  made  ready  and  beautiful  goblets  and  different 
dishes  of  flesh  be  produced  here  instantaneously !  " 

By  his  yogic  power  and  the  proper  recitation  of  the  sacred 
mantras,  the  holy  Sage  Bharadwaja  produced  all  that  was 
necessary.  Facing  the  east  in  the  posture  of  invitation,  Shri 
Bharadwaja  sat  in  meditation  for  a  space.  Then,  one  by  one, 
the  gods  appeared  before  him.  The  cool,  slow  and  fragrant 
breezes  blowing  from  the  Malaya  and  Dadura  mountains, 
tempered  the  heat.  The  clouds  rained  down  flowers  and  the 
sound  of  the  divine  dundubhis  (drums)  was  heard ;  delightful 
zephyrs  began  to  blow,  nymphs  danced,  the  celestial  musicians 
sang  and  the  notes  of  the  vina  were  heard  everywhere.  The  earth 
and  the  sky  were  filled  with  sweet  and  harmonious  sounds, 
heard  by  all  living  beings.  As  the  divine  music  continued, 
Bharata's  army  beheld  the  wonderful  structure  wrought  by 
Vishwakarma.  They  perceived  the  whole  area  within  a  radius 
of  four  miles,  to  be  covered  with  a  carpet  of  green  and  glistening 
grass  sparkling  like  a  green  emerald.    Its  beauty  was  enhanced

by  silwa,1  kapitha,1  amlaki1  and  mango  trees.  A  wood  appeared 
wherein  people  could  wander,  also  a  divine  stream  flowing 
between  banks  adorned  by  various  trees.  Beautiful  white 
mansions  were  erected,  with  stables  for  elephants  and  horses. 
Palaces  with  their  balconies  decorated  with  leaves  and  flowers 
were  to  be  seen,  and  others  adorned  with  green  and  flowery 
sprays  and  garlands  of  pure  white  blossoms  sprinkled  with 
scented  water.  These  dwellings  contained  square  courts 
serving  as  reception  halls  with  space  for  palanquins,  and  coaches. 
Food  of  all  kinds,  rice,  the  juice  of  sugar  cane  and  every  variety 
of  confection  was  to  be  found  there,  with  curry  puffs,  pancakes 
and  other  delicious  dishes  served  in  clean  vessels,  while  excellent 
carpets  and  seats  were  spread  for  relaxation,  and  couches  with 
spotless  coverings  and  quilts. 

Entering  these  mansions  with  the  permission  of  the  Sage 
Bharadwaja,  Prince  Bharata  was  followed  by  his  servants, 
ministers  and  priests  who,  perceiving  all  to  be  well  furnished, 
were  highly  gratified. 

In  one  of  the  mansions,  a  room  was  set  apart  containing 
a  throne  where  retainers  holding  the  canopy  and  chamara  were 
in  attendance.  Bharata  with  his  ministers,  circumambulated 
the  royal  dais  as  if  it  were  occupied  by  Shri  Rama  and  bowing 
to  it  respectfully,  Shri  Bharata,  holding  the  chamara,  occupied 
a  lower  seat,  the  counsellors,  priests  and  army  commanders 
assuming  positions  in  accordance  with  their  respective  rank. 

Now,  at  the  command  of  the  holy  sage,  streams  of  milk, 
thickened  with  rice,  flowed  before  Bharata's  eyes.  Beautiful 
houses,  washed  with  quicklime,  appeared  on  the  river  banks. 
Twenty  thousand  youthful  women,  enchantingly  attired  and 
wearing  beautiful  ornaments  came  there  at  the  instance  of 
Brahma.  Kuvera  also  sent  twenty  thousand  lovely  damsels 
adorned  with  gold,  gems  and  pearls.  Further  twenty  thousand 
nymphs  from  the  region  of  Indra  appeared,  whose  beauty  caused 
men  to  lose  their  reason.  Narada,  Gopha  and  other  brilliant 
musicians  began  to  sing  and  play  before  Bharata,  and  the  celestial 
nymphs  to  dance  in  the  presence  of  the  prince,  at  the  rishi's 
command.  All  the  flowers  most  highly  esteemed  in  the  celestial 
gardens  among  the  gods,  were  seen  at  Prayaga,  through  the  power

35* 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

of  Bharadwaja.  The  trees  applauded,  the  bahadur  tree  per- 
formed on  the  cymbals  and  the  pipal  danced,  through  the 
influence  of  the  sage,  and  those  named  devaparna,  tala  and 
kuraka  assumed  the  form  of  dwarfs  !  Plants  by  the  name  of 
shingsapa,  amalaki  and  jambu,  and  twining  creepers  such  as 
the  jasmine  and  mallika,  taking  on  the  shape  of  women  in  the 
hermitage  of  Bharadwaja,  cried  out :  "  O  Wine-Bibbers,  drink  ! 
O  Hungry  Ones,  eat  kheeva !  Come,  fill  yourselves  with  the 
various  kinds  of  meat !  " 

Each  person  was  bathed  in  the  cool  river  and  attended  by 
seven  or  eight  beautiful  maidens  with  lustrous  eyes,  who 
massaged  their  body  with  oil  and  unguents.  Their  bath 
completed,  many  women  dried  them  with  soft  cloths  and  gave 
them  sweetened  water,  tasting  like  ambrosia,  to  drink. 

The  keepers  attended  carefully  to  the  horses,  elephants, 
mules,  camels  and  bullocks.  Those  steeds  belonging  to  the 
royal  stables  and  ridden  by  great  generals,  were  fed  by  the 
grooms  on  bundles  of  sugar  cane  and  parched  and  sweetened 
rice,  their  attendants  and  mahouts  could  hardly  recognize  their 
charges.  The  soldiery  were  now  intoxicated  with  wine  and 
indulging  in  every  pleasure !  Each  was  gratified  in  whatever 
he  desired ;  their  bodies  anointed  with  sandalwood  paste  and 
united  with  the  nymphs  in  amorous  dalliance,  they  exclaimed : 
"  We  will  neither  go  to  Ayodhya  nor  enter  the  Dandaka 
forest !  Let  Bharata  live  at  ease  and  Shri  Rama  dwell  in  the 
forest !  ** 

Thus  did  the  warriors  and  grooms  express  themselves  in  the 
state  of  inebriation,  while  thousands  of  soldiers,  in  exultation, 
shouted  aloud :  "  Verily,  this  is  heaven  !  "  Running  hither 
and  thither  with  garlands  round  their  necks,  innumerable  soldiers 
danced,  sang  and  laughed.  Though  they  had  partaken  to  the 
full  of  excellent  dishes,  sweet  as  nectar,  yet  when  they  perceived 
fresh  articles  of  food,  they  could  not  restrain  themselves  from 
eating  anew ! 

Thousands  of  messengers,  servants  and  the  wives  of  the 
soldiery,  putting  on  colourful  raiment,  displayed  themselves 
with  pride.  Elephants,  horses,  camels,  deer  and  birds  were 
fully  satisfied ;  none  wanted  for  anything !  No  one,  in  the 
army  of  Bharata,  was  seen  in  soiled  garments  or  hungry  or 
353 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

unkempt,  none  was  seen  with  an  unclean  countenance  or 
uncombed  hair ! 

The  men  beheld  countless  dishes  of  mutton,  pork,  venison 
and  other  meats  cooked  in  fruit-juices  and  fried  in  butter  with 
cloves,  caraway  seeds  and  lentils  simmering  gently  in  them. 
Thousands  of  vessels  were  filled  with  spiced  rice,  garnished 
with  flowers  and  flags.  All  were  speechless  with  wonder  on 
beholding  them  !  Within  a  radius  of  five  miles,  the  wells  were 
filled  with  frumenty  (kheeva)  and  cows  like  Kamadhenu  fulfilled 
every  desire  I  The  trees  dripped  honey  and  the  lakes  were  filled 
with  the  sparkling  wine  Maireya,  and  banked  with  dressed 
viands  such  as  deer,  chickens  and  peacocks.  Hundreds  and 
thousands  of  dishes  were  provided,  and  myriads  of  vessels  filled 
with  curds,  mixed  with  caraway  seeds,  ginger  and  other  fragrant 
spices,  were  served  there.  Lakes  of  yoghourt  and  milk,  together 
with  heaps  of  sugar,  were  to  be  seen  on  the  river  banks,  as  also 
fragrant  crushed  leaves  and  unguents  with  large  pots  of  sandal- 
wood paste,  mirrors  and  towels  !  An  abundance  of  sandals 
and  shoes  were  provided,  whilst  antimony,  combs,  brushes, 
parasols,  bows  and  quivers,  armour  and  ornamental  seats  were 
placed  here  and  there !  Tanks,  full  of  liquid  mixed  with  herbs 
to  promote  digestion,  were  taken  to  the  banks  of  lakes  where 
descent  was  easy,  and  where  the  people  could  bathe  freely  and 
drink  when  they  pleased !  These  lakes  were  filled  with  pure 
water,  abounding  in  lotuses  and  fringed  with  tender  grass  of 
blue  and  emerald  hue ;  here,  resting  places  for  the  beasts  were 
also  to  be  found. 

Prince  Bharata's  companions  were  astounded  at  the  entertain- 
ment provided  by  the  Maharishi  Bharadwaja.  All  passed  the 
night  in  amusement,  as  in  the  garden  of  Indra ! 

At  dawn,  the  rivers,  celestial  musicians  and  nymphs  took  leave 
of  the  maharishi  and  returned  to  their  own  abode.  But  Prince 
Bharata's  followers  were  still  flushed  and  inebriated,  their  bodies 
painted  with  sandalwood,  the  flower  garlands  in  heaps  like 
mountains,  lying  everywhere,  scattered  and  trampled  on  by  men 
and  beasts.

AYODHYA    KANDA 

CHAPTER     92 

Prince  Bharata  with  the  army  departs  for  Mount  Chittrakuta 

Prince  Bharata,  having  passed  the  night  in  enjoyment  of  the 
entertainment  provided,  early  in  the  morning,  desirous  of  seeing 
Rama,  approached  the  muni. 

With  joined  palms,  he  stood  before  the  holy  rishi  who  was 
engaged  in  the  fire  ritual. 

The  Sage  Bharadwaja  enquired  of  him,  saying  :  "  O  Sinless 
Prince,  didst  thou  pass  the  night  in  my  hermitage  in  peace  ? 
Are  all  satisfied  with  the  meagre  entertainment  provided  by 
me?" 

Shri  Bharata,  offering  salutations  to  the  maharishi,  who  had 
come  out  from  his  hermitage  replied  :  "  0  Blessed  Lord,  I  and 
my  whole  army  have  been  rendered  completely  happy  in  thy 
hermitage,  thou  hast  fully  satisfied  us  all.  My  people  have 
passed  the  night  agreeably,  they  have  slept  in  excellent  houses 
and  partaken  of  delicious  dishes,  and  have  lost  all  sense  of 
the  fatigue  caused  by  the  journey.  O  Great  Sage,  now  allow 
me  to  take  leave  of  thee  and  go  to  my  brother ;  look  on  me  with 
favour,  I  beg  of  the™,.  O  Wise  One,  how  far  from  here  is  the 
hermitage  of  the  pious  Rama  and  which  is  the  way  thither  ?  " 

The  sage,  eminent  in  ascetic  practices,  replied  to  Bharata, 
who  desired  to  see  his  brother :  "  O  Prince,  at  ten  miles'  distance 
from  here,  in  a  field  full  of  boulders,  is  the  beautiful  mountain 
named  Chittrakuta  !  To  the  north  of  that  mountain  flows  the 
river  Mandakini,  winding  through  flowery  forests,  its  banks 
planted  with  blossoming  trees.  O  Friend,  close  to  that  river, 
on  the  Chittrakuta  mountain,  thou  shalt  find  thy  two  brothers 
dwelling  in  a  thatched  hut.  O  Fortunate  Prince,  on  the  southern 
bank  of  the  Yamuna,  thou  wilt  see  two  paths,  do  thou  take 
the  right  path  with  thine  army,  horses  and  elephants  I  This 
path  will  take  thee  to  Shri  Rama." 

At  the  moment  of  departure  the  consorts  of  King  Dasaratha, 
descending  from  their  chariots,  came  to  the  place  where  the 
great  sage  was  and  stood  encircling  him.  Among  them  the  frail 
355 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  trembling  Kaushalya  and  Sumitra  touched  the  feet  of  the 
holy  man.  Then  Kaikeyi,  thwarted  in  her  designs  and  despised 
by  the  whole  world,  touched  the  feet  of  the  sage  and  circum- 
ambulated him.  Grief-stricken,  she  stood  at  a  little  distance 
from  Bfaarata,  as  the  holy  Bharadwaja  addressed  the  prince, 
saying :  "  O  Prince,  I  desire  to  be  acquainted  with  thy  mothers." 

The  ever  eloquent  Bharata  answered  humbly :  "  O  Holy 
Lord,  here  is  my  father's  chief  queen,  wretched  and  weakened 
through  fasting,  yet  resembling  a  goddess.  She  is  the  mother 
of  that  Lion  among  men,  the  highly  intrepid  Prince  Rama ! 
Comparable  to  Aditi  who  brought  forth  Prajapati,  she  has 
given  birth  to  Raghava  !  She,  who  leaning  on  her  arm,  stands 
with  a  sorrowful  heart,  like  the  branch  of  the  karnikara  tree 
stripped  of  its  flowers,  is  the  Queen  Sumitra,  the  mother  of 
those  heroes  of  truth,  Shri  Lakshmana  and  Shatrughna.  O 
Great  Sage,  she  who  has  brought  great  affliction  on  these  two 
chiefs  of  men  and  caused  the  death  of  King  Dasaratha  by 
separating  him  from  his  sons,  who  is  given  to  anger  and  who 
is  vain  and  shallow,  esteeming  herself  favoured,  who  is  highly 
ambitious  and  fickle  and  yet  looks  upon  herself  as  free  from 
imperfection,  that  cruel  and  wicked  Kaikeyi,  is  my  mother !  O 
Great  Muni,  it  is  she  who  has  caused  my  great  misfortune ! " 

Unable  to  utter  further,  his  throat  choked  with  emotion,  the 
prince  began  to  sigh  heavily,  his  eyes  inflamed,  breathing  like 
a  provoked  serpent.  Then  the  holy  sage,  acquainted  with  what 
should  come  to  pass,  answered  saying :  "  My  Son,  do  not 
reproach  Queen  Kaikeyi,  the  exile  of  Shri  Rama  will  be 
productive  of  great  good  and  the  gods  and  danavas  and  the 
illustrious  sages  will  gain  great  benefit  from  the  presence  of 
Shri  Rama  in  the  forest  1 " 

Hearing  this,  Bharata  bowed  low  to  the  rishi  and  receiving 
his  blessing,  circumambulated  him  with  reverence.  Then  craving 
permission  from  the  sage  to  depart,  he  ordered  his  army  to 
prepare  to  march. 

The  leaders  of  the  forces  mounted  their  horses,  while  others, 
ascending  golden  chariots,  started  on  their  journey.  Elephants 
with  howdahs  fixed  by  golden  chains  and  adorned  with  fluttering 
flags  went  forward,  the  bells  hanging  from  the  male  and  female 
tuskers  causing  a  sound  like  the  thunder  of  the  clouds  at  the  end 
35« 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

of  the  rainy  season !    The  other  vehicles  large  and  small, 

conveying  members  of  the  royal  family  advanced  also. 

Shri  Bharata,  intent  on  seeing  Rama,  riding  in  a  resplendent 
palanquin  shining  like  the  sun  or  moon,  with  his  great  army, 
moved  towards  the  south,  covering  the  earth  like  a  vast  cloud. 

The  horses  and  elephants  were  all  contented  and  the  vast 
concourse  inspiring  the  wild  deer  and  birds  with  terror,  looked 
splendid  as  it  entered  the  deep  forest. 


chapter  93 

They  behold  the  hermitage  of  Shri  Rama 

As  the  mighty  army  traversed  the  forest,  the  leaders  of  the  herds 
of  wild  elephants  with  their  companions,  ran  away  in  alarm. 
Bears,  leopards  and  other  fierce  beasts  could  be  seen  fleeing 
on  the  hilltops  and  by  the  banks  of  the  river. 

Supremely  gratified,  Prince  Bharata  proceeded  in  the  midst 
of  his  soldiers  who  shouted  as  they  marched.  The  army  of 
the  illustrious  Bharata,  resembled  an  ocean,  whose  waves  spread 
over  the  earth  or  like  the  clouds  covering  the  sky  during  the 
rainy  season.  The  ground  for  miles  was  covered  with  elephants 
and  horses,  so  that  no  trace  of  it  could  be  seen. 

Having  marched  a  considerable  distance,  Shri  Bharata, 
perceiving  his  animals  to  be  fatigued,  addressed  the  holy  priest, 
Shri  Vasishtha,  saying:  "This  country  appears  to  be  as 
beautiful  as  described  to  me,  I  deem  that  we  have  reached  that 
place  spoken  of  by  the  Sage  Bharadwaja.  This  mountain  is 
Chittrakuta,  and  this  is  the  Mandakini  river,  and  this  is  the 
forest  which,  from  a  distance,  resembled  a  blue  cloud.  These 
are  the  glorious  peaks  of  Chittrakuta,  which  are  being  trodden 
by  my  great  elephants  !  See,  O  Holy  Guru,  as  the  dark  clouds 
pour  down  water  in  the  rainy  season,  so  do  the  elephants, 
whose  trunks  are  scarred  by  the  waving  branches  of  the  trees, 
scatter  flowers  on  the  hills. 

"O  Shatrughna,  behold  the  lovely  Chittrakuta  mountain 
357 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

sought  after  by  the  gods ;  everywhere  herds  of  deer  wander 
about  enhancing  its  beauty,  like  crocodiles  swimming  gracefully 
in  the  sea.  As  clouds  driven  by  the  wind  in  winter  adorn  the 
sky,  so  do  these  deer  running  before  the  army,  render  the  forest 
delightful. 

"  Our  soldiers  decorating  their  heads  with  flowers,  resemble 
the  people  of  the  south  who  crown  themselves  with  blossoms. 
See,  O  Shatrughna,  the  forest  that  appeared  terrifying  and 
seemed  to  breathe  by  being  filled  with  men,  resembles  Ayodhya 
itself! 

"  The  dust  rising  from  the  hoofs  of  the  bullocks  covers  the  sky 
and  settles  there,  till  the  wind  quickly  dispels  it,  as  if  those 
things  obstructing  my  vision  of  Shri  Rama  were  being  removed 
from  my  eyes.  O  Shatrughna,  behold  these  horses  yoked  to 
the  chariots  with  their  charioteers,  swiftly  passing  through  the 
forest !  And  see  those  beautiful  peacocks  with  long  feathers, 
running  in  fear  towards  their  habitation  on  the  mountain.  O 
Sinless  Brother,  this  place  appears  enchanting  to  me  and  a  fit 
abode  for  ascetics. 

"  How  lovely  are  the  spotted  deer  wandering  about  with  their 
hinds ;  they  appear  as  if  studded  with  flowers.  Let  my  leaders 
go  forward  and  seek  out  the  place  where  Shri  Rama  and 
Lakshmana  dwell." 

Hearing  the  words  of  Shri  Bharata,  the  warriors  bearing 
weapons  in  their  hands,  entered  the  forest  and  there  perceived 
a  spot  where  smoke  was  ascending.  On  beholding  this,  they 
returned  to  Prince  Bharata  and  communicated  to  him  their 
belief,  that  the  two  royal  brothers  dwelt  where  the  smoke  arose. 
They  said  :  "  If  it  be  not  Shri  Rama  and  Lakshmana  yonder, 
then  surely  it  is  some  devotee  who  can  inform  us  concerning  the 
dwelling  place  of  Raghava ! " 

Hearing  this  pleasing  report,  Shri  Bharata  addressed  the 
leaders  of  the  army  saying :  "  Do  you  remain  here,  do  not 
proceed  further,  I,  with  the  holy  Guru  Vasishtha  and  Sumantra 
will  go  forward  to  that  place." 

Thus  commanded  the  warriors  halted  and  Shri  Bharata 
looked  towards  the  spot  where  the  smoke  was  visible.  Observing 
the  smoke,  the  warriors,  waiting  at  that  place,  rejoiced,  believing 
the  time  for  the  meeting  with  Shri  Rama  was  at  hand.

CHAPTER    94 

Shri  Rama  decides  to  spend  his  exile  on  the  mountain 

Shri  Rama  who  had  passed  many  days  on  that  mountain, 
gratified  Shri  Sita  by  showing  her  many  scenes  of  natural  beauty, 
they  themselves  appearing  as  lovely  as  Indra  and  bis  consort. 

Shri  Rama  said :  "  O  Fortunate  One,  beholding  the  beauty 
of  this  pleasant  mountain,  no  longer  does  the  separation  from 
my  friends  or  my  country  cause  me  pain  !  O  Centre  of  Delight ! 
behold  the  loveliness  of  these  peaks  abounding  in  metals  of 
various  kinds,  reaching  the  skies  and  frequented  by  birds  of 
every  species  !  These  peaks,  some  of  which  shine  like  silver, 
some  of  which  are  ruddy,  some  yellow,  some  glittering  with 
the  splendour  of  the  brilliant  gems  concealed  in  them ;  some 
sparkling  with  sapphire  and  crystal,  and  some  resembling  quick- 
silver and  glittering  like  the  stars !  Though  many  lions  and 
leopards  abound  in  the  forest,  yet  influenced  by  the  pure  nature 
of  the  ascetics  dwelling  here,  they  have  ceased  to  follow  their 
cruel  instincts.  Many  varieties  of  birds  have  their  nests  on 
yonder  hill,  trees  laden  with  fruit  and  flowers  affording  delightful 
shade,  render  the  mountain  enchanting  ! 

"  Here  are  mango,  jambu,  asana,  lohdra,  piyala,  panasa, 
dhuva,  ankotha,  bhavya,  tinisha,  bilwa,  tindura,  bamboo, 
kasanari,  arista,  varana,  madhuca,  tilaka,  vadari,  amlaka,  nipa, 
vetra,  dhanwaria,  vijaka  and  other  trees. 

"  O  Auspicious  Princess,  behold  the  ravishing  loveliness  of 
these  hills  where  the  wise  kinneras  wander  in  pairs,  their 
swords  and  coloured  apparel  hanging  on  the  branches.  See  the 
charming  retreats  of  the  vidya  dharas1  and  their  companions. 
These  mountains  with  their  cascades  and  bubbling  springs 
appear  like  mighty  elephants  the  ichor  flowing  from  their 
foreheads. 

"  What  mind  would  not  be  filled  with  delight  by  the  breezes 
issuing  from  the  caves  of  the  mountain,  redolent  with  fragrance, 
pleasing  to  the  senses  ?    O  Peerless  One,  if  it  be  for  me  to

359 


THE  RAMAYANA   OF  VALMIKI 

dwell  here  with  thee  and  Lakshmana  for  innumerable  years, 
no  grief  or  anxiety  will  visit  me.  O  Lovely  Lady,  on  the 
mountain  of  Chittrakuta,  rendered  pleasant  by  a  profusion  of 
flowers  and  fruits,  whose  delightful  peaks  echo  with  the  sweet 
song  of  birds,  I  am  content  to  dwell !  By  residing  here,  two 
objects  have  been  achieved,  the  fulfilment  of  my  father's  vow 
and  the  satisfaction  of  Prince  Bharata.  O  Daughter  of  King 
Videha,  behold  this  enchanting  spot  where  self-control  and 
asceticism  are  easily  exercised.  Say,  art  thou  happy  here? 
The  discipline  of  residence  in  the  forest  is  declared  by  royal 
sages  to  be  a  means  to  liberation.  Our  ancestors  such  as  Manu 
have  held  that  residence  in  the  forest  is  the  means  of  acquiring 
the  form  of  the  gods.  Behold,  O  Princess,  yonder  mountain, 
adorned  by  thousands  of  rocks  blue,  yellow,  purple  and  white. 
At  night,  the  healing  herbs  shine  like  fire,  lighting  the  crags 
with  their  radiance.  See,  O  Princess,  some  of  the  caves 
resemble  houses,  some  appear  like  flower  gardens,  all  enhancing 
the  glory  of  the  mountain.  It  would  seem  that  Chittrakuta 
has  sprung  forth  from  the  earth  and  from  every  side  appears 
incomparably  beautiful.  Observe,  O  Auspicious  One,  how 
those  devoted  to  pleasure,  have  spread  couches  here  and  there, 
and  covered  them  with  azure  lotuses  overlaid  with  coverings 
of  bark.  See  the  faded  garlands  cast  aside  by  them  and  the  rinds 
of  many  fruits  of  which  they  have  partaken. 

"  This  mountain  Chittrakuta,  in  variety  of  flowers  and  trans- 
parent waters,  has  surpassed  the  capital  of  Indra  in  loveliness. 
O  Sita,  I  will  pass  the  twelve  years  here  with  Prince  Lakshmana 
and  thee ;  pursuing  the  highest  virtue  and  discipline,  I  shall 
thus  protect  my  kingdom  and  earn  merit." 


chapter   95 

He  points  out  the  beauties  of  nature  to  Sita 

Having  pointed  out  the  beauty  of  the  hills  to  Sita,  Raghava 

now  showed  her  the  pleasant  river  Mandakini  issuing  from 

the  mountain.    The  lotus-eyed  Lord  addressed  the  daughter 

360 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

of  King  Janata,  whose  countenance  resembled  the  moon, 
saying :  "  O  Princess,  behold  the  river  Mandakini  with  its 
delightful  banks  frequented  by  swans,  cranes  and  other  water- 
fowl, abounding  in  flowering  trees  of  different  kinds,  which 
cause  it  to  resemble  the  river  Sangandhika  in  the  region  of 
Kuvera.  Its  pleasant  fords,  where  I  desire  to  bathe,  the  waters 
of  which  have  been  rendered  muddy  by  the  herds  of  deer  who 
have  come  to  drink  and  recently  departed,  all  these  attract  the 
heart.  O  Dear  One,  the  ascetics  attired  in  robes  of  bark  and 
deerskin,  bathe  at  stated  seasons  in  this  river.  O  Princess 
of  beautiful  eyes,  here  the  munis  observing  strict  and  austere 
vows,  stand  with  uplifted  arms,  worshipping  the  sun.  The 
trees  agitated  by  the  breeze,  cause  the  hills  to  appear  as  if  they 
were  dancing.  The  blossoms  scattered  by  the  force  of  the  wind 
make  it  seem  as  if  Chittrakuta  were  offering  flowers  to  the  river. 
O  Auspicious  One,  here  the  waters  of  Mandakini  sparkle  like 
gems  and  there  they  form  a  sandy  beach.  Groups  of  perfect 
beings  frequent  the  banks.  O  Princess,  behold  the  heaps  of 
flowers  shaken  down  from  the  branches  by  the  wind,  and  others 
floating  through  the  air  and  falling  into  the  river  to  be  carried 
away  by  the  water.  O  Kalyani,  behold  the  wild  geese  standing 
in  the  shallows,  uttering  sweet  cries  to  summon  their  mates 
or  diverting  themselves  with  them.  O  Lovely  Sita,  when  I 
behold  the  Chittrakuta  mountain  and  the  river  Mandakini  in 
company  with  thee,  I  esteem  it  a  greater  joy  than  any  Ayodhya 
could  yield  me.  Come,  O  Sita,  and  let  us  two  bathe  in  the 
river  Mandakini,  frequented  by  perfect  beings  who  are  endowed 
with  inner  and  outer  control  and  are  devoted  to  the  practice  of 
austerity.  O  Princess,  thou  didst  formerly  play  with  thy  maids 
of  honour  in  Ayodhya,  to-day  amuse  thyself  with  me  in  the 
Mandakini  river,  pelting  me  with  red  and  white  lotuses  and 
splashing  the  waters  over  me.  O  Dear  One,  imagine  those 
dwelling  here  to  be  the  citizens  of  Ayodhya  and  the  Mandakini 
to  be  the  river  Sarayu.  O  Sita,  I  am  happy  with  thee,  who  art 
obedient  to  my  command  as  is  also  Prince  Lakshmana.  O 
Beloved,  bathing  thrice  a  day  with  thee  in  the  river  and  living 
on  honey,  fruits  and  berries,  I  feel  no  desire  for  the  comforts 
of  the  kingdom  of  Ayodhya.  Who  will  not  be  happy,  dwelling 
on  the  banks  of  the  river  Mandakini,  where  herds  of  elephants 
3«i

wander  and  lions  and  monkeys  come  to  quench  their  thirst; 
and  where  flowers  grow  throughout  the  year  ?  " 

Thus  Shri  Rama  conversed  on  many  wondrous  things 
concerning  the  Mandakini  river  with  Sita  and  taking  the  hand 
of  the  princess,  wandered  with  her  over  the  blue  and  beautiful 
Cbittrakuta  mountain.

Having  shown  Sita  the  beauties  of  the  river  Mandakini,  Rama 
and  Sita  seated  themselves  on  a  rock.  Feasting  Videhi1  with 
venison,  Shri  Rama,  in  order  to  please  her,  spoke  in  this  wise : 
"  This  meat  is  pure  and  is  rendered  delicious  by  being  roasted 
in  the  fire." 

While  thus  conversing  with  Sita,  he  observed  the  dust  rising 
like  a  cloud,  stirred  up  by  the  feet  of  the  approaching  army 
of  Bharata  and  heard  the  tramp  of  marching  warriors  at  the 
sound  of  which  the  leaders  of  the  elephants  with  their  herds, 
ran  hither  and  thither  in  agitation.  Seeing  the  herds  of  elephants 
fleeing  at  the  tumult  caused  by  the  army,  Shri  Rama  said  to 
Lakshmana :  "  O  Lakshmana,  Queen  Sumitra  is  fortunate  indeed 
to  be  thy  mother.  Is  this  warlike  clamour  issuing  from  the 
clouds  ?  The  herds  of  elephants  dwelling  in  the  dense  forest, 
the  wild  buffaloes  and  the  deer  are  fleeing  away  in  terror ! 
Has  any  king  or  prince  come  to  hunt  in  the  woods,  or  has 
some  terrible  and  bloodthirsty  beast  entered  the  forest  ?  Enquire 
into  the  matter,  O  Lakshmana !  Even  the  birds  are  not  carefree 
in  their  flight ;  it  becomes  thee  to  seek  out  the  cause  of  this 
commotion." 

Speedily  climbing  a  shala  tree,  Shri  Lakshmana  looked  in  all 
directions.  First  he  examined  the  eastern  quarter,  then  he  looked 

1  Videhi — a  name  of  Sita,  as  daughter  of  the  King  of  Vidcha. 
362 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

towards  the  north  and  there  he  beheld  a  vast  army  composed 
of  elephants,  horses,  chariots  and  well-armed  infantry ! 

Describing  the  approaching  army  with  its  elephants,  horses, 
chariots  and  flags,  Shri  Lakshmana  said  to  Rama :  "  O  Great 
One,  put  out  the  fire  and  let  Sita  enter  the  cave,  do  thou 
arm  thyself  and  take  up  thy  bow  and  arrow." 

Shri  Rama  answered  Lakshmana  saying :  "  O  Child,  ascertain 
by  the  symbols  on  the  flags  to  whom  this  army  belongs." 

The  prince  listened  to  Rama's  words  and  burning  with  anger 
desirous  of  consuming  the  army,  replied :  "  Without  doubt, 
Bharata,  having  secured  the  throne  has  come  to  slay  us  both 
in  order  to  enjoy  rulership,  unopposed !  See,  by  that  large 
and  beautiful  tree  is  a  chariot  with  a  white  flag  bearing  the  sign 
of  a  pomegranate  tree.  The  soldiers  mounted  on  swift  moving 
horses  are  coming  towards  me.  I  see  the  riders  on  elephants 
also.  O  Hero,  let  us  both,  armed  with  bows  and  arrows,  climb 
the  hill,  or  clad  in  battle  array,  stand  here  fully  prepared.  We 
shall  surely  defeat  Bharata.  To-day,  we  shall  subdue  him  on 
whose  account  all  our  sufferings  have  come  to  pass.  O  Rama, 
that  Bharata,  on  whose  account,  thou,  Sita  and  I,  have  been 
deprived  of  our  kingdom  and  cast  into  tribulation,  is  approaching 
like  an  enemy.  He  must  certainly  be  slain,  O  Prince,  I  see 
no  sin  in  destroying  him.  It  were  no  sin  to  slay  one  who  seeks 
to  injure  thee.  O  Prince,  he  has  already  wronged  thee ;  by 
slaying  Bharata,  thou  canst  acquire  mastery  over  the  whole 
earth.  To-day,  Kaikeyi,  avid  for  the  kingdom,  will  see  her  son 
slain  in  the  field.  Seeing  Bharata  slain  by  me,  like  a  tree 
uprooted  by  an  elephant,  Kaikeyi  will  suffer  great  anguish ! 
I  shall  slay  Kaikeyi  also,  and  her  friends  and  Manthara  too.  O 
Bestower  of  Honour,  I  will  free  the  world  of  the  sinful  Kaikeyi ; 
to-day  I  will  let  loose  my  long  restrained  wrath  on  the  forces 
of  mine  enemy,  as  a  fire  consumes  dried  grass.  To-day,  I  will 
drench  the  fields  of  Chittrakuta  with  the  blood  of  mine  enemies. 
To-day,  those  elephants,  wounded  by  my  sharp  arrows  and 
those  men  slain  by  me,  will  be  dragged  hither  and  thither  by 
wild  beasts.  To-day,  I  will  redeem  my  vow,  by  destroying 
Bharata  and  his  army  with  my  bow  and  arrow."

THE    RAMAYAKA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    97 

Shri  Rama  cannot  believe  Prince  Bharata  comes  as  an  enemy 

Seeing  Lakshmana  overcome  with  anger  and  desire  for  ven- 
geance, Shri  Rama  sought  to  pacify  him  saying  :  "  O  Lakshmana, 
the  learned  warrior  Bharata,  fully  armed,  is  coming  to  see  us 
in  person,  of  what  value  is  shield  or  sword  ?  What  should  I  do 
with  a  kingdom  obtained  by  slaying  my  brother  Bharata,  I  having 
undertaken  to  fulfil  my  father's  behests  ?  I  will  never  accept 
riches  obtained  by  the  slaying  of  relatives  and  friends  which 
would  be  as  acceptable  to  me  as  food  mixed  with  poison !  O 
Lakshmana,  I  promise  thee,  it  is  for  the  sake  of  my  brothers 
that  I  desire  to  pursue  virtue,  legitimately  acquired  wealth, 
pleasures,  and  even  the  kingdom.  O  Lakshmana,  I  speak  the 
truth,  by  this  sign,  touching  my  arms, '  I  desire  a  kingdom  only 
for  the  sake  of  supporting  my  brothers  and  securing  their  good  \ 
O  Charming  Prince !  The  acquisition  of  the  kingdom  is  not 
difficult  to  me,  but  O,  My  Brother,  I  do  not  even  desire  dominion 
of  the  celestial  region  if  it  can  only  be  acquired  by  unrighteous 
means  E  O  Dear  One !  May  the  Deity  of  Fire  consume  all 
that  gives  me  joy,  if  it  is  not  for  thy  good  and  to  the  advantage 
of  Bharata  and  Shatrughna !  It  seems  to  me  that  when  my 
dearest  brother,  ever  devoted  to  me,  returned  to  Ayodhya  from 
the  home  of  his  maternal  uncle,  after  hearing  that  we  three, 
robed  in  bark  had  entered  the  forest,  he,  overwhelmed  by 
affection  and  grief,  set  out  hither  to  seek  us !  I  see  no  other 
purpose  for  his  advent  here.  Or  it  may  be  that  Bharata,  wroth 
with  his  mother  has  reproached  her  with  bitter  words  and  has 
come  here  to  be  reconciled  with  me.  It  is  meet  that  Bharata 
should  see  me  and  I  cannot  believe  that  he  comes  as  an  enemy. 
What  harm  has  Bharata  ever  done  to  us,  O  Brother,  that  to-day, 
thou  assumest  him  to  be  against  us  ?  It  is  improper  for  thee 
to  speak  ill  or  harshly  of  Bharata.  Those  bitter  things  thou 
sayest  of  Bharata,  thou  hast  in  fact  said  of  me.  O  Son  of 
Sumitra,  how  should  a  father  slay  his  son,  or  a  brother  slay 
his  brother,  whatever  betide  ?  If  thou  hast  said  all  this  on 
account  of  the  kingdom,  then  I  will  desire  Bharata  to  give  thee 
364 


AYODHYA    KANDA 
the  kingdom.    O  Lakshmana,  if  I  say  to  Bharata  '  Give  the 
crown  to  Lakshmana  *,  assuredly  he  will  answer  '  Be  it  so  V* 

Shii  Lakshmana  was  profoundly  humiliated  by  the  words 
of  Rama,  his  limbs  and  muscles  contracted  and  he  was  sunk 
in  shame.  He  said  :  "  It  appears  that  the  Maharaja  Dasaratha 
himself  has  come  hither  to  see  us." 

Seeing  Lakshmana  abashed,  Shri  Rama  answered :  "  I  also 
believe  my  father  is  come  to  see  us,  and  will  seek  to  take  us  home 
to  the  capital,  knowing  how  grievously  we  suffer  in  the  forest ! " 

"  It  may  be,  too,  that  the  king,  knowing  Sita  to  be  worthy 
of  every  happiness,  will  take  her  home.  See,  O  Brother,  two 
excellent  horses  of  noble  breed,  swift  as  the  wind,  appear  in 
view !  The  great  and  aged  elephant  Shatrunjaya  that  carries 
my  illustrious  father,  marches  before  the  army,  but  I  feel 
apprehensive  for  I  do  not  behold  the  white  umbrella  of  my 
renowned  Lord !    O  Lakshmana,  descend  from  the  tree." 

The  prince  having  descended  in  obedience  to  Shri  Rama, 
stood  before  him  with  joined  palms. 

Shri  Bharata  meanwhile  commanded  his  army  not  to  approach 
or  disturb  the  hermitage  of  Rama.  The  army  with  its  elephants 
and  horses  occupied  an  area  of  seven  miles  and  the  prudent 
Bharata  who,  to  please  Rama,  had  rid  himself  of  all  egoity  and 
employed  only  virtuous  means,  caused  it  to  take  up  its  position 
at  some  distance  from  the  Chittrakuta  mountain. 


chapter   98 

Prince  Bharata  goes  on  foot  to  meet  Shri  Rama 

That  exalted  one,  Shri  Bharata,  truly  obedient  to  the  behests 
of  his  Guru,  perceiving  his  army  well  lodged,  proceeded  on  foot 
to  meet  Shri  Rama.  As  soon  as  the  army  was  encamped,  he 
addressed  Shatrughna  in  these  words :  "  O  Excellent  One, 
thou  with  thy  men  and  a  few  huntsmen,  speedily  search  the  forest 
and  seek  out  Shri  Rama's  hermitage.  Let  Guha  attended  by 
8  thousand  of  his  warriors,  armed  with  bows,  arrows  and  swords, 
365 


THE  RAMAYANA  OF  VALMIKI 
search  for  Shri  Rama  in  the  forest.  I,  myself,  in  the  company 
of  the  counsellors,  citizens,  elders  and  brahmins,  will  go  on 
foot  through  the  forest  I  shall  not  rest  till  I  have  beheld  the 
saintly  Rama,  the  valiant  Lakshmana  and  the  most  auspicious 
Sits.  I  shall  not  seek  repose  till  I  have  looked  on  the  shining 
countenance  of  Shri  Rama,  my  elder  brother.  My  mind  will 
taste  no  peace  till  I  have  placed  my  forehead  at  the  feet  of  Rama, 
that  bear  the  marks  of  royalty.  My  soul  will  find  no  delight 
till  I  have  placed  Shri  Rama  on  the  ancestral  throne  and  beheld 
him  anointed  with  the  holy  water  at  the  time  of  his  coronation  ! 
Fortunate  is  Prince  Lakshmana,  who  looks  on  the  moon-like, 
lotus-eyed  resplendent  face  of  Rama,  each  day.  Blessed  is  the 
daughter  of  King  Janaka,  who  follows  Shri  Rama,  the  Lord 
of  earth  and  ocean !  Blessed  also  is  Chittrakuta,  equal  to 
the  Himalayas,  on  which  Shri  Rama  dwells,  as  Kuvera  and 
Chittraratha  dwell  in  the  forest.  Blessed  is  this  forest  to-day, 
abounding  in  poisonous  serpents  and  difficult  to  penetrate, 
because  the  mighty  warrior  Rama  abides  in  it." 

Thus  speaking,  the  valiant  Prince  Bharata  entered  the  forest 
on  foot.  The  chief  of  eloquent  persons,  the  pious  Bharata, 
reached  the  centre  of  the  forest,  where  blossoming  and  fruitful 
trees  adorned  the  mountain  heights.  Climbing  a  shala  tree, 
he  saw  the  smoke  rising  from  the  fire  in  Rama's  hermitage. 
The  prince  with  his  friends  rejoiced  like  those  who  have  crossed 
the  ocean,  to  find  the  dwelling  place  of  Rama.  Finding  that 
Shri  Ramachandra  dwelt  on  the  mountain  frequented  by  ascetics, 
Shri  Bharata,  leaving  his  army  behind,  in  the  company  of  Guha 
speedily  started  for  the  hermitage. 


chapter  99 

The  four  brothers  meet  with  tears  of  joy 

Shri  Bharata  with  great  eagerness  pointed  out  the  indications 

of  the  position  of  Shri  Rama's  hermitage  to  his  brother 

Shatrughna.  He  appealed  to  Shri  Vasishtha  to  bring  his  mothers 

366 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

there  speedily,  while  he,  devoted  to  his  elder  brother,  hastily 
went  on  before.  Sumantra  followed  Shatrughna,  who  walked 
behind  Bharata  and  who  was  equally  anxious  to  behold  Rama. 
The  prince,  proceeding,  at  length  descried  the  hut  thatched 
with  leaves  in  the  midst  of  the  hermitages  of  the  ascetics,  and 
beheld  before  it  a  heap  of  broken  wood  and  flowers  plucked 
for  worship.  To  mark  the  site  of  the  ashrama,  Shri  Rama  and 
Lakshmana  had  bound  kusha  grass  and  strips  of  cloth  to  the 
trees.  He  perceived  also  great  heaps  of  the  dung  of  deer  and 
buffaloe,  dried  for  fuel,  to  be  used  in  winter. 

The  illustrious  and  mighty  Bharata  going  forward,  spoke 
measured  words  to  his  brother  and  counsellors,  saying :  "  I 
deem  we  have  reached  the  place  spoken  of  by  the  Sage 
Bharadwaja,  and  that  the  river  Mandakini  is  not  far  distant 
from  here !  Prince  Lakshmana  has  bound  strips  of  cloth  to 
the  trees,  so  that  when  fetching  water  on  a  dark  night,  he  may 
know  the  way  back  to  the  hermitage.  This  appears  to  be  the 
road  traversed  by  the  great  elephants  who  were  roaring  in  the 
forest.  I  perceive  the  black  smoke  rising  from  the  ascetics' 
sacrificial  fire.  Here,  I  shall  behold  that  Lion  among  men, 
Shri  Rama,  the  great  preceptor,  seated  in  majesty,  like  a 
resplendent  sage." 

Proceeding  a  little  further,  Prince  Bharata  reached  the  river 
Mandakini  on  Chittrakuta,  and  addressing  his  companions,  said : 
"  That  chief  of  men,  a  very  god  among  living  beings,  is  seated 
in  this  lonely  forest  in  the  posture  of  an  ascetic  Woe  unto  me, 
wretched  is  my  life  and  birth,  on  account  of  which  the  most 
resplendent  Lord  of  all,  Shri  Ramachandra  is  plunged  in  this 
affliction  and  dwells  in  the  forest  deprived  of  all  joy !  Despised 
by  men  because  of  this,  I  will  now  fall  at  the  feet  of  Rama 
and  Sita  in  order  to  propitiate  them." 

While  still  lamenting,  Bharata  perceived  the  hut  thatched 
with  leaves,  pure  and  pleasant,  covered  with  the  leafy  boughs 
of  sala,  tala  and  other  trees,  resembling  an  altar  covered  with 
kusha  grass. 

Here  and  there  mighty  bows  and  shields  covered  with  gold, 
wielded  in  battle,  hung,  adding  to  the  beauty  of  the  place,  and 
nearby  stood  a  quiver  of  arrows,  bright  as  the  rays  of  the  sun, 
and  keen  as  the  serpents  with  shining  hoods  of  the  Bhagawati 

367  2B 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

river.  There  also  were  two  scimitars  in  scabbards  of  gold  and 
two  shields  emblazoned  with  golden  flowers,  also  many  deerskins 
and  gloves  with  gold  embroidered  gauntlets.  That  habitation 
was  impregnable  as  a  cave  and  unassailable  by  the  herds  of 
wild  deer. 

Bharata  discerned  in  this  dwelling,  Shri  Rama  seated  near 
the  altar,  resplendent  as  tire.  For  a  long  time,  Shri  Bharata 
gazed  on  the  beauty  of  the  scene.  He  saw  Rama  sitting,  his 
matted  locks  coiled  on  the  crown  of  his  head,  shining  like  a  flame, 
bis  body  clad  in  a  robe  of  bark,  covered  with  the  skin  of  a 
black  antelope,  bis  shoulders  resembling  a  lion's,  his  arms 
were  long,  his  eyes  like  lotuses,  that  ruler  of  earth  and  ocean, 
the  sovereign  of  eternal  decrees !  Shri  Bharata  beheld  that 
righteous  one  with  Lakshmana  and  Sita,  seated  on  a  platform 
strewn  with  kusha  grass,  appearing  like  the  eternal  Brahma. 

Beholding  him  seated  thus,  the  pious  Bharata  was  overpowered 
with  sorrow  and  affection,  and  ran  towards  him,  his  throat 
choked  with  grief,  weeping  and  lamenting.  Though  the  pain  was 
past  restraining,  he  yet  mastered  it  and  spoke :  "Alas !  my 
elder  brother,  worthy  of  a  seat  in  the  royal  assembly,  beloved 
of  his  counsellors,  is  to-day  associating  with  wild  beasts  in  the 
forest.  He,  deserving  of  apparel  adorned  with  thousands  of 
golden  coins,  is  sitting,  clad  in  a  deerskin,  in  order  to  practise 
the  obligations  of  righteous  living.  Shri  Rama,  who  was 
formerly  adorned  with  garlands  of  different  flowers,  how  can 
he  endure  the  weight  of  bis  matted  locks  ?  He,  who  should 
have  acquired  merit  by  the  performance  of  sacrifices  aided  by 
the  rishis,  to-day  increases  bis  meritorious  deeds  by  the  practice 
of  austerity.  Now  is  the  countenance  of  my  elder  brother, 
formerly  adorned  with  sandal  paste,  covered  with  dust  1  Alas  ! 
it  is  on  my  account  that  Shri  Rama,  who  formerly  enjoyed 
every  delight,  is  to-day  undergoing  this  distress.  Woe  unto 
me,  who  am  abhored  by  all." 

Thus  lamenting,  the  wretched  Bharata,  his  face  bedewed  with 
tears,  sought  to  run  and  fall  at  the  feet  of  Rama,  but  sank 
unconscious  on  the  way.  Deeply  afflicted,  that  great  hero, 
Prince  Bharata,  cried  out :  "  O  Excellent  One,"  and  uttered 
no  more.  Exclaiming  only,  "  O  Noble  Sire  ",  he  could  proceed 
no  further.  Shatrughna,  also  weeping,  embraced  the  feet  of 
368 


AYODHYA    KANDA 
Shri  Rama,  on  which  Rama  gathering  them  both  in  his  arms, 
melted  into  tears. 

Then  Sumantra  and  Guha  approached  Shri  Rama  and 
Lakshmana,  and  it  appeared  as  if  the  Sun  and  Moon,  Jupiter 
and  Venus  had  conjoined  in  the  heavens.  The  inhabitants  of 
the  forest,  beholding  the  four  princes  met  together  in  their  midst, 
shed  tears  of  joy. 


CHAPTER     IOO 

Shri  Rama  enquires  of  Prince  Bharata  concerning  the  discharge 
of  his  royal  duties 

Shki  Ramachandra  saw  Bharata  lying  on  the  ground,  clothed 
in  ascetic's  garb,  his  hair  coiled  on  the  crown  of  his  head,  his 
palms  joined  in  supplication,  resembling  the  sun  bereft  of 
splendour,  fallen  to  earth,  at  the  time  of  the  dissolution  of  the 
world. 

Taking  hold  of  the  hands  of  his  brother,  who  was  emaciated 
and  weak,  Shri  Rama  raised  him  up  and  smelling  bis  head, 
embraced  him,  clasping  him  in  his  arms  and  tenderly  enquiring 
of  him :  "  O  Child,  where  is  thy  father,  that  thou  art  come 
to  the  forest  alone?  Had  he  lived,  thou  couldst  not  have 
come  hither  unaccompanied !  Alas  !  I  grieve  that  I  scarcely 
recognize  my  brother,  thin,  weary  and  full  of  care.  What 
brings  thee  to  the  forest  ?  O  My  Brother,  is  the  king  well 
and  happy  ?  Or  has  grief  brought  about  his  end  ?  O  Darling, 
thou  art  yet  a  child,  tell  me,  is  ought  amiss  in  that  eternal 
kingdom  ?  O  Hero  of  Truth,  hast  thou  served  the  king  well  ? 
Say,  is  that  Sovereign  of  men,  devoted  to  truth  and  to  duty, 
the  performer  of  the  great  sacrifice,  in  good  health?  Is 
that  highly  learned  monarch,  master  of  the  ascetic  brahmins, 
fully  cherished?  O  Child,  are  Mother  Kaushalya  and 
Queen  Sumitra,  mother  of  an  illustrious  son,  well  ?  Is  that 
highly  exalted  Queen  Kaushalya,  happy?  O  Friend,  dost 
thou  sufficiently  regard  that  humble,  experienced,  highborn, 
369 


THE  RAMAYANA  OF  VALMIKI 
magnanimous  companion  of  mine,  he  who  is  skilled  in  action, 
the  son  of  Shri  Vasishtha  ?  Does  the  royal  priest,  highly  versed 
in  the  Veda,  who  is  wise  and  beneficent,  inform  thee  of  the 
time  of  sacrifice  ?  O  Brother,  dost  thou  offer  full  reverence 
to  the  Gods,  father,  mother,  Guru,  thine  elders,  the  physicians 
and  brahmins?  O  Friend,  dost  thou  give  due  respect  and 
honour  to  Sudhama,  skilled  in  the  science  of  arms  and 
conversant  with  the  mantra-driven  weapons  ?  Hast  thou  made 
those  thy  counsellors,  who  are  trustworthy,  patient,  masters  of 
ethics  and  who  have  transcended  avarice  ?  O  Prince,  the  good 
fortune  of  kings  is  secret  consultation  with  those  versed  in  the 
spiritual  laws.  My  Son,  hast  thou  overcome  sleep  ?  Dost  thou 
awaken  betimes  ?  Dost  thou  in  the  late  hours  meditate  on  the 
methods  of  acquiring  legitimate  wealth  ?  Dost  thou  reflect 
alone  on  matters  of  moment  and  consult  with  thy  ministers  in 
public  ?  Do  other  monarchs  know  of  thy  decisions  before  they 
are  applied  ?  When  thou  hast  determined  upon  what  must 
and  should  be  done,  dost  thou  speedily  accomplish  it  ?  Are 
lesser  kings  acquainted  with  thy  determined  resolve  after  the 
event  or  before  thou  hast  set  it  in  motion  ?  Dost  thou  prefer 
the  society  and  advice  of  a  learned  pundit  to  that  of  countless 
fools  ?  In  times  of  adversity,  it  is  of  infinite  advantage  to  have 
the  proximity  of  a  learned  man.  If  a  sovereign  surround 
himself  with  ten  thousand  ignorant  persons,  he  will  receive 
no  help  from  them,  but  should  a  king  be  attended  by  a  wise 
minister,  thoughtful,  studious,  versed  in  the  moral  laws 
and  government,  he  will  reap  a  great  advantage.  O  Brother, 
dost  thou  employ  men  of  exalted  character  in  affairs  of  moment 
and  lesser  ones  in  unimportant  events  ?  Dost  thou  appoint 
ministers  who  are  pure  of  heart,  full  of  integrity  and  of  a  noble 
disposition,  whose  ancestors  have  served  the  crown  in  positions 
of  authority  ?  O  Son  of  Queen  Kaikeyi,  do  the  arrogant  and 
proud,  when  incensed,  offer  thee  or  thy  ministers  insult  ?  As  a 
woman  disregards  one  who  has  illicit  connection  with  another's 
wife  or  the  priests  condemn  that  man  who  has  sinned  while 
offering  the  sacrifice,  so  is  a  king  despised  who  levies  harsh  taxes. 
That  monarch  who  does  not  condemn  a  man  to  death,  who  has 
through  avarice  and  deluded  by  ambition,  accused  others  who 
are  virtuous,  and  even  threatened  the  life  of  the  king,  is  himself

Has  a  commander-in-chief  who  is  active,  victorious  over  his 
enemies,  skilled  in  arms,  patient  in  adversity,  devoted  to  thee 
and  experienced,  been  appointed  by  thee  ?  Hast  thou  honoured 
with  suitable  rewards,  those  men  who  are  valiant,  distinguished, 
eminent  in  military  sciences,  resourceful  and  whose  abilities 
have  been  tested?  Dost  thou  distribute  remuneration  and 
provisions  in  a  fitting  manner  when  they  are  due  ?  Servants 
who  are  not  paid  at  the  proper  season,  become  incensed  and 
disregard  their  master.  Dissatisfied  retainers  are  a  source  of 
danger. 

"Are  the  liege  warriors  and  chieftains  devoted  to  thee  ?  In 
time  of  need,  are  they  ready  to  lay  down  their  lives  for  thy  sake  ? 
Hast  thou  appointed,  as  thine  ambassadors,  those  who  are  citizens 
of  thy  kingdom,  who  can  divine  the  motives  of  others,  who  are 
of  sound  judgment,  eloquent,  and  able  to  overcome  their 
opponents  in  debate?  Dost  thou  employ  three  spies,  each 
unacquainted  with  the  other  to  master  the  secrets  of  the  fifteen,1 
excluding  thy  ministers,  priests  and  the  heir-apparent  ?  Dost 
thou  set  a  watch  over  enemies  whom  thou  hast  driven  from 
thy  kingdom  and  yet  who  have  returned  ?  Dost  thou  deem 
them  harmless  ?  Art  thou  attended  by  brahmins  of  atheistic 
opinions?  Such  persons  deem  themselves  wise  but,  in  fact, 
are  fools,  yet  they  may  divert  others  from  the  path  of  virtue, 
being  skilled  in  dispatching  souls  to  the  lower  regions.  They 
do  not  study  the  authorised  treatises  on  the  duties  of  men, 
but  indulge  in  arguments  against  the  Veda  and  becoming 
eminent  in  useless  knowledge,  discuss  unworthy  matters  con- 
tinually. 

"  O  Friend,  dost  thou  carefully  preserve  the  capital  Ayodhya, 
the  seat  of  our  ancestors  and  great  men,  justly  termed  'Invincible'

which  has  been  the  site  of  many  great  sacrifices,  which  contains 
innumerable  temples  and  lakes,  frequented  by  cheerful  men

adversaries,  one  who  does  not  act  at  the  proper  season,  one 
who  is  not  devoted  to  truth,  one  who  lives  under  foreign 
domination  and  one  who  is  aggressive  ?  Hast  thou  given  the 
following  due  consideration  and  found  them  to  be  in  accord

CHAPTER     IOI 

Shri  Rama  hears  the  account  of  his  father's  death 

Bhakata,  hearing  these  words  of  Rama,  replied  :  "  What  will 
the  discharge  of  royal  duties  avail  me,  who  am  destitute  of  all 
virtue  ?  O  Great  One,  according  to  the  tradition  of  our  line, 
the  younger  brother  may  not  be  king  while  the  elder  lives, 
therefore,  O  Raghava,  return  with  me  to  the  auspicious  city 
of  Ayodhya  and  for  the  sake  of  our  family,  cause  thyself  to  be 
installed  as  king.  Some  may  consider  the  king  a  man,  but  I 
hold  him  to  be  a  god,  since  his  conduct  differs  from  others, 
being  inspired  by  duty  and  divine  grace.  When  I  was  at  the 
home  of  my  maternal  uncle  and  thou  exiled  to  the  forest,  King 
Dasaratha,  adored  by  the  good,  the  performer  of  spiritual 
sacrifices,  departed  to  heaven.  As  soon  as  thou,  with  Sita  and 
Lakshmana,  hadst  left  the  capital,  the  king  overwhelmed  by 
sorrow  and  affliction,  passed  away.  O  Chief  of  Men,  offer 
the  traditional  libations  for  thy  father ;  Snatrughna  and  I  have 
already  carried  out  this  ritual  O  Prince,  it  is  said  that  the 
water  and  rice  offered  by  a  beloved  son,  grants  imperishable 
bliss  to  one  departed.  O  Raghava,  thou  wast  indeed  the  beloved 
of  thy  royal  father ;  through  grief  on  thy  account  and  the  desire 
to  see  thee,  thy  sire,  his  mind  unceasingly  fixed  on  thee, 
overcome  by  sorrow,  departed  to  heaven." 


375 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    102 

They  are  all  afflicted  with  grief 

On  hearing  the  account  of  his  father's  death,  from  his  brother, 
Shri  Rama  fell  unconscious. 

Bharata's  words  proved  as  dreadful  to  Shri  Rama,  as  the 
mace  of  Indra  falling  on  the  danavas  in  battle.  Wringing  his 
hands,  Raghava  fell  to  the  earth  like  a  tree  severed  by  an  axe. 
The  Lord  of  the  World,  Shri  Rama,  fallen  on  the  earth,  lay 
like  an  elephant  which,  having  borne  away  the  river  bank, 
sinks  under  the  load.  His  two  brothers  together  with  Sita, 
perceiving  him  to  have  fallen  in  a  swoon,  sprinkled  him  with 
water  in  order  to  restore  him. 

Recovering  somewhat,  Shri  Rama  began  to  lament.  The 
virtuous  prince,  conscious  that  his  sire  had  passed  away,  uttered 
these  pious  words  to  Bharata :  "  What  should  I  do  in  Ayodhya 
now  my  father  has  departed  to  heaven  ?  Who  can  preserve 
the  capital  bereft  of  this  illustrious  monarch  ?  What  can  I, 
worthless  and  wretched,  do  for  that  magnanimous  one,  my 
father,  who  died  through  grief  at  my  separation  and  whose 
funeral  rites  I  was  not  able  to  perform  ?  O  Sinless  Bharata, 
thou  indeed  art  blessed,  by  whom  the  last  rites  of  thy  warrior 
parent  were  performed.  Now  when  I  return  to  the  capital 
after  completing  the  term  of  my  exile,  none  will  instruct  me 
in  what  is  good  and  what  is  evil.  Formerly,  in  affection,  my 
father  being  pleased  with  my  good  conduct,  enlightened  me. 
Who  will  now  utter  those  words  which  fell  pleasingly  on  my  ears  ?  " 

Turning  his  face  towards  Sita  whose  countenance  resembled 
the  full  moon,  Rama  thus  addressed  her :  "  O  Sita,  thy  father- 
in-law  has  left  this  life,  O  Lakshmana,  thou  art  fatherless  1 
Bharata  has  related  this  bitter  news  to  us.  O  Lakshmana, 
bring  the  pulp  of  the  Ingudt  fruit  and  change  this  apparel 
of  bark.  I  desire  to  offer  libations  of  water  to  my  royal  sire. 
Let  Sita  precede  me  and  thou  follow  her ;  on  such  occasions, 
this  procedure  must  be  observed."1    Then  Sumantra,  the  aged 

1  When  they  descend  into  the  water  the  order  of  the  procession  is  that  the 
children  go  first  according  to  age,  then  the  women,  then  the  men,  the  youngest 
first,  the  eldest  last.     The  order  is  reversed  when  they  emerge. 

37« 


AYODHYA    KANDA 
retainer  of  the  royal  line,   wise,   intelligent,   tender-hearted, 
self-subdued,  and  humble,  wholly  devoted  to  Rama,  comforted 
the  princes  and  led  them  to  the  river  Mandakini  whose  waters 
were  sacred  and  meritorious. 

Deeply  afflicted,  the  illustrious  ones  approached  the  pleasant 
river  that  passed  through  blossoming  woods,  and  descending 
into  the  pure,  swift-flowing  and  un-muddied  stream,  they  offered 
the  ritual  water  in  the  name  of  their  royal  father,  saying  :  "  O 
Great  King,  may  this  water  be  thine."  Then  Shri  Rama,  filling 
his  palms  with  water,  turning  to  the  south,  wept  and  said : 
"  O  Mighty  King,  may  this  sacred  water  offered  to-day  by  me, 
be  thine  for  ever  in  the  region  of  thine  ancestors." 

Thereafter,  Raghava  with  his  brothers  offered  balls  of  rice 
in  memory  of  the  king  on  the  shores  of  the  river  Mandakini. 
Having  made  a  cake  by  mixing  the  juice  of  berries  with  the  pulp 
of  the  Ingudi  fruit,  Shri  Rama  spread  it  on  kusha  grass  and 
deeply  afflicted,  weeping,  said :  "  O  Mighty  King,  be  pleased 
to  accept  and  partake  of  this  food,  for  that  which  is  man's 
customary  food,  the  gods  approve." 

Then  ascending  the  hillside,  Shri  Rama  returned  by  the  way 
he  had  come.  The  great  Raghava,  reaching  the  door  of  the 
thatched  hut,  took  hold  of  the  hands  of  Lakshmana  and  Bharata, 
and  wept.  The  sound  of  the  weeping  of  the  four  princes  and 
Sita  re-echoed  in  the  mountains  like  the  roaring  of  a  lion,  and 
the  army  hearing  it  were  greatly  perturbed  and  said  among 
themselves,  "  Shri  Rama  and  Bharata  have  met  and  they  are 
bewailing  the  death  of  the  king,  their  sire." 

Leaving  their  camp  and  turning  their  faces  to  where  the  sound 
of  weeping  arose,  they  went  in  haste  to  that  spot.  Some  mounted 
horses  and  elephants,  some  rode  in  gilded  chariots,  and  others 
on  foot  hastened  towards  that  place,  for  though  Shri  Rama 
had  but  lately  left  the  capital,  it  appeared  to  them  as  if  he 
had  been  long  absent  from  them.  Desirous  of  seeing  Rama, 
they  proceeded  to  the  hermitage  of  the  illustrious  prince  in 
various  kinds  of  vehicles  and  the  sound  of  their  advance  and 
the  rolling  wheels  created  a  noise  like  thunder.  Elephants 
terrified  by  the  tumult  ran  with  their  mates  into  other  woods, 
perfuming  the  forest  with  their  ichor.  Boars,  wolves,  buffaloes, 
snakes,  tigers,  wild  cattle  and  deer  of  many  kinds  were  filled 
377 


THE    RAMAYAKA    OF    VALMIKI 

with  fear.  Ducks,  waterfowl,  swans,  geese,  cuckoos  and  herons 
fled  in  every  direction.  The  air  was  filled  with  birds,  and  the 
earth  with  men,  rendering  both  beautiful. 

At  length,  the  army  reached  the  place  where  they  perceived 
the  illustrious  and  innocent  Rama,  tile  chief  of  men,  seated  on 
the  sacrificial  seat,  and  seeing  his  condition  they  began  to  curse 
Kaikeyi  and  Manthara  and,  approaching  closer,  wept  bitterly. 
Shri  Rama,  observing  them  so  afflicted,  embraced  them  like 
a  parent.  Embracing  those  who  were  worthy  of  his  affection, 
offering  salutations  to  some,  he  treated  those  of  his  age  and  his 
relatives  with  the  respect  due  to  each. 

The  voice  of  their  weeping  filled  the  earth  and  sky,  and 
reverberated  in  the  caves  and  in  every  quarter  like  the  beat 
of  a  drum. 


CHAPTER    103 

Shri  Rama  greets  the  queens 

Shri  Vasishtha,  preceded  by  the  widowed  queens  of  King 
Dasaratha,  proceeding  towards  Shri  Rama's  hermitage,  beheld 
the  slow-moving  Mandakini  and  the  holy  place  frequented  by 
Rama.  Afflicted  with  grief,  Queen  Kaushalya  wept  and  then 
said  to  Sumitra  and  the  other  Queens  :  "  O  see !  here  is  the 
place  where  the  defenceless  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sita,  deprived 
by  Kaikeyi  of  their  kingdom,  come  to  bathe.  O  Sumitra, 
here  meseems  thy  son  Lakshmana  unwearyingly  brings  water 
for  my  son.  Though  engaged  in  this  menial  service,  a  kind  office 
performed  for  an  elder  brother  is  an  honourable  act !  Though 
the  carrying  of  water  is  a  humble  occupation,  when  Shri  Rama- 
chandra,  persuaded  by  Bharata,  returns  to  the  capital)  then  thy 
son,  worthy  of  every  comfort,  will  abandon  these  laborious 
duties." 

Queen  Kaushalya  of  large  eyes,  now  perceived  the  funeral  cake 

offered  by  Shri  Rama  in  memory  of  his  father.    She  beheld 

how  the  sorrow-stricken  Rama  had  laid  the  flour  ball  on  the 

ground  in  Ins  great  sire's  remembrance,  and  she  then  addressed 

378 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

the  widows  of  the  departed  king,  saying  :  "  See  how  this 
has  been  offered  by  Raghava  in  memory  of  the  great  king  of 
the  House  of  Ikshwaku.  I  do  not  consider  this  flour  ball 
mixed  with  the  juice  of  the  Ingudi  fruit  to  be  worthy  of  the 
Mahatma  Dasaratha,  who  was  equal  to  a  god !  How  should 
the  sovereign  of  the  earth  enclosed  between  the  four  seas,  find 
this  cake  of  Ingudi  pulp  acceptable  ?  Nothing  is  more  painful 
to  me  than  this,  that  the  illustrious  Rama  should  offer  this 
paltry  flour  ball  to  his  deceased  father !  Why  does  my  heart 
not  break  into  a  thousand  fragments,  seeing  this  poor  offering  ? 
It  is  a  common  saying  among  men  that  the  food  eaten  by  a  man 
is  the  food  of  his  god  and  his  ancestors. " 

The  consorts  of  the  king  consoled  the  chief  queen  and 
proceeding  onwards,  reached  the  hermitage  where  they  beheld 
Shri  Rama  seated  like  a  god  descended  from  heaven.  Seeing 
Shri  Rama  withdrawn  from  every  pleasure,  they  were  deeply 
distressed  and  wept  bitterly. 

Shri  Rama,  the  Devotee  of  Truth,  rose  up  and  touched  the 
feet  of  his  mothers,  and  the  large-eyed  queens  with  their  tender 
hands  took  tht  dust  from  his  feet.  Shri  Lakshmana,  distressed 
to  see  their  grief,  offered  salutations  to  them  with  deep  affection 
and  they,  wiping  the  dust  from  the  feet  of  Shri  Rama, 
manifested  the  same  love  to  Prince  Lakshmana,  since  he,  too, 
was  the  son  of  King  Dasaratha.  Sita  also,  full  of  grief,  her  eyes 
suffused  with  tears,  stood  before  the  queens  touching  their  feet. 

Kaushalya,  embracing  Shri  Sita  who  was  emaciated  through 
the  privations  of  her  exile,  addressed  her  as  a  mother  her 
daughter  and  said :  "Alas !  Alas !  the  daughter  of  King 
Videha,  the  daughter-in-law  of  King  Dasaratha,  and  the  consort 
of  Shri  Ramachandra,  has  undergone  great  privations  in  the 
forest.  O  Janaki,  I  bum  with  the  fire  of  grief  when  I  behold 
thy  countenance  scorched  by  the  sun  like  the  faded  crimson 
water  lilies,  or  gold  denied  with  dust,  or  the  moon  obscured 
by  clouds.  I  am  being  consumed  by  the  pain  arising  from  this, 
like  a  piece  of  wood1  slowly  consumed  by  fire." 

While  Queen  Kaushalya  was  thus  lamenting,  Shri  Rama- 
chandra approached  the  Holy  Vasishtha  and  touched  his  lotus 

1  Videha  is  the  name  given  to  the  two  pieces  of  wood  from  which  a  fire  is 
kindled.     There  is,  therefore,  a  play  on  the  name  of  Sita,  here.

feet.  Having  touched  the  feet  of  the  great  ascetic,  who  was 
as  resplendent  as  fire,  like  Indra  offering  salutations  to  the  feet 
of  Brihaspati,  Shri  Rama  sat  down  near  him. 

Then  the  pious  Bharata  accompanied  by  his  counsellors,  the 
chief  people  of  the  city,  and  his  generals,  approached  Shri  Rama 
and  occupied  a  lower  seat. 

The  heroic  Bharata,  with  joined  palms,  seated  by  his  elder 
brother  who  was  attired  in  ascetic's  garb,  appeared  like  Frajapati 
seated  before  Brahma  !  At  that  moment,  the  principal  citizens 
present  were  rilled  with  curiosity  to  know  what  Shri  Bharata 
would  say  to  Raghava.  The  ever-truthful  and  valiant  Rama, 
seated  with  Bharata  and  Lakshmana,  together  resembled  three 
ritual  fires  in  the  place  of  sacrifice. 


CHAPTER     IO4 

He  requests  Prince  Bharata  to  ascend  the  throne 

Shri  Rama,  together  with  Lakshmana,  addressed  Shri  Bharata, 
saying  :  "  O  Bharata,  say  why  thou  art  come  hither  to  the  forest 
in  ascetic's  garb,  clothed  in  bark  and  deerskin?  For  what 
purpose,  O  Prince,  hast  thou,  abandoning  thy  throne,  come  to 
the  forest,  attired  in  the  skin  of  the  antelope  ?  " 

Thus  questioned,  Shri  Bharata  controlling  his  grief,  answered  : 
"  O  Noble  Sire,  my  father,  the  king,  by  my  mother  acting  in 
an  improper  manner,  has  died  of  grief  through  separation  from 
his  son.  O  Mighty  Prince,  my  mother  has  done  an  exceedingly 
evil  deed  and  forfeited  her  fair  name.  Widowed  and  over- 
whelmed with  affliction,  she  will  fall  into  hell.  Though  the  son 
of  Kaikeyi,  yet  am  I  thy  servant.  Be  gracious  to  me  and  allow 
thyself  to  be  installed  to-day  and  ascend  the  throne  like  Indra. 
The  elders  of  the  people  and  my  widowed  mother  have  come 
hither  to  entreat  thee.  Be  pleased  to  grant  our  request,  0 
Lord. 

"  Q  Thou  who  payest  due  deference  to  all  men,  being  the 
eldest  son  of  the  king,  shouldst  by  right  occupy  the  throne. 
380 


AYODHYA     KANDA 

Accept  the  burden  of  kingship  and  gratify  the  desire  of  thy 
friends.  The  earth,  obtaining  thee  as  her  Lord,  will  rest  satisfied 
as  the  winter  night  in  the  presence  of  the  moon.  Not  only 
am  I  thy  brother,  but  thy  devoted  follower  and  servant.  I 
and  my  ministers  salute  thee  and  beg  of  thee  to  look  with  favour 
on  our  request 

"  O  Chief  of  Men,  let  not  these  counsellors  and  those  who 
have  traditionally  held  office,  plead  in  vain." 

Having  spoken,  Prince  Bharata,  his  eyes  suffused  with  tears, 
placed  his  head  at  the  feet  of  Shri  Rama.  Shri  Rama  lifting 
him  up  embraced  Prince  Bharata  who  was  sighing  like  one 
distraught,  and  said  :  "  O  Bharata,  why  should  a  virtuous  and 
enlightened  prince  such  as  thou,  act  so  that  his  elder  brother 
commit  sin  ?  O  Hero,  I  see  no  fault  in  thee,  but  it  behoves 
thee  not  to  speak  ill  of  thy  mother.  O  Sinless  One,  the  father 
or  the  spiritual  preceptor  can  order  his  disciple,  his  servant 
or  his  wife  as  he  will.  Therefore,  it  must  be  known  to  thee, 
that  a  wise  son  or  devotee  should  ever  manifest  obedience. 
I  am,  therefore,  submissive  to  my  sire. 

"  O  Lovely  One,  we  are  subject  to  the  king  and  it  is  one 
if  he  send  us  to  the  forest,  to  the  abode  of  ascetics,  or  retain  us 
in  his  proximity.  O  Chief  of  the  Virtuous,  a  mother  should 
be  revered  even  as  the  father.  O  Bharata,  by  the  command 
of  my  pious  mother  and  father,  I  was  sent  to  the  forest,  how 
should  I  dare  to  disobey  them  ? 

"Do  thou,  O  Prince,  return  to  the  capital  and  acclaimed 
by  the  people,  ascend  the  throne,  while  I  reside  in  the  forest 
as  an  ascetic.  Remember,  thus  did  the  king  resolve  in  the 
presence  of  his  people  and  now  he  has  departed.  The  sovereign 
is  the  instructor  of  his  people  and  of  thee  also,  and  it  was  meet 
he  should  do  as  he  has  done.  O  Bharata,  do  thou  enjoy  the 
kingdom  given  thee  by  my  father. 

"  O  Beautiful  One,  I  shall  remain  in  the  Dandaka  forest  for 
fourteen  years  and  enjoy  what  my  father  has  conferred  on  me. 
The  illustrious  monarch,  my  sire,  honoured  by  the  whole  world, 
has  commanded  me  to  come  to  the  forest  and  to  obey  him 
is  my  happiness. 

"  Meseems  the  sovereignty  of  the  whole  world  is  vain  if  it 
be  mine  in  defiance  of  my  father's  command."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     105 

Prince  Bharata  appeals  to  Shri  Rama  to  return  and  rule 

the  kingdom 

The  princes  surrounded  by  relatives  and  friends  passed  the  night 
sorrowing.  The  day  having  dawned,  the  brothers  observed 
the  fire  sacrifice  and  performed  the  repetition  of  silent  prayer 
on  the  banks  of  the  river  Mandakini,  then  entering  the  hermitage 
of  Rama,  they  sat  in  profound  silence,  no  one  uttering  a  word, 
a  great  peace  prevailing  over  all. 

At  length,  Shri  Bharata,  in  the  midst  of  his  friends,  broke 
the  silence  and  thus  addressed  Shri  Rama  :  "  O  My  Brother, 
our  illustrious  sovereign  conferred  the  kingdom  on  me  to  satisfy 
my  mother  and  fulfil  the  obligation  of  his  former  boons  and 
my  mother  having  given  this  kingdom  to  me,  I  now  offer  it 
to  thee,  enjoy  it  without  hindrance.  When  the  dam  bursts  in 
the  rainy  season,  none  can  stem  the  tide,  similarly  none  but  thee 
can  protect  this  vast  dominion.  O  King,  as  an  ass  cannot  equal 
the  pace  of  a  horse,  nor  an  ordinary  bird's  flight  that  of  an  eagle, 
so  am  I  unable  to  rule  the  kingdom  without  thee. 

"  O  Rama,  happy  is  the  sovereign  on  whom  others  depend, 
but  wretched  is  the  one  who  depends  on  others.  A  tree 
planted  and  watered,  though  it  grow  and  spread  forth  great 
branches  that  no  dwarf  can  scale,  and  be  covered  with  blossom, 
if  it  bear  no  fruit,  the  one  who  planted  it  suffers  obloquy.  O 
Mighty  Hero,  let  this  metaphor  be  understood  by  thee,  that 
thou,  being  the  Lord  of  all,  mayst  guide  thy  servants.  O 
Lord,  let  us  behold  thee,  the  destroyer  of  thy  foes,  seated  on 
the  royal  throne,  shining  resplendent  like  the  sun.  May  these 
mighty  tuskers  follow  thy  chariot  and  all  the  queens  dwelling 
in  the  palace  rejoice." 

The  people  hearing  Shri  Bharata's  words  applauded  them 
saying,  "  Well  said ! "    "  Well  said ! " 

Then  the  compassionate  Rama  perceiving  Bharata  afflicted 
and  lamenting,  consoled  him  saying  :  "  0  Bharata,  man  is  not 
free,  time1  drags  him  hither  and  thither.  All  objects  perish,  all 
individualised  souls  must  depart  when  their  merit  is  exhausted ; 

1  Time  is  the  form  of  destiny. 

382 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

sons,  friends,  wives,  all  who  live  must  die  one  day.  Hoarding 
and  spending,  prosperity  and  destitution,  meeting  and  partings 
life  and  death  are  all  akin.  When  the  ripe  fruit  falls,  we  are 
not  surprised,  thus  a  man  being  born  should  not  fear  when 
death  claims  him. 

"As  a  building  supported  by  stout  pillars  on  becoming  old, 
falls  into  ruins,  so  man  subject  to  age,  must  one  day  meet  with 
dissolution.  O  Bharata,  the  night  once  past,  does  not  come 
again ;  so  the  waters  of  the  Yamuna,  flowing  to  the  sea,  do 
not  return.  See !  the  days  and  nights  are  passing  away, 
decreasing  the  period  of  our  life's  span,  as  the  rays  of  the  sun 
in  summer  suck  up  the  earth's  moisture.  O  Prince,  grieve  for 
thyself  therefore,  there  is  nought  else  worthy  of  grief !  Age 
withers  all  whether  movable  or  immovable.  Death  is  ever  at 
our  side,  nor  does  it  leave  us  when  we  travel  to  a  distant  place, 
and  it  is  still  present  at  our  returning ! 

"  What  shall  a  man  do  when  his  skin  is  wrinkled  and  grey  hair 
covers  his  head  and  he  is  stricken  in  years  ?  Man  rejoices  when 
the  sun  rises  and  sets,  heedless  of  the  waning  of  his  powers. 
He  welcomes  the  approach  of  each  season,  such  as  the  arrival 
of  spring,  yet  the  succession  of  the  seasons  devours  man's  days  ! 
As  pieces  of  driftwood,  floating  on  the  sea,  come  together  for 
a  space,  so  wives,  sons,  relatives,  wealth  and  property  remain 
with  us  a  while,  but  in  the  course  of  time,  leave  us. 

"  One,  sitting  by  the  wayside,  cries  to  a  group  of  travellers 
passing  by,  *  Let  me  also  go  with  you  !  *  why  then  should  man 
grieve  to  tread  the  road,  which  has  been  trodden  by  his 
predecessors  ?  The  life  of  man,  like  a  river  flowing,  does  not 
return,  thus  our  days  diminish  and  we  should  perform  those 
righteous  acts  that  bring  us  to  the  knowledge  of  Reality. 

"  Practising  virtue,  man  should  enjoy  worldly  pleasures  ;  our 
rather,  the  illustrious  Dasaratha,  having  performed  benevolent 
deeds  and  given  fitting  charitable  gifts,  has  departed,  clothed 
in  virtue.  Having  cherished  his  servants  and  nourished  his 
people,  having  levied  those  taxes  alone  warranted  by  moral  duty, 
having  set  up  water  tanks  and  created  reservoirs  and  performed 
many  sacrificial  acts,  he  has  passed  away.  Leaving  the  world 
after  enjoying  a  variety  of  pleasures  and  offering  countless 
sacrifices,  the  king,  at  a  great  age,  has  gone  to  heaven. 

383  2C 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  O  Brother,  it  is  not  meet  to  grieve  for  the  king,  who,  full 
of  years,  having  enjoyed  the  pleasures  of  the  world,  respected 
by  the  good,  has  given  up  his  life.  Having  abandoned  his 
worn-out  frame,  he  has  obtained  the  form  of  a  celestial  being. 

"A  wise,  learned  and  enlightened  man  like  thee,  should  not 
grieve  for  such  a  sire.  Exercising  patience,  thou  shouldst  cease 
to  lament  and  giving  up  sorrow  return  to  the  capital.  O  Chief 
among  the  Eloquent,  thy  father  has  commanded  thee  to  dwell 
in  Ayodhya.  I  too  will  perform  the  behests  of  him  who  ever 
practised  righteousness ! 

"  I  cannot  disregard  the  commands  of  my  illustrious  father, 
he  is  worthy  to  be  obeyed  by  thee  and  me,  being  our  parent 
and  our  ruler.  O  Son  of  Raghu,  I  shall,  therefore,  obey  his  will 
and  dwell  in  the  forest  O  Chief  of  Men,  those  who  desire 
felicity  in  a  future  state,  and  who  are  virtuous  and  benevolent 
should  obey  their  elders.  O  Great  One,  bear  in  mind  the 
behests  of  our  father,  a  lover  of  truth,  and  return  to  the  capital 
to  rule  over  the  kingdom !  " 

The  magnanimous  Rama,  having  uttered  these  sage  words 
relative  to  the  need  for  obedience  to  his  father,  became  silent. 


CHAPTER    106 

In  spite  of  the  entreaties  exhorting  him  to  return,  Shri  Rama 
remains  steadfast  in  his  vow 

Rama,  the  lover  of  his  people,  having  spoken,  ceased ;  then 
the  pious  Bharata  answered  Rama,  putting  forth  persuasive 
arguments  of  righteous  purport,  saying :  "  O  Lord,  who  is  there 
in  this  world  like  thee  ?  Adversity  does  not  move  thee,  nor 
does  any  agreeable  thing  touch  thee.  All  look  on  thee  as  their 
superior,  yet  thou  seekest  counsel  of  thine  elders ! 

"  The  man  to  whom  the  living  and  dead  are  one  and  who 
is  indifferent  as  to  what  he  possesses  or  loses,  for  what  reason 
should  he  grieve  ?  O  Lord,  those  who  like  thee,  know,  as  thou 
dost,  what  is  the  nature  of  the  soul  and  its  essence,  are  not 
moved  in  the  hour  of  distress ! 

384 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

"  O  Prince  of  Raghu,  like  the  gods,  thou  art  magnanimous, 
thou  art  ever  forbearing  and  faithful  to  thy  vows.  Thou  art 
wise,  thou  knowest  and  seest  all !  Thou  art  aware  of  the 
motives  of  men's  actions  and  the  cause  of  their  abandoning 
them,  therefore,  that  distress  which  is  insupportable  to  others, 
does  not,  in  any  wise,  disturb  thee." 

Having  spoken  thus,  Bharata  continued :  '*  O  Rama,  be 
gracious  to  me,  though  during  my  absence  in  a  strange  land, 
my  mother  committed  those  sins  which  cause  my  affliction. 
I  am  bound  by  the  ties  of  duty,  else  would  I  have  slain  my 
wicked  mother.  What  is  evil  and  what  is  good  is  known  to  me, 
descended  as  I  am  from  the  righteous  King  Dasaratha,  therefore 
I  am  unable  to  act  contrary  to  virtue.  I  cannot  speak  evil  in 
the  assembly  of  my  pious  and  aged  rather,  who  has  passed  away, 
and  where  is  a  man  to  be  found  so  wholly  acquainted  with 
the  law  of  righteousness  as  was  the  king,  yet  what  person 
familiar  with  the  moral  law,  would  commit  so  great  a  wrong 
prompted  by  the  desire  to  please  a  woman  ?  There  is  an  ancient 
saving  that,  at  the  approach  of  death,  man  loses  the  power 
of  judgment !  The  king  has  verily  justified  this  adage  to  the 
whole  world !  Through  fear  of  Queen  Kaikeyi's  wrath  or  her 
threat  of  self-imposed  destruction,  or  through  mental  agitation, 
the  king  may  have  acted  thus  without  consulting  his  subjects, 
but  thou  art  not  bound  by  such  a  deed.  He  who  imputes 
the  transgressions  of  his  father  to  righteous  motives  is  not 
considered  a  good  son ;  as  heir  to  the  king,  reveal  not  the  errors 
of  thy  sire,  but  conceal  this  unjust  deed  from  the  world. 

"  O  Hero,  it  is  thy  duty  to  save  my  mother  Kaikeyi,  my  father, 
my  relatives  and  myself  from  the  consequences  of  this  action 
condemned  by  all.  O  Brother,  remember  thy  duty  as  a  warrior 
and  reflect  on  the  outcome  of  thy  sojourn  in  the  forest  as  an 
ascetic,  but  do  thou  also  consider  the  good  of  thy  people.  It 
becomes  thee  not  to  undertake  this  course  of  action.  The  first 
duty  of  a  warrior  is  to  be  installed  so  that  he  may  be  able  to 
protect  his  people.  Say,  why  should  a  man  giving  up  that  which 
is  an  established  duty,  embrace  that  which  is  wretched,  cheerless, 
visionary  and  undefined?  If,  O  Blessed  One,  thou  desirest 
to  undertake  this  mortification,  why  dost  thou  not  seek  it  through 
the  arduous  labour  of  ruling  the  four  castes  ?    It  is  said  that 

3«5 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  duty  of  the  householder  is  the  highest  dharma,  then,  why 
dost  thou  abandon  it  ? 

"  O  Lord,  hear  me ;  I  am  but  thy  child  in  respect  of  learning, 
age  and  state,  how  should  I  be  able  to  govern  the  kingdom  ? 
I,  a  child,  void  of  understanding  and  virtue  and  in  rank 
also  thine  inferior ;  how  should  I  be  able  to  live  without  thee 
much  less  rule  in  thy  stead  ?  Therefore,  O  Raghava,  O  Thou 
Virtuous  One,  do  thou,  with  thy  relatives  govern  the  kingdom 
without  opposition  and  acquire  merit !  The  great  sage,  the 
Holy  Vasishtha,  is  here  present  with  the  ministers  and  priests, 
permit  thyself  to  be  crowned  and  return  with  us  to  Ayodhya  ! 

"As  Indra,  having  conquered  his  foes,  entered  heaven  attended 
by  the  Maruts,  do  thou  enter  Ayodhya,  thereby  discharging 
thy  duties  to  the  gods,  the  sages,  and  thine  ancestors,  gratifying 
the  ambitions  of  thy  friends  !  Regard  me  as  thy  servant  and 
command  me !  O  Noble  One,  let  thy  friends  to-day  rejoice 
at  thine  enthronement  and  let  the  evil  doers  flee  to  the  uttermost 
ends  of  the  earth  !  O  Chief  of  Men,  wash  away  the  taint  of 
my  mother's  guilt  and  deliver  our  great  parent  from  this  heinous 
sin.  With  my  head  bent  in  submission,  I  entreat  thee ;  as  Shri 
Vishnu  shows  his  compassion  to  all  beings,  do  thou  show  mercy 
to  us.  Shouldst  thou  however  reject  my  prayer  and  go  hence  to 
some  other  forest,  then  will  I  follow  thee  there  !  " 

Shri  Rama,  thus  entreated  by  Shri  Bharata,  who  had  placed 
his  head  at  the  feet  of  his  brother  in  humility,  still  remained 
steadfast  in  his  vow  and  did  not  waver  or  consent  to  return 
to  Ayodhya.  Beholding  the  constancy  of  Shri  Rama,  all  present 
rejoiced  to  see  him  so  faithful  to  his  vow,  yet  bewailed  his 
determination  not  to  return  to  the  capital. 

The  merchants,  the  learned  brahmins  and  the  priests  filled 
with  wonder,  and  the  weeping  matrons,  praised  Bharata  and 
unitedly  entreated  Rama  to  return.

He  instructs  Prince  Bharata  to  return  and  be  installed 

Shri  Rama,  worshipped  by  Bharata,  who  sought  to  petition 
him  further,  replied  to  his  younger  brother  in  the  presence 
of  the  other  warriors,  saying :  "  O  Bharata,  Son  of  Queen 
Kaikeyi,  and  the  mighty  Dasaratha,  what  thou  hast  said  is  meet 
and  right.  In  ancient  times  when  King  Dasaratha,  our  sire, 
sought  thy  mother,  Princess  Kaikeyi,  in  marriage,  he  promised 
her  father  that  he  would  be  succeeded  by  a  son  of  hers. 
Furthermore,  in  the  war  between  the  gods  and  asuras,  our 
sovereign  made  the  promise  of  two  boons  to  thy  mother  in 
return  for  her  great  services,  in  consequence  of  which  thy 
illustrious  and  charming  mother  asked  two  favours  of  the  king, 
holding  him  to  his  word. 

"  O  Lion  among  Men !  By  one  boon  was  my  exile  secured 
and  by  the  other  the  kingdom  was  obtained  for  thee.  O  Chief 
of  men,  as  a  result  of  the  boon  granted  by  my  father,  I  have 
consented  to  live  in  the  forest  for  fourteen  years. 

"  Determined  to  prove  the  truth  of  my  lather's  word,  I  have 
entered  the  forest  with  Sita  and  Lakshmana,  regardless  of  heat 
and  cold.  O  Great  Ruler,  it  becomes  thee  also  to  prove  thy 
father  to  be  a  votary  of  truth  and  allow  thyself  to  be  speedily 
installed.  O  Bharata,  honour  this  debt,  thou  owest  it  to  the 
king,  and  thus  protect  his  fair  name.  By  occupying  the  throne, 
shalt  thou  succeed  in  pleasing  me  and  rejoicing  thy  mother, 
Queen  Kaikeyi. 

"  O  Friend,  I  have  heard  that  formerly  a  great  monarch 
named  Gaya,  when  offering  a  sacrifice  at  Gaya,  to  the  spirit 
of  his  ancestors,  said :  'A  son  is  called  "  Puttra  "  because  he 
saves  his  father  from  hell  and  protects  the  spirits  of  his  ancestors 
by  enjoined  acts  of  benevolence. * 

"  To  have  many  learned  and  virtuous  sons  is  greatly  to  be 
desired,  for  some  of  them  may  offer  a  sacrifice  at  Gaya  and  thus 
deliver  the  spirits  of  their  ancestors. 

"  O  Son  of  Raghu,  all  the  royal  sages  have  approved  this  tenet, 
thou  shouldst  also,  therefore,  accept  it  O  Bharata*  do  thou 
387 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

return  to  Ayodhya  with  Shatrughna  and  thy  people  and  promote 
the  happiness  of  thy  subjects  there. 

"  O  King,  I  shall  speedily  retire  to  the  Dandaka  forest  with 
Sita  and  Lakshmana.  O  Bbarata,  be  thou  king  of  men  and  I 
will  be  sovereign  over  the  wild  beasts.  Do  thou  return  joyfully 
to  the  capital  and  I  will  cheerfully  proceed  to  the  forest. 

"  May  the  royal  canopy  protect  thee  from  the  sun's  heat, 
I  shall  seek  shelter  from  its  rays  in  the  dense  shadows  of  the 
trees.  O  Bharata,  Shatrughna  of  limitless  understanding  shall 
attend  thee,  and  I  shall  be  attended  by  the  illustrious  Prince 
Lakshmana.  O  Brother,  do  not  be  a  prey  to  grief  any  longer, 
thus  shall  we,  the  four  sons  of  the  great  King  Dasaratha,  establish 
his  fame  in  the  realm  of  truth." 


CHAPTER    108 

A  brahmin  utters  words  contrary  to  dharma 

As  Shri  Rama  thus  instructed  Bharata,  a  brahmin  named  Javali 
uttered  these  words  contrary  to  dharma :  "  Well-spoken,  O 
Raghava,  but  it  is  not  for  thee  to  think  as  common  men,  for 
thou  art  a  man  of  understanding  and  also  a  philosopher. 
Consider  well,  O  Prince,  a  man  has  neither  a  real  friend  nor 
an  enemy,  he  enters  the  world  alone  and  leaves  it  alone  also. 
He  who  thinks  *  This  is  my  father '  or  '  This  is  my  mother ' 
and  becomes  attached  to  this  relationship  is  without  sense. 
From  the  standpoint  of  right  reasoning,  none  belongs  to  any. 
As  a  man  travelling  from  his  own  village  to  another,  remains 
for  the  night  somewhere  on  the  way  and  leaves  at  dawn,  so 
father,  mother,  wealth  and  family  remain  with  a  man  for  a 
brief  space  and  the  wise  do  not  become  attached  to  them. 

"  O  Chief  of  Men,  thou  dost  not,  being  youthful,  merit  the 
path  of  suffering  set  with  thorns  ;  it  ill  becomes  thee  to  abandon 
thy  father's  kingdom.  Return  to  Ayodhya  and  rule  over  that 
prosperous  land.  The  goddess  protecting  Ayodhya,  devoted 
to  thee,  awaits  thy  return.  O  Prince,  enjoy  those  chosen 
388 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

pleasures  which  befit  a  king  and  divert  thyself  in  the  capital 
as  Indta  in  Amaravati.  Dasaratha  is  nought  to  thee  nor  thou 
to  him,  the  king  is  one  person  and  thou  another,  therefore, 
follow  u^e  advice  I  give  thee. 

"  The  father's  seed  is  but  the  remote  cause  of  man's  birth, 
since  if  it  does  not  enter  the  mother's  womb,  it  cannot  fructify ; 
the  true  source  of  conception  is  the  womb  of  the  mother.  The 
king  has  departed  to  the  place  destined  for  all  mortals.  Why 
dost  thou  claim  this  false  relationship  and  distress  thyself  in 
vain,  O  Rama  ?  I  grieve  for  those  who,  abandoning  the 
pleasures  of  the  world,  seek  to  acquire  merit  for  felicity  hereafter 
and  sink  to  an  untimely  death,  I  do  not  grieve  for  others.  Men 
waste  food  and  other  precious  things  by  offering  them  up  yearly, 
as  sacrifices  in  honour  of  their  departed  ancestors.  O  Rama, 
has  a  dead  man  ever  partaken  of  food  ?  If  food  that  is  eaten 
by  one,  nourishes  another,  then  those  who  journey  need  never 
carry  provision  on  the  way.  Relatives  might  feed  a  brahmin, 
in  his  name,  at  home ! 

"  O  Ramachandra,  these  scriptural  injunctions  were  laid  down 
by  learned  men,  skilled  in  inducing  others  to  give,  and  finding 
other  means  of  obtaining  wealth,  thus  subjugating  the  simple- 
minded.  Their  doctrine  is  *  Sacrifice,  give  in  charity,  consecrate 
yourselves,  undergo  austerities  and  become  ascetics  '.  O  Rama, 
be  wise,  there  exists  no  world  but  this,  that  is  certain !  Enjoy 
that  which  is  present  and  cast  behind  thee  that  which  is 
unpleasant !  Adopting  the  principle  acceptable  to  all,  do  thou 
receive  the  kingdom  offered  thee  by  Bharata." 


CHAPTER     109 

Shri  Rama  replies  in  words  based  on  the  Vedas 

Shri  Rama,  patiently  giving  ear  to  the  utterance  of  Javali,  replied 
with  a  due  sense  of  judgment  and  in  words  based  on  his  belief 
that  those  duties  enjoined  in  the  Vedas,  should  be  fulfilled. 
"O  Muni,  that  which  thou  hast  spoken  with  the  desire  to 
389 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

please  me,  is  not  authorized,  nor  are  thy  admonitions  just,  since, 
even  the  most  cursory  analysis  proves  them  to  be  false.  O  Sage, 
in  the  assembly  of  the  good,  men  who  are  not  self-subdued 
and  who  are  wanting  in  integrity  and  those  who  act  contrary 
to  what  is  ordered  by  the  scriptures,  are  not  honoured.  It  is 
his  conduct  that  renders  man  virtuous,  a  coward  or  a  hero  and 
transmutes  impurity  to  purity.  Should  I  embrace  error  and 
abandon  the  authority  of  my  elders,  relinquishing  rectitude 
and  honour,  as  also  moral  conduct  and  the  Vedic  ordinance, 
then  I,  conforming  to  thy  beliefs  and  sacrificing  prudence, 
would  forfeit  the  respect  of  wise  and  virtuous  men. 

"  Following  thy  counsel,  were  I  to  cease  to  pursue  the  way 
of  truth  and  tread  the  lower  path,  by  what  means  should  X 
attain  heaven  ?  Were  I  to  depart  from  the  moral  code,  then 
every  man  might  act  according  to  his  inclination,  since  the 
subject  mirrors  the  king,  in  action. 

"Above  all,  a  sovereign  should  manifest  probity,  benevolence, 
his  chief  duty  being  to  uphold  truth;  truth  is  verily  the 
kingdom,  by  truth  is  the  world  supported. 

"  The  gods  and  sages  esteem  truth  as  the  highest  principle. 
He  who  utters  truth  attains  the  supreme  state.  Men  fear  a  liar 
as  they  do  a  venomous  serpent,  truth  is  the  root  of  all  felicity 
and  the  support  not  only  of  this  world,  but  the  best  means 
of  attaining  heaven ! 

"  Whatever  is  offered  in  sacrifice,  whatever  austerity  is 
undertaken  has  its  foundation  in  truth,  so  the  Vedas  declare, 
hence  truth  is  the  most  sacred  of  all  things. 

"  One  maintains  a  family,  another  governs  the  whole  world, 
another  falls  into  hell,  another  attains  heaven  in  accordance 
with  the  fruit  of  his  actions  I  Acquainted  with  the  law  of  Karma 
founded  on  truth,  ought  I  not  to  prove  my  sire  a  devotee  of 
that  truth  ?  Why  should  not  I,  who  have  pledged  my  word, 
follow  that  which  I  have  accepted  as  truth  ?  Honouring  my 
father's  vow,  I  shall  never  abandon  the  way  of  truth  either  for 
the  sake  of  governing  a  kingdom  or  through  being  misled  by  others 
or  through  ignorance  or  anger.  Hast  thou  not  heard  that 
neither  the  Gods  nor  the  ancestors  receive  the  offerings  of  one 
who  is  irresolute,  infirm  of  purpose  and  false  to  his  word  ? 

"  I  hold  truth  as  the  supreme  virtue  of  mankind.  I  desire 
390 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

to  reverence  that  truth  upheld  by  men  of  old.  Should  I  follow 
the  duty  of  a  warrior,  I  should  be  unjust.  To  do  that  which 
is  false  is  worthy  only  of  mean,  covetous  and  depraved  souls. 
Should  I  pursue  that  crooked  path)  indicated  by  thee,  then  I 
should  perpetrate  falsehood,  through  the  mind,  the  body  and 
the  soul.  Those  who  uphold  truth  acquire  land,  renown,  fame, 
and  heaven  also;  therefore,  let  all  men  utter  truth  and  act 
according  to  truth ! 

"  That  which  thou,  after  much  deliberation,  believest  to  be 
true,  and  recommendest  to  me  is  wholly  improper.  O  how 
can  I  disregard  the  command  of  my  sire,  that  I  should  reside 
in  the  forest  ?  When  I  pledged  my  word  in  the  presence  of 
my  father,  to  enter  the  forest,  Queen  Kaikeyi  was  rendered 
glad  at  heart,  how  should  I  now  give  her  cause  for  distress  ? 

"  Giving  up  falsehood  and  deceit,  differentiating  between  what 
should  and  should  not  be  done,  subduing  the  senses,  possessed 
of  full  faith  in  the  Vedic  injunctions,  I  shall  devote  myself  to 
the  fulfilment  of  my  father's  will ! 

"  By  sacrifice,  one  acquires  the  state  of  Indra  and  enters 
heaven.    The  sages  by  virtue  of  sacrifice  have  gone  thither." 

The  illustrious  and  glorious  Ramachandra,  highly  displeased 
by  the  materialistic  arguments  of  Javali  spoke  thus  in  terms 
of  refutation  and  reproof:  "  O  Javali,  by  speaking  the  truth, 
by  pursuing  the  duties  of  their  caste  and  station,  by  manifesting 
their  valour  in  time  of  need,  by  gentle  speech,  by  service  of 
their  spiritual  preceptor,  the  gods  and  unexpected  guests,  men 
attain  heaven '  Therefore,  those  brahmins  instructed  in  truth, 
pursue  virtue  with  a  single  mind  in  accordance  with  their  caste 
and  station  and  eagerly  await  their  entrance  to  Brahmaloka.1 
O  Javali,  I  perceive  with  regret  the  action  of  my  illustrious 
parent  in  permitting  one  of  atheistic  ideas,  who  has  fallen  from 
the  path  of  rectitude  enjoined  in  the  Vedas,  to  remain  in  his 
court.  Those  who  preach  the  heretical  doctrine  of  the  Charvaka 
school,  are  not  only  infidels,  but  have  deviated  from  the  path 
of  truth.  It  is  die  duty  of  a  monarch  to  deal  with  such  persons 
as  with  felons,  nor  should  men  of  understanding  and  learning 
stand  in  the  presence  of  such  atheists. 

"  O  Javali,  those  versed  in  wisdom,  who  preceded  thee, 

1  Brahmaloka— the  abode  of  Shri  Brahma,  the  Creator. 

391 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

performed  many  holy  acts  by  virtue  of  which  they  acquired 
eminence  here  and  in  the  spiritual  realm.  Those  sages  have 
ever  practised  harmlessness,  truth,  asceticism,  charity,  benevo- 
lence and  sacrifice. 

"  O  Javali,  those  who  fulfil  their  spiritual  duty,  who  are  the 
foremost  in  deeds  of  charity,  and  who  harm  none,  who  frequent 
the  assemblies  of  the  good  and  are  revered  by  all  men,  they 
are  without  sin,  their  name  shall  live  for  ever  as  that  of  our 
illustrious  Guru,  Shri  Vasishtha." 

Rama,  having  uttered  these  harsh  words  to  Javali,  he,  with 
humility  addressed  Rama  saying :  "  O  Rama,  I  am  no  atheist ; 
on  this  occasion,  I  assumed  this  atheistical  disguise  in  order  to 
turn  thee  from  thy  purpose  and  persuade  thee  to  return  to  the 
capital ! " 


CHAPTER    I  10 

Vasishtha  proclaiming  the  tradition  of  the  dynasty, 
calls  upon  Rama  to  return 

Perceiving  Rama  still  to  be  indignant  at  the  speech  of  Javali, 
the  holy  Vasishtha  said : — 

"  O  Rama,  the  Sage  Javali  is  a  believer  in  the  transmigration 
of  the  soul ;  he  has  thus  spoken  through  his  desire  to  persuade 
thee  to  return  to  the  capital.  O  Sovereign  of  Men,  hear  from 
me  concerning  the  creation  of  the  world. 

"  In  the  beginning,  all  was  water,  and  from  that  element 
the  earth  was  formed  and  after  this,  Brahma  and  other  gods 
came  into  existence.  The  eternal,  imperishable  Brahma  was 
begotten  of  akasha  (ether)  and  from  him  came  forth  Marichi, 
and  from  him  Kashyapa  was  produced.  From  Kashyapa  was 
born  Vivaswat,  and  the  son  of  Vivaswat  was  Manu  himself, 
who  was  the  first  among  the  Prajapatis.  Ikshwaku  was  the  son 
of  Manu  and  to  him  the  whole  world  was  given  by  Manu,  and 
Ikshwaku  became  the  first  King  of  Ayodhya.  The  son  of 
392 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

Ikshwaku  was  named  Rukshi  and  his  son  was  Vikukshi,  whose 
son  was  the  resplendent  and  illustrious  King  Vana  and  the 
great  warrior  Anavanya  was  his  son.  During  the  reign  of  the 
virtuous  King  Anavanya  there  was  neither  famine  nor  scarcity 
of  rain  nor  any  thief.  The  son  of  Anavanya  was  Prithu  and 
his  son  was  Trishanku.  So  great  was  Trishanku's  observance 
of  truth  that  he  attained  heaven  in  his  embodied  state.  His  son 
was  the  mighty  Dhundhumara.  The  son  of  Dhundhumara 
was  Yuvanashwa  and  his  son  was  Mandhata.  The  illustrious 
Susandhi  was  the  son  of  Mandhata  and  Dhruvasandhi  and 
Frasenagita  were  the  offspring  of  Susandhi.  The  renowned 
Bharata  was  the  son  of  Dhruvasandhi  and  from  Bharata  sprang 
Ajita,  against  whom  the  great  kings,  Himaya,  Talagangha  and 
Shashavindu  declared  war.  Ajita  laid  siege  to  them  by  building 
fortifications,  but  found  their  defeat  beset  with  difficulties. 

"  Resigning  his  throne,  he  retired  to  the  delightful  Himalayas 
to  devote  himself  to  spiritual  practices.  It  is  said  that  one  of 
his  two  queens  was  pregnant  and  the  other  gave  her  poison 
to  destroy  the  foetus.  The  Queen  Kalindi  approached  the  Sage 
Chyavana,  the  son  of  Bhrigu,  who  resided  in  the  Himalayas 
at  that  time,  and  paid  him  respectful  homage.  He,  gratified, 
knowing  her  to  be  desirous  of  a  son,  said :  *  O  Goddess,  thou 
shalt  bring  forth  a  son  who  will  be  renowned,  virtuous, 
magnanimous,  of  excellent  conduct,  a  promoter  of  his  race 
and  a  subduer  of  bis  foes.* 

"  The  Queen  hearing  this,  saluted  the  rishi  with  reverence ; 
she  then  returned  home  and  brought  forth  a  son,  whose  eyes 
resembled  the  lotus  and  who  resembled  Brahma  in  splendour. 
Being  born  with  the  poison  that  her  fellow-consort  had  ad- 
ministered to  her,  Kalindi's  son  was  named  Sagara. 

"  Consecrated  at  a  fitting  season,  King  Sagara  drained  the 
ocean.  His  son  was  called  Asamanjas,  he  oppressed  the  people 
and  the  king  ordered  him  to  be  banished  on  account  of  his 
evil  ways.  The  son  of  Asamanjas  was  Anshuman  and  his  son 
was  Dilipa.  The  son  of  Dilipa  was  Bhagiratha.  The  son  of 
Bhagiratha  was  Kakustha  whose  son  was  Raghu  from  whom 
the  royal  line  has  since  been  named.  The  sons  of  Shri  Raghu 
were  known  by  the  names  of  Pravriddha,  Purushadaka,  Kalmasha- 
pada  and  Soudasa.  The  son  of  Kalmashapada  was  Shankhana

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

who  rising  to  great  power,  by  a  curse,  was  destroyed  wth  his 
whole  army.  The  mighty  hero  Sudarshana  was  the  son  of 
Shankhana  and  his  son  was  Agnivama  and  Agnivarna's  son  was 
Shighraga.  His  son  was  named  Meru,  and  Meru's  son  was 
Prashusvara,  and  his  son  was  the  great  Sage  Ambarisha.  The 
son  of  Ambarisha  was  the  truthful  Prince  Nahusha,  whose  son 
was  the  virtuous  Nabhaga.  Nabhaga  had  two  sons,  Aja  and 
Suvrata,  and  the  son  of  Aja  was  the  illustrious  sovereign 
Dasaratha.  Thou  art  the  son  of  the  great  monarch  Dasaratha 
renowned  all  through  the  world,  who  reigned  over  earth  and 
heaven. 

"  In  the  dynasty  of  Ikshwaku,  the  eldest  son  succeeds  to  the 
throne ;  while  the  eldest  son  lives,  none  else  can  become  king. 
It  is  not  meet  tor  thee  to  violate  this  sacred  tradition  of  the 
House  of  Raghu.  O  Great  One,  reign  over  this  earth  filled 
with  treasures  and  those  extensive  dominions  subject  to  thee, 
as  did  thy  sire  t " 


CHAPTER    III 

Prince  Bkarata  still  entreats  Shri  Rama  who  is  resolved 
to  follow  his  father's  command 

Having  spoken  thus,  Shri  Vasishtha  continued,  uttering  words 
of  wisdom.  "  O  Rama,  when  a  man  is  born,  he  must  regard 
as  his  teachers,  his  father,  his  mother  and  bis  spiritual  preceptor. 

"  O  Chief  of  Men,  the  parents  bestow  on  man  the  physical 
frame,  but  the  spiritual  preceptor  confers  wisdom  on  him,  and 
hence  he  is  called  Guru. 

"  I  am  the  preceptor  of  thy  father  and  of  thee,  mark  my 
counsel  and  do  not  over-ride  the  way  of  the  good.  O  My  Son, 
here  are  thy  relatives,  the  learned  brahmins  and  the  people 
of  the  capital,  as  also  the  warriors  and  merchants.  Fulfil  thy 
duty  to  them  and  do  not  exceed  the  limits  of  moral  obligation. 

"  Here  is  thy  pious  and  aged  mother,  whom  thou  shouldst 
not  disobey.  That  man  is  called  virtuous  who  renders  obedience 
to  his  mother.

"  O  Prince,  thou  shall  not  have  swerved  from  the  path  of 
righteous  action  by  acceding  to  Bharata's  request  that  thou 
shouldst  occupy  the  throne." 

Thus,  having  addressed  Rama  with  mildness,  the  holy  Guru 
Vasishtha  resumed  his  seat. 

The  mighty  Rama  then  made  answer,  saying :  "  The  good 
that  parents  do  to  their  son  cannot  easily  be  recompensed. 
In  childhood,  they  present  him  with  beautiful  attire  and 
delectable  dishes,  they  put  him  to  rest  and  tenderly  rub  his  body 
with  oil  of  sesamum  seed  and  manifest  affection  in  gentle 
counsels ;  further  they  strive  single-mindedly  for  his  ultimate 
good. 

"  The  commands  of  my  sire,  the  author  of  my  being,  shall 
not  be  set  aside." 

The  magnanimous  Bharata  hearing  these  words  of  Rama- 
chandra,  suffered  great  distress,  and  spoke  to  Sumantra,  saying : 
"  O  Charioteer,  prepare  a  seat  of  kusha  grass  on  this  trestle  seat, 
I  will  place  myself  before  Shri  Rama  till  he  be  pleased  to  grant 
my  request.  Like  a  brahmin,  who  is  destitute,  I  will  lie  at 
the  door  of  this  hut,  fasting  and  covering  my  face,  till  Shri  Rama 
consents  to  return  to  the  capital." 

Sumantra  looking  towards  Shri  Rama,  spread  the  kusha  grass, 
and  Prince  Bharata,  full  of  grief,  seated  himself  there,  before 
his  brother. 

Perceiving  this,  Shri  Rama,  chief  of  the  royal  sages,  said  to 
him :  "  O  Beloved  Bharata,  what  wrong  have  I  done  that  thou 
shouldst  sit  thus  before  me?  A  brahmin  may  adopt  this 
measure  towards  his  aggressor,  but  it  is  not  meet  that  a  crowned 
head  should  do  so.  O  Lion  among  Men,  rise,  abandon  this 
cruel  vow  and  return  speedily  to  the  capital." 

Bharata,  afflicted,  yet  resolute,  remaining  firm,  said  to  the 
people  of  the  capital  and  of  the  country  who  surrounded  him : 
"  Why  do  you  not  also  make  entreaty  to  Shri  Rama  ?  " 

Then  they  answered  saying :  "  We  are  unable  to  press 
Kakustha1  further,  since  he  is  resolved  to  follow  his  father's 
command." 

Rama  hearing  their  words  said  to  Bharata :  "  O  Prince, 
consider  the  words  of  thy  companions  versed  in  righteousness 

1  Kakustha — a  name  of  Rama,  as  descendant  of  King  Ikshwalcu. 

395 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  weigh  the  matter  carefully.  Having  reflected  on  their 
words  with  attention,  arise,  O  Raghava,  and  undergo  that  which 
shall  purify  thee  for  having  enacted  that  which  does  not  become 
a  warrior.    Do  thou  drink  water  and  touch  me  also." 

Bharata  rising,  said  :  "  Hear,  O  Brahmins,  Countrymen  and 
Warriors !  I  do  not  desire  the  kingdom  of  my  father,  I  did 
not  urge  my  mother  to  demand  it.  I  knew  naught  of  the  exile 
of  Shri  Rama.  If  it  be  required  that  someone  shall  dwell  in 
the  forest  in  obedience  to  my  father's  command,  then  will  I 
reside  there  for  fourteen  years  in  his  stead." 

Shri  Rama,  astonished  at  his  brother's  resolution,  addressed 
the  people  present,  saying :  "  Friends,  whatever  was  bought, 
pledged  or  sold  by  the  king  in  his  lifetime,  can  by  no  means 
be  cancelled  by  me  or  Bharata.  Neither  can  I  accept  contumely 
and  permit  Bharata  to  go  as  my  representative  to  the  forest. 
What  Kaikeyi  demanded  was  rightfully  granted  by  the  king. 

"  I  know  Bharata  to  be  disinterested  and  a  true  disciple  of 
his  Guru,  and  that  excellent  one  is  a  lover  of  truth.  I  herewith 
declare  that  on  my  return  from  the  forest,  I  shall  accept  the 
kingdom  and  with  my  virtuous  brother  govern  the  country 
with  honour. 

"  O  Bharata,  I  have  discharged  the  boon  granted  to  Kaikeyi 
by  the  king  and  vindicated  his  honour.  Do  thou  liberate  the 
king  from  the  charge  of  falsehood  and  redeem  the  second  boon." 


CHAPTER     112 

Following  the  advice  of  the  celestial  sages,  Prince  Bharata 
is  reconciled  to  becoming  Shri  Rama's  deputy 

The  great  sages  who  were  present  at  the  meeting  of  the  two 
illustrious  brothers,  were  astonished.  The  royal  sages,  those 
perfect  ones  also  celestial  beings,  who  were  invisible,  praised 
the  two  princes  and  said :  "  Blessed  is  the  king,  whose  sons 
are  highly  virtuous  and  veracious,  we  are  immeasurably  gratified 
to  hear  their  converse." 

396 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

Desirous  that  the  life  and  reign  of  Ravana  should  end  soon, 
certain  sages  approached  Bharata  and  unitedly  addressed  him, 
saying :  "  O  Bharata,  O  Highly  Resolute  Prince,  O  Pious  and 
Renowned  One,  recollect  that  thou  art  born  in  a  royal  line, 
let  not  the  word  of  Rama  be  disregarded  by  thee,  if  thou  art 
wishful  to  bring  felicity  to  the  spirit  of  thy  parent.  It  is  our  desire 
that  thy  father  who  has  entered  heaven  may  be  absolved  from 
every  debt,  having  discharged  his  obligations  to  Queen  Kaikeyi." 

Having  spoken  thus,  these  celestial  sages  returned  to  their 
abode. 

Rama,  gratified  by  their  words,  said :  "  By  you,  have  I  been 
assisted  in  upholding  virtue." 

Prince  Bharata  with  trembling  accents  again  entreated  Rama, 
saying :  "  O  Rama,  he  who  is  skilled  in  righteous  governance 
and  who  is  the  eldest,  ascends  the  throne.  Do  thou,  observing 
the  tradition,  fulfil  the  desire  of  thy  mother  Kaushalya.  I  alone 
have  neither  the  courage  to  administer  so  vast  a  dominion, 
nor  should  I  be  able  to  satisfy  the  people  of  the  capital  and 
kingdom. 

"  Our  relatives,  friends,  and  warriors  await  thy  conversion 
to  sovereignty  as  the  husbandman  eagerly  anticipates  the  rain 
clouds.  Therefore,  O  Wise  One,  accept  the  crown  for  thou 
alone  art  able  to  establish  this  kingdom." 

Having  spoken  thus,  Bharata  fell  at  the  feet  of  his  brother 
and  fervently  entreated  him,  crying :  "  O  Rama,  O  Rama." 

Shri  Rama,  raising  up  the  young  prince  who,  eloquent  and 
lotus-eyed,  resembled  a  wild  swan  embraced  him,  and  said : 
*'  That  genuine  humility  which  thou  hast  demonstrated  will 
furnish  thee  with  sufficient  courage  to  govern  the  kingdom. 
Do  thou  consult  thy  ministers,  counsellors  and  friends  in  the 
great  work  of  thy  rule.  The  moon  may  cease  from  shining, 
and  the  Himalaya  abandon  the  snows,  Mount  Meru  its  splendour 
or  the  ocean  exceed  its  boundary,  but  I  shall  not  relinquish 
the  vow  made  in  the  presence  of  my  sire.  O  Beloved  One, 
it  is  not  for  thee  to  determine  whether  that  which  was  brought 
about  by  thy  mother  was  done  through  love  of  thee,  or  through 
ambition  to  see  thee  made  king,  it  is  for  thee  to  treat  her  as 
thy  parent." 

Then  Prince  Bharata  answered  Rama  who  resembled  the  sun 
397 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

in  glory  and  the  new  moon  in  splendour,  saying :  "  O  Noble 
One,  place  thy  feet  in  these  sandals  adorned  with  gold,  since 
soon  they  will  furnish  our  only  means  of  support  and  protection." 

The  illustrious  Rama  having  put  on  the  sandals,  took  them 
off  and  returned  them  to  Bharata.  He,  bowing  reverently  to 
the  sandals  addressed  Rama  thus :  "  From  to-day  I  shall  for 
fourteen  years,  assuming  matted  locks  and  a  robe  of  bark,  live 
on  fruits  and  roots,  awaiting  thy  return.  Offering  up  the 
management  of  the  kingdom  to  these  sandals  for  fourteen  years, 
if  I  do  not  see  thee  returning  on  the  final  day  of  that  period, 
I  will  enter  the  fire  and  be  consumed  !  " 

Shri  Rama  embracing  Bharata  with  great  reverence  answered 
"  Be  it  so."  Then  he  spoke  further  saying :  "  Cherish  thy 
mother  Kaikeyi,  and  be  not  angry  with  her.  In  my  name  and 
in  the  name  of  Shri  Sita,  I  adjure  thee  to  reverence  and  protect 
Queen  Kaikeyi ! "  His  eyes  suffused  with  tears,  Shri  Rama 
then  bade  farewell  to  Shri  Bharata  and  Shatrughna. 

Bharata  offering  due  reverence  to  the  ornate  and  glittering 
sandals,  circumambulated  Shri  Rama  and  placed  them  on  the 
head  of  the  mighty  elephant  belonging  to  King  Dasaratha. 
Then  Shri  Rama,  immoveable  like  the  Himalayas,  in  the  practice 
of  virtue  and  the  promoter  of  the  honour  of  the  House  of  Raghu, 
made  obeisance  to  his  holy  Guru,  the  ministers,  citizens  and 
his  brothers,  and  dismissed  them. 

His  mothers,  overcome  with  grief,  were  unable  to  utter 
a  single  word.  To  them  also  Shri  Rama  offered  reverent 
salutations  and  sorrowfully  entered  his  own  dwelling. 


CHAPTER     113 

Prince  Bharata  commences  the  return  journey 

Then  Shri  Bharata,  fully  reconciled,  taking  the  sandals  from 
the  head  of  the  elephant,  placed  them  on  his  own  and  ascended 
the  chariot  with  Shatrughna,  Shri  Vasishtha,  Vamadeva  and 
Javali  of  firm  vows,  with  all  the  sagacious  counsellors  preceding 
398

him.  Circulating  the  Mount  Chittrakuta,  they  proceeded 
towards  the  east,  by  the  river  Mandakini,  where  they  beheld 
countless  veins  of  metal. 

Shri  Bharata  with  his  army,  went  forward  and  at  a  short 
distance  from  Chittrakuta,  perceived  the  hermitage  in  which 
the  holy  Bharadwaja  and  other  sages  dwelt.  Approaching  the 
hermitage  of  the  Sage  Bharadwaja,  Shri  Bharata  having  dis- 
mounted from  his  chariot,  offered  salutations  to  him.  Bharadwaja, 
full  of  joy,  said  to  Bharata  :  "  O  Friend,  hast  thou  beheld  Shri 
Rama  ?    Is  thy  purpose  accomplished  ?  " 

Shri  Bharata,  ever  devoted  to  his  brother,  answered  the  sage, 
saying :  "  O  Lord,  I  and  the  holy  Guru  Vasishtha  besought 
Rama  to  return,  but  he  cheerfully  replied  :  '  My  father's  decree 
that  I  should  reside  in  the  forest  for  fourteen  years,  shall  be 
faithfully  observed  by  me  \" 

Then  the  learned  and  eloquent  Shri  Vasishtha,  skilled  in 
wisdom,  addressed  Shri  Rama  in  this  wise :  "  O  Wise  One, 
be  pleased  to  bestow  thy  sandals,  adorned  with  gems,  on  thy 
deputy.    Do  thou  bear  the  good  of  the  capital  in  thy  heart. 

Shri  Rama,  in  obedience  to  his  holy  Guru,  turning  towards 
the  east,  put  on  the  sandals  and  thereafter  delivered  them 
tome. 

"  Now,  frustrated  in  my  design  to  bring  back  Shri  Rama, 
I  am  returning  to  Ayodhya  with  these  sandals." 

The  Maharishi  Bharadwaja,  then  uttered  these  auspicious 
words :  "  O  Prince,  versed  in  the  knowledge  of  virtue,  thine 
excellence  is  as  little  a  source  of  wonder,  as  water  ever  flowing 
towards  a  hollow.  King  Dasaratha,  possessed  of  a  righteous 
and  duty-loving  son,  such  as  thou  art,  has  surely  found 
immortality." 

Shri  Bharata,  touching  the  feet  of  the  holy  rishi,  in  great 
reverence,  with  joined  palms,  circumambulated  him  and  then, 
with  his  counsellors,  proceeded  to  Ayodhya. 

The  army  following  Prince  Bharata,  some  riding  elephants, 
some  horses,  and  some  in  bullock  carts,  crossed  the  Yamuna 
with  its  singing  waves  and  came  to  the  sacred  waters  of  the 
Ganges. 

Having  crossed  the  holy  river  Gunga,  with  his  companions, 
Shri  Bharata  entered  the  town  of  Shringavera  and  from  there 
399  an 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

passed  on  to  Ayodhya.  Beholding  Ayodhya,  a  stricken  city, 
deserted  by  bis  father,  King  Dasaratha  and  his  brother  Shri 
Ramachandra,  Prince  Bharata,  deeply  distressed,  said  to  his 
charioteer :  "  Behold  the  ruined  capital  bereft  of  its  former 
glory,  unadorned  and  lacking  all  signs  of  festivity !  How  silent, 
how  wretched  is  this  city,  formerly  so  full  of  life." 


CHAPTER     X  I  4 

He  finds  Ayodkya  desolate 

The  prince,  in  his  chariot,  which  gave  forth  a  thunderous  sound 
as  it  rolled  onward,  entered  Ayodhya.  There  he  beheld  the  city 
where  cats  and  owls  ranged,  and  where  the  doors  of  the  dwellings 
were  closed,  darkness  and  gloom  reigning  over  all.  The  city 
resembling  the  planet  Rohini,1  that  has  lost  its  splendour  on 
the  moon's  eclipse,  or  a  mountain  stream,  whose  waters  have 
dried  up  in  the  sun's  heat,  deserted  by  the  waterfowl,  the  fishes 
all  having  perished. 

Sad  and  wretched,  on  account  of  its  separation  from  Rama, 
Ayodhya  resembled  the  sacrificial  flame,  which  when  the  oblation 
is  poured  into  it,  shines  like  a  golden  cone  and  then  sinks  into 
smoking  ash,  or  like  a  mighty  army  divested  of  its  weapons 
in  battle,  its  horses,  elephants,  chariots  and  standards  scattered 
abroad  and  its  heroic  warriors  slain.  That  city  which  looked, 
as  it  were,  like  the  waves  of  the  sea  whipped  into  foam  by 
the  storm,  rolling  and  breaking  and  then  sinking  into  silence 
with  the  dying  out  of  the  wind,  or  like  the  sacrificial  pavilion 
deserted  by  the  priests  who  go  forth  in  search  of  alms  after  the 
sacrifice ;  or  lite  kine  bereft  of  the  bull,  who  have  ceased  to  graze 
in  the  pasture  and  stand  in  the  enclosure  dispirited ;  or  like  a  neck- 
lace stripped  of  its  precious  gems ;  or  like  a  meteor,  its  virtue 
exhausted,  fallen  to  earth,  deprived  of  its  splendour ;  or  like 
a  flowering  branch,  loaded  with  blossom  in  the  Spring,  visited 

1  Rohini— The  constellation  of  five  stars  (Taurus)  containing  Aldebaran, 
which  star  is  probably  meant  here.  Called  the  "  Red  One  "  and  said  to  be 
the  favourite  consort  of  the  moon. 

400 


AYODHYA    KANDA 
by  a  swarm  of  bees,  that  is  suddenly  consumed  by  a  forest 
fire. 

The  streets  were  deserted  and  the  fairs  and  markets  closed, 
and  no  merchandise  was  offered  for  sale.  Dark  and  fearful, 
Ayodhya  resembled  the  moon  and  stars  obscured  by  heavy  clouds 
in  the  rainy  season,  or  a  deserted  tavern,  its  revellers  departed, 
the  liquor  expended  and  naught  but  fragments  of  broken  glass 
and  pots  in  wild  disorder  scattered  here  and  there.  Ayodhya 
appeared  like  a  tank  sunk  into  the  earth,  the  water  being  spent, 
the  foundations  having  collapsed,  the  jars  and  earthen  vessels 
lying  scattered  amidst  the  thirsty,  standing  there  in  despair ;  or 
it  resembled  the  string  of  a  great  hero's  bow  that  has  been 
severed  by  the  arrow  of  his  adversary  and  is  lying  on  the  earth ; 
or  an  aged  and  ill-nourished  mule,  urged  on  by  a  soldier,  slain 
in  the  battle  and  left  unheeded. 

Viewing  the  desolation,  Prince  Bharata,  seated  in  his  chariot, 
spoke  to  Sumantra,  who  was  driving  the  equipage :  "Alas ! 
How  sad  that  this  city,  formerly  so  gay,  to-day  appears  so 
melancholy,  the  intoxicating  fragrance  of  floral  garlands  and 
the  scent  of  incense,  no  longer  filling  it.  O  Sumantra,  I  do 
not  hear,  as  formerly,  the  sound  of  clattering  chariots,  the 
neighing  of  horses  and  the  prolonged  roaring  of  elephants. 
Alas  !  Since  Rama  departed,  the  young  men  of  Ayodhya  have 
ceased  to  adorn  themselves  with  garlands  of  fresh  blossoms  and 
sandalwood  and  men  no  longer  walk  abroad  decked  with  flowers. 
No  longer  are  festivals  observed  and  the  people  of  the  capital 
are  merged  in  grief;  it  seems  as  if  the  glory  of  the  city  had 
departed  with  Rama.  O  !  Ayodhya  is  bereft  of  light,  like  the 
night  overcast  with  clouds  at  the  time  of  the  waxing  moon. 
When  will  my  brother,  Ramachandra,  return  like  a  festival, 
diffusing  joy  in  Ayodhya,  as  do  the  autumnal  rains  ?  Formerly, 
the  royal  highways  of  the  capital  were  filled  with  richly  attired 
youths,  but  to-day  they  are  all  deserted." 

Wailing  and  lamenting,  Prince  Bharata  entered  his  father's 
palace,  which,  bereft  of  the  king,  resembled  a  cave  without 
a  lion. 

Seeing  the  inner  compartment  in  complete  darkness,  the  prince 
wept  aloud,  like  the  gods,  when  warring  with  the  titans,  arc 
afflicted  when  beholding  the  darkening  of  the  sun.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER    115 

Prince  Bharata  retires  to  Nandigrama  and  rules  the  kingdom 
from  that  city 

The  sorrowing  Bharata,  firm  in  his  resolve,  having  brought  his 
mothers  back  to  Ayodhya,  said  to  the  holy  Guru  Vasishtha 
and  the  elders : — 

"  I  crave  your  permission  to  retire  to  Nandigrama  and  there 
endure  the  woes  occasioned  by  Shri  Rama's  absence.  The  king 
has  departed  and  my  elder  brother  has  entered  the  forest.  I 
shall,  therefore,  await  the  return  of  Shri  Rama,  since  verily 
he  alone  is  Lord  of  Ayodhya." 

Shri  Vasishtha  and  the  counsellors,  hearing  the  words  of 
Prince  Bharata,  answered  him  saying :  "  O  Prince,  thy  words, 
inspired  by  devotion  to  thy  brother,  are  worthy  of  praise. 
Verily,  they  do  thee  honour !  Who  will  dare  oppose  thee, 
who  art  deeply  attached  to  thy  brother  and  who,  in  this  land, 
has  reached  such  an  exalted  state  ?  " 

Perceiving  the  counsellors  reconciled  to  his  purpose,  the  prince 
said  to  Sumantra  :  "  Bring  hither  the  chariot ! " 

The  chariot  having  come,  Bharata,  after  conversing  with  his 
mothers,  mounted  the  equipage  with  his  brother  Shatrughna. 
Accompanied  by  the  priests  and  ministers,  the  two  princes 
cheerfully  proceeded  to  Nandigrama,  the  Guru  Vasishtha  and 
the  pious  brahmins  leading  the  procession. 

Then  the  army,  elephants,  horses  and  chariots  together  with 
the  people  of  the  capital,  followed  him  unbidden.  The  peerless 
Bharata  filled  with  fraternal  love,  carrying  the  sandals  of  Shri 
Rama  on  his  head,  at  last  reached  Nandigrama.  Dismounting 
from  the  chariot,  he  addressed  his  spiritual  preceptor  and  the 
elders,  saying :  "  My  brother,  Shri  Rama,  gave  this  kingdom 
to  me,  as  a  precious  trust,  verily  these  sandals,  decorated  with 
gold  shall  represent  him." 

Once  more  lifting  the  sandals  reverently  to  his  head,  he 

addressed  the  people  of  the  capital,  saying :    "  Ye  Men  of 

Ayodhya,  accept  these  sandals  as  symbols  of  the  feet  of  Shri 

402 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

Rama.  Let  them  rest  beneath  the  royal  canopy  and  wave  the 
chamara  over  them.  These  are  the  sandals  of  our  supreme 
Guru  and  by  them  will  righteousness  be  established  in  the 
kingdom.  I  shall  preserve  the  trust  lovingly  reposed  in  me 
by  Rama,  till  his  return.  When  he  returns  to  Ayodhya,  I, 
myself,  will  assist  him  to  put  on  the  sandals.  Then  I,  united 
with  him  once  more,  will  deliver  the  kingdom  to  him  and  like 
a  son  will  I  honour  him.  By  restoring  the  capital  and  kingdom 
to  Rama,  I  shall  wash  away  the  stigma  of  dishonour  brought 
on  me  by  my  mother.  Shri  Rama  will  be  installed  and  his 
subjects  made  happy ;  then  shall  ill-fame  pass  away,  and  1  shall 
win  exceeding  honour  from  the  people." 

Thus  lamenting,  the  afflicted  Bharata,  with  the  assistance  of 
his  counsellors,  retired  to  Nandigrama  and  ruled  the  kingdom 
from  that  city.  With  matted  locks,  assuming  the  bark  dress 
of  an  ascetic,  Shri  Bharata  dwelt  in  Nandigrama,  protected  by 
bis  army. 

Residing  in  Nandigrama,  obedient  to  Shri  Rama  and  faithful 
to  his  promise,  Shri  Bharata,  placing  the  sandals  on  the  royal 
throne,  spreading  the  canopy  over  them  and  waving  the  chamara 
above  them,  committed  the  seals  of  the  kingdom  to  their  keeping, 
he,  himself,  passing  his  life  as  a  servant  of  Rama. 

Every  matter  of  import  and  all  the  business  of  state  was  first 
laid  before  the  sandals,  and  every  gift  brought  to  the  king  was 
first  offered  to  them,  and  afterwards  treated  as  occasion  required. 


CHAPTER     I  I  6 

The  holy  men  of  Chittrakuta  depart,  fearing  the  coming 
oppression  of  the  asuras 

Bharata  having  departed  to  Ayodhya,  Shri  Rama  perceived 
that  the  ascetics  living  on  Chittrakuta  were  filled  with  apprehen- 
sion and  desirous  of  withdrawing  from  that  place. 

Formerly,  these  holy  men  dwelling  in  Chittrakuta  looked  for 
Shri  Rama's  protection,  but  now  they  sought  to  take  their 
403 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

departure.  By  the  expression  in  their  eyes  and  other  signs, 
they  manifested  their  misgivings  and  could  be  observed  convers- 
ing secretly  in  low  tones  with  one  another. 

Shri  Rama,  beholding  their  anxiety  addressed  them  with 
humility,  saying :  "  O  Blessed  Ones,  has  my  conduct  towards 
you  suffered  a  change  ?  For  what  reason  are  your  hearts  filled 
with  dread  ?  O  Holy  Ones,  has  my  younger  brother  involunt- 
arily injured  you  ?  Or  has  Shri  Sita,  ever  devoted  to  my  service, 
given  you  cause  for  offence  ?  Perchance  she  has  done  that 
which  is  not  fitting  for  a  woman  ?  " 

Thus  questioned,  a  great  sage,  an  aged  ascetic,  his  frame 
emaciated  by  austerities,  tremblingly  answered  the  Ever- 
Compassionate  One,  saying  :  "  O  Child,  bounteous  to  all  that 
lives,  Shri  Sita  is  innocent  of  any  breach  of  the  traditional 
attitude  to  any,  least  of  all  towards  holy  men.  In  truth,  the 
reason  is  that  the  asuras,  through  enmity  to  thee,  have  begun 
to  oppress  the  sages,  and  therefore,  they  being  terrified,  seek 
how  they  may  defend  themselves  in  secret. 

"  Ravana's  younger  brother  Kara,  who  dwells  here,  is  casting 
out  the  ascetics  from  their  hermitages.  O  Friend,  he  is  in- 
exorable and  he  is  a  mighty  warrior.  He  is  brutal  and  cannot 
endure  thy  presence  here.  Since  thou  hast  come  to  dwell  in 
this  hermitage,  the  asuras  have  increased  the  persecution  of 
the  sages.  Appearing  in  grotesque  and  terrible  forms,  they  fill 
them  with  terror,  then  to  do  them  further  mischief,  they  fling 
unclean  and  inauspicious  objects  into  the  sacred  precincts, 
finally  when  meeting  with  guileless  and  pure-hearted  hermits, 
they  slay  them.  Those  evil-hearted  asuras  wander  everywhere 
covertly,  till  perceiving  a  sage  to  be  alone  and  defenceless,  they 
put  an  end  to  his  life. 

"At  the  time  of  sacrifice,  when  the  sacred  fire  is  kindled  by 
the  ascetics,  then  do  the  asuras,  scattering  the  hallowed  vessels 
and  ladles,,  quench  the  fire  by  discharging  water  over  it  and 
destroying  the  utensils.  O  Shri  Ramachandra,  weary  of  these 
wicked  asuras,  the  sages  are  urging  us  to  abandon  these 
hermitages  and  depart  hence. 

"  O  Rama,  those  terrible  asuras  threaten  to  slay  us  all, 

therefore,  we  are  leaving  this  hermitage.    Not  far  distant  is 

the  wonderful  Tapovana  belonging  to  the  Maharishi  Ashwa ; 

404 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

it  is  rich  in  fruits  and  roots,  there  we  would  dwell.  O  Friend, 
if  it  seem  proper  to  thee,  do  thou  come  there,  for  thine  oppression 
is  also  planned. 

"  O  Prince,  though  thou  art  able  to  defend  thyself,  thy  sojourn 
here  with  thy  holy  consort  is  fraught  with  peril." 

Hearing  the  words  of  Kulupati  and  perceiving  their  anxiety 
to  be  gone,  Shri  Rama  sought  to  persuade  them  to  stay,  but 
in  vain,  and  the  sages  departed.  Shri  Rama  accompanied  them 
a  short  distance  then,  taking  leave  of  them  and  offering  obeisance 
to  them,  returned  to  his  sacred  dwelling.  On  leaving  the  holy 
men,  they  instructed  him  lovingly  in  the  path  of  duty  and 
bade  him  farewell. 

Shri  Rama  did  not  then  abandon  the  hermitage,  which  the 
sages  had  deserted.  Among  them  were  a  few  who,  inspired 
by  Rama's  example,  had  surrendered  their  hearts  to  him,  and 
of  them  the  prince  was  ever  mindful. 


CHAPTER    117 

Shri  Rama  decides  to  leave  the  hermitage  and  comes  to 
the  ashrama  of  the  Sage  Atri 

The  rishis,  having  left  the  hermitage,  Shri  Rama  reflected  on 
the  matter  and  judged  it  wisest  not  to  dwell  there  longer. 

Remembrance  of  his  people,  his  mothers  and  Prince  Bharata 
who  had  been  united  with  him  there,  caused  him  unending 
distress.  Further,  the  elephants  and  horses  of  Bharata's  army 
had  defiled  and  laid  waste  the  ground,  rendering  it  squalid  and 
foul.  On  mature  reflection,  he  thought  "  We  will  depart 
hence  "  and  taking  Shri  Sits  and  Lakshmana  with  him,  he  left 
that  place. 

Proceeding  further,  he  came  to  the  ashrama  of  the  Sage  Atri, 

and  made  obeisance  to  him,  that  holy  one  regarding  him  with 

a  fatherly  affection.    He  bestowed  his  favour  likewise  on  Sita 

and  Lakshmana  and  treated  Rama  with  the  hospitality  due  to  him. 

405 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

The  virtuous  Sage  Atri,  ever  devoted  to  the  good  of  all, 
summoned  his  aged  and  pious  wife  Anasuya,  and  respectfully 
asking  her  to  be  seated,  addressed  his  worthy  and  excellent 
spouse.  He  said :  "  Shri  Sita  has  visited  our  hermitage,  do 
thou  take  her  with  thee  and  receive  her  hospitably." 

Then  the  Sage  Atri  said  to  Ramachandra :  "  Formerly  when 
rain  was  withheld  for  a  period  of  ten  years  and  the  earth  dried 
up,  this  virtuous  woman,  Anasuya,  by  her  great  austerity, 
produced  fruits  and  berries  for  the  sages  and  caused  the  sacred 
Ganges  to  descend  so  that  they  might  bathe  therein ;  thus  by 
her  arduous  ascetic  practices,  did  she  dispel  the  impediments 
in  the  path  of  the  sages.  O  Sinless  Rama,  this  is  the  same 
Anasuya,  who  at  one  time,  to  succour  the  sages,  caused  ten 
nights  to  be  reduced  to  one.  This  Anasuya  is  to  be  highly 
revered  for  her  age's  sake,  and  is  the  object  of  reverence  of  all 
beings.  Do  thou  permit  the  Princess  Sita  to  accompany  the 
meek  and  aged  Anasuya.  By  her  great  and  noble  deeds,  she 
has  acquired  immeasurable  tame.    Let  Janaki  attend  her." 

Then  Shri  Ramachandra  answered,  "  Be  it  so,"  and  the 
illustrious  prince  said  to  Sita :  "  O  Princess,  thou  hast  heard 
the  words  spoken  by  the  sage ;  for  thine  own  good  do  thou  wait 
on  this  aged  ascetic." 

Thereafter,  Shri  Sita  went  with  Anasuya  who  was  proficient 
in  every  virtue.  On  account  of  her  age,  her  physical  form  was 
feeble  and  emaciated,  her  hair  grey,  whilst  her  body  trembled 
like  a  palm  tree  agitated  by  a  strong  wind. 

Uttering  her  name,  Shri  Sita  made  obeisance  to  her,  the  gentle 
saint  returning  her  salutation  with  great  humility  enquiring  as 
to  her  welfare.  The  aged  Anasuya,  beholding  Shri  Sita  offering 
humble  obeisance,  spoke  encouraging  words,  saying : — 

"  O  Sita,  fortunate  art  thou,  that  thou  art  attentive  to  the 
duties  owed  to  thy  consort.  It  is  supremely  auspicious  that 
thou,  forsaking  thy  people,  thy  individual  comfort,  thy  wealth 
and  thy  possessions  shouldst  accompany  thy  husband  to  the  forest. 

"  She  who  is  devoted  to  her  spouse,  whether  in  the  city  or 

the  forest,  regardless  whether  he  be  a  sinner  or  virtuous,  that 

woman  attains  the  highest  region.    Whether  a  husband  be  cruel, 

or  the  slave  of  desires,  or  poor,  a  virtuous  wife  will  continue 

406 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

to  worship  him  as  a  god.  O  Princess,  I  have  studied  deeply 
and  I  do  not  think  that  a  woman  can  have  a  better  friend  than 
her  husband,  for  he,  in  all  circumstances,  protects  her. 

"  O  Princess  of  Videha,  those  evil  women  who,  enslaved  by 
desire,  do  not  regard  what  should  or  should  not  be  done,  O 
Princess  of  Mithila,  they,  imprudently  commit  unworthy  acts 
and  becoming  abhorrent,  fall  from  virtue.  But  women  such 
as  thou,  acquainted  with  what  is  good  or  evil  in  the  world,  like 
pious  men,  attain  heaven.  O  Sati,  thou  hast  ever  been  faithful 
to  thy  conjugal  duty  and  through  thy  virtuous  acts,  undertaken 
in  conjunction  with  thy  husband,  shalt  attain  merit  and  fame." 


CHAPTER     I  I  8 

Princess  Sita  receives  gifts  of  love  from  the  sage's  wife 

The  blameless  Anasuya  having  spoken,  Shri  Sita,  approving 
her  words,  gently  answered :  "  O  Noble  Lady,  the  advice  thou 
hast  given  me,  is  in  no  wise  a  source  of  wonder  to  me,  for  it  is 
my  conviction  that  the  husband  is  in  authority  over  his  wife. 
Even  if  the  husband  be  poor  and  ignorant,  yet  women,  such 
as  I,  should  feel  no  aversion  for  him. 

"  But  the  husband  who  is  worthy  of  praise  on  account  of 
his  excellent  qualities  and  who  is  compassionate,  self-controlled, 
constant  in  his  affections,  fully  acquainted  with  his  duty  and 
who  manifests  the  loving-kindness  of  a  parent,  excels  all 
expectation. 

"  Whatever  love  Shri  Ramachandra  bears  to  bis  mother 
Kaushalya,  he  bestows  equally  on  the  other  queens,  and  not 
this  alone,  but  whoever  the  king  has  looked  on  with  affection, 
that  woman  he  also  regards  as  his  own  mother. 

"  When  departing  for  the  fearful  forest,  my  mother-in-law, 
Queen  Kaushalya,  imparted  certain  instruction  to  me,  and  I 
inscribed  her  words  on  the  tablet  of  my  heart.  I  call  to  mind 
also  the  advice  given  me  by  mine  own  mother  at  the  time  of 
my  nuptials. 

4<>7 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  O  Righteous  One,  the  crowning  discipline  for  a  woman 
is  the  service  of  her  lord.  To-day,  thou  hast  awakened  in  my 
memory  the  counsels  formerly  given  to  me  by  my  relatives. 

"To-day,  Savitri  dwells  in  heaven  through  the  service  of  her 
spouse,  thou  also  shalt  enter  the  supreme  abode  through  service 
of  thy  lord.  Rohini,  a  pearl  among  women  and  a  dweller  in 
the  celestial  region,  ever  accompanies  the  moon.  Thus  many 
others  who  have  followed  virtue,  with  fixed  resolve,  enter  heaven 
through  their  merits." 

Anasuya  rejoiced  to  hear  Sita's  words  and  kissing  her  head 
in  benediction,  said :  "  O  Sita,  much  merit  has  accrued  to  me 
by  prayer  and  fasting.  O  Princess,  pure  in  heart,  I  desire  to 
confer  a  boon  on  thee  by  virtue  of  these  merits.  Tell  me  what 
thou  dost  desire  ?  O  Princess  of  Mithila,  thy  words  have  given 
me  extreme  satisfaction.  Now  say  what  good  I  may  accomplish 
in  thy  name." 

Shri  Sita,  hearing  the  words  of  the  pious  Anasuya,  versed 
in  domestic  duty,  and  being  filled  with  astonishment,  answered 
smilingly :  "Thy  loving  kindness  has  already  fulfilled  my  every 
desire." 

Shri  Anasuya  hearing  these  words  was  gratified  in  greater 
measure  and  said :  "  O  Sita,  fortunate  am  I  to  behold  thee  I 
Let  my  joy  bear  fruit,  ask  a  boon.  I  can  give  thee  celestial 
garlands,  apparel  and  precious  unguents  to  adorn  thy  person. 
O  Daughter  of  Janaka,  my  gifts  would  enhance  thy  beauty, 
they  will  never  fade  and  they  will  become  thee  well.  Apply 
this  powder  which  I  now  give  to  thee ;  thou  shalt,  by  this, 
augment  thy  husband's  beauty  as  Lakshmi  increases  the  glory 
of  the  imperishable  Vishnu." 

The  princess  accepted  the  robes,  powder  and  ornaments, 
gifts  of  love,  from  the  ascetic  The  illustrious  Sita,  having 
received  the  symbols  of  affection  from  Anasuya,  sat  down  near 
her  with  joined  palms. 

Then  Anasuya  requested  Shri  Sita  to  relate  something  of 
moment,  saying :  "  O  Sita,  I  have  heard  a  brief  account  of 
thy  wedding,  describe  it  to  me  now  in  detail." 

Shri  Sita  obediently  answered :  "  Hear  me,  and  I  will  relate 
it  all  to  thee.  The  King  of  Mithila,  that  brave  and  virtuous 
monarch,  Janaka,  the  protector  of  his  people  as  befits  a  warrior, 
408 


AYODHYA    KANDA 

once,  when  ploughing  the  earth  to  establish  sacrificial  ground, 
beheld  me  like  a  daughter  emerging  from  the  furrow.  At  that 
time,  the  king  repeating  the  holy  texts,  was  scattering  the  seed 
of  herbs  and,  seeing  my  body  besmeared  with  dust,  was 
astonished.  Being  without  issue,  he  took  me  in  his  arms  and 
said,  *  This  shall  be  my  daughter ',  and  treated  me  with  extreme 
love.  Then  a  voice  rang  out  from  the  heavens,  saying :  *  O 
King,  verily  she  is  thy  daughter.* 

"  The  king  rejoiced  in  my  possession  and  since  my  birth  his 
prosperity  has  increased.  That  sovereign,  constant  in  the 
performance  of  sacrifice,  gave  me  into  the  care  of  his  chief  queen, 
she  nourishing  me  with  maternal  affection.  When  I  came  to 
maturity,  my  father  grew  anxious,  like  an  indigent  man  who 
is  bereft  of  all  he  possesses. 

"  The  lather  of  a  daughter,  be  he  equal  to  Indra,  must  defer 
to  his  son-in-law,  whether  in  status  he  be  his  peer  or  his  inferior. 
My  father  was  willing  to  submit  to  this  eventuality  and  was 
consumed  with  anxiety,  as  one  desirous  of  crossing  a  river, 
who  finds  himself  without  the  means  of  transport. 

"After  much  seeking,  he  was  unable  to  find  a  suitable  bride- 
groom and  was  beset  with  fears.  On  profound  reflection,  he 
resolved  to  convene  a  meeting  of  princes,  that  I  might  elect 
a  husband. 

"  In  ancient  days,  on  the  occasion  of  a  sacrifice,  one  of  our 
royal  forbears  received  from  Varuna,  a  great  bow  with  two 
quivers  that  should  never  lack  arrows.  The  bow  was  so  heavy 
that  many  persons  together  could  not  move  it  and  no  monarch 
could  draw  it,  even  in  dream. 

'*  By  his  merit,  my  honoured  sire  had  acquired  the  bow  and 
he,  summoning  the  kings  in  council,  addressed  them,  saying : 
*  Ye  Sovereigns  of  Men,  I  will  give  my  daughter  in  marriage 
to  him  who  is  able  to  lift  up  and  string  this  bow.' 

"  The  kings,  beholding  the  bow  resembling  a  mountain  in 
weight,  unable  to  lift  it  up,  made  obeisance  to  it  and  went 
their  way. 

"After  a  long  time,  the  resplendent  Ramachandra  came  to 
my  father's  sacrifice  in  company  with  the  Sage  Vishwamitra. 
The  king,  my  father,  offered  that  truth-loving  hero  together 
with  the  Sage  Vishwamitra,  abundant  hospitality. 
409 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Then  Shri  Vishwamitra  said  to  the  king :  *  These  are  the 
two  sons  of  King  Dasaratha,  who  desire  to  see  the  bow.  Be 
gracious  enough  to  allow  these  two  princes  to  view  it.* 

"  King  Janaka  commanded  the  bow  to  be  brought  as  requested 
by  the  Sage  Vishwamitra. 

"  In  an  instant,  Shri  Ramachandra,  lifting  the  bow,  drew  it. 
Having  been  bent  by  the  thong,  the  bow  broke  in  two,  creating 
a  sound  like  the  crash  of  thunder.  Thereafter,  my  honoured 
father  caused  water  to  be  brought  and  offered  to  Shri  Rama- 
chandra and  prepared  to  bestow  me  on  him,  but  Shri 
Ramachandra  did  not  consent  to  accept  my  hand  till  the  inten- 
tions of  his  own  father  were  known. 

"  King  Janaka  then  requested  the  aged  King  Dasaratha  to 
come  thither  and  he,  acquiescing  in  the  matter,  did  so.  With 
his  approval  I  was  pledged  to  the  great-souled  Ramachandra ; 
my  younger  sister,  a  guileless  girl,  Urmila,  being  wedded  to 
Shri  Lakshmana. 

"  O  Great  Ascetic,  thus  was  I  bestowed  in  marriage  and 
since  then  have  taken  extreme  delight  in  ministering  to  my 
Lord,  Shri  Ramachandra,  as  is  my  duty." 


CHAPTER    119 

The  holy  ascetics  bless  the  exiles  who  enter  the  forest 

Shri  Anasuya,  faithful  to  duty,  listened  to  this  stirring  narrative 
and,  taking  hold  of  Shri  Sita's  hands,  embraced  her,  savouring 
the  fragrance  of  her  locks,  then  she  addressed  her,  saying :  "  I 
have  heard  thy  tale  brilliantly  and  lucidly  set  forth,  which  thou 
hast  so  singularly  related  to  me.  O  Sweet-speaking  One,  I 
would  tain  hear  more  of  thy  story,  but  the  sun  has  gone  down 
behind  the  Asatalachala  mountain  and  the  lovely  night  is  near 
at  hand.  See  t  the  birds  who  have  sought  food  far  and  wide 
all  the  day,  are  now  returning  home  to  rest.  Hark !  how 
they  sing !  The  holy  ascetics,  too,  are  returning  from  their 
bathing  in  their  wet  robes  of  bark  with  loshtas  in  their  hands.

The  smoke,  in  hue  resembling  a  pigeon's  neck,  rising  from 
the  Sages'  sacred  fires  is  being  driven  by  the  wind  here  and 
there.  The  bare  trees,  scarcely  seen  in  the  distance,  appear 
like  dense  clouds  in  the  gathering  darkness.  The  light  is  slowly 
fading  in  every  quarter.  See,  the  rangers  of  the  night  are 
abroad  and  the  deer  of  the  Tapovana  forest  are  sleeping  round 
the  sacred  altars.  Behold  !  O  Sita  !  The  night  adorned  with 
stars  is  come  and  the  moon  diffusing  her  light  has  appeared 
in  the  heavens. 

"Do  thou  go,  O  Princess,  and  minister  to  thy  lord,  Shri 
Ramachandra.  How  fortunate  am  I  to  have  had  sweet  converse 
with  thee !  O  Princess,  do  thou  attire  thyself  in  these  robes 
and  ornaments,  and  thus  increase  my  delight." 

Shri  Sita  adorning  herself  in  the  gorgeous  apparel,  placed 
her  head  at  the  feet  of  Anasuya  and  departed. 

Shri  Ramachandra,  that  most  eloquent  one,  seeing  Sita 
adorned  with  the  ornaments  given  to  her  by  Anasuya,  was  filled 
with  joy.  Shri  Sita  then  told  him  of  the  liberality  of  the  aged 
ascetic,  and  showed  him  all  her  gifts.  Rare  indeed  were  those 
gifts  and  Shri  Rama  and  the  great  warrior  Shri  Lakshmana, 
rejoiced  over  the  bounty  of  Anasuya. 

The  night  passed  and  day  dawned,  the  two  princes  bathed, 
performed  their  morning  devotions  and  then  approached  the 
ascetics  for  food. 

The  pious  hermits  then  addressed  Shri  Rama  and  said  :  "  O 
Prince,  it  is  dangerous  to  wander  in  the  forest  on  account  of 
the  presence  of  asuras.  O  Prince,  wandering  about  in  various 
guises,  these  beings  feed  on  human  flesh  and  drink  the  blood 
of  men.  These  creatures  like  wild  beasts  kill  and  devour  any 
ascetic  who  is  negligent  or  impure.  O  Prince,  for  our  sake, 
do  thou  destroy  them.  This  path,  O  Prince,  is  the  way  by 
which  the  sages  go  to  gather  fruit,  let  it  be  thy  path  also." 

Then  the  holy  men  humbly  blessed  Shri  Rama  and  he,  the 
harasser  of  his  foes,  entered  the  forest  as  the  sun  enters  a  dark 
cloud.

Hari  Prasad  Shastri  began  the  translation  of  the  Ramayana 
of  Rishi  Valmiki  about  1945,  and  he  completed  the  work  in 
1948.  The  task  of  editing  the  translation,  proof  reading  and 
compiling  the  Glossaries  has  been  entrusted  to  some  of  his 
students,  and  the  first  of  the  three  volumes  was  published  in 
1952  and  was  favourably  received  by  the  critics.  A  generous 
recognition  on  the  part  of  the  Government  of  India  brought 
a  grant  towards  the  publication  cost  of  the  second  and  third 
volumes  which  is  hereby  gratefully  acknowledged. 

The  second  volume  of  the  Ramayana  closely  follows  the 
pattern  of  Volume  1  except  that  it  has  been  decided  to  dispense 
with  footnotes  so  far  as  possible,  and  to  expand  the  Glossaries. 
The  English  equivalent  of  all  Sanscrit  words  will  be  found  in 
these,  although  the  names  of  some  trees  have  not  been  traced. 

The  preparation  of  the  manuscript  of  the  third  and  last 
volume  is  well  advanced  and  publication  is  planned  for  next 
year.

BOOK  III 
A R ANY A   K.ANDA 


CHAPTER     I 

Rama  is  welcomed  by  the  Sages  of  the  Dandaka  Forest 

Entering  the  vast  Dandaka  Forest,  the  invincible  Rama, 
master  of  his  senses,  saw  a  circle  of  huts  belonging  to  the 
ascetics,  strewn  with  bark  and  kusha  grass,  blazing  with  spiritual 
effulgence  scarce  to  be  borne  by  mortal  eye,  as  the  noonday 
sun  is  a  source  of  torment  to  men. 

This  retreat,  a  haven  to  all  beings,  the  ground  of  which  was 
carefully  tended,  was  frequented  by  many  deer  and  multitudes 
of  birds  and  rendered  gay  by  the  dancing  of  troops  of  apsaras. 

Beautiful  with  its  spacious  huts,  where  the  sacred  fire  burnt, 
surrounded  by  ladles  and  other  articles  of  worship  such  as 
skins,  kusha  grass,  fuel,  jars  of  water,  fruit  and  roots  ;  encircled 
by  great  and  sacred  forest  trees,  bowed  with  the  weight  of 
ripe  and  delectable  fruits,  the  whole  hermitage  was  hallowed 
by  sacrificial  offerings  and  libations  and  re-echoed  to  the 
recitation  of  Vedic  hymns. 

Carpeted  with  flowers  of  every  kind,  possessing  pools 
covered  with  lotuses,  it  had  been  the  retreat  of  former  hermits, 
who  subsisted  on  fruit  and  roots  and  who,  wearing  robes  of 
bark  and  black  antelope  skins,  their  senses  fully  controlled, 
resembled  the  sun  or  fire.  Now  great  and  pious  sages,  practising 
every  austerity,  added  to  its  lustre.  Resembling  the  abode  of 
Brahma,  that  hermitage  resounded  with  the  chanting  of  Vedic 
hymns,  and  brahmins,  versed  in  the  Veda,  adorned  it  with 
their  presence. 

Beholding  that  sacred  place,  the  illustrious  Raghava,  un- 
stringing his  bow,  entered,  and  the  august  sages,  possessed  of 
spiritual  knowledge,  highly  gratified,  advanced  to  meet  him. 

Seeing  that  virtuous  one,  resembling  the  rising  moon,  with 
Lakshmana  and  Vaidehi  of  dazzling  beauty,  those  ascetics  of 
rigid  vows  received  them  with  words  of  welcome  and  the 
3  b 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

dwellers  in  the  wood  were  astonished  at  Rama's  handsome 
mien,  his  youthful  appearance,  majesty  and  graceful  attire  and, 
struck  with  wonder,  gazed  unwinkingly  on  Raghava,  Lakshmana 
and  Vaidehi,  as  on  a  great  marvel. 

Then,  those  blessed  sages,  engaged  in  the  welfare  of  all 
beings,  conducted  Rama  to  a  leaf-thatched  hut,  where,  offering 
him  the  traditional  hospitality,  those  fortunate  and  pious  men, 
resembling  fire  itself,  brought  water  that  he  might  wash  his 
hands  and  feet.  Experiencing  great  delight,  those  high-souled 
ascetics,  bidding  him  welcome,  gathered  flowers,  fruit  and 
roots,  placing  the  whole  content  of  the  hermitage  at  the  disposal 
of  that  magnanimous  hero. 

Thereafter,  those  ascetics,  versed  in  the  sacred  lore,  with 
joined  palms  addressed  him,  saying: — 

"  O  Raghava,  a  king  is  the  defender  of  the  rights  of  his 
people  and  their  refuge;  he  is  worthy  of  all  honour  and  respect, 
he  wields  the  sceptre,  he  is  the  Guru  and  partakes  of  a  fourth 
part  of  the  glory  of  Indra ;  he  enjoys  the  highest  prerogatives 
and  receives  every  homage.  We,  being  under  thy  dominion, 
should  be  protected  by  thee,  whether  living  in  the  capital  or 
the  forest ;  thou  art  our  Sovereign,  O  Master  of  the  World ! 

"  Having  renounced  all  desire  for  revenge,  subdued  anger  and 
mastered  our  senses,  do  thou  protect  us  in  the  practice  of 
virtue,  as  a  mother  protects  the  infant  at  her  breast." 

With  these  words  they  paid  reverence  to  Rama,  who  was 
accompanied  by  Lakshmana,  offering  him  fruit,  roots,  flowers 
and  every  product  of  field  and  forest,  whilst  other  ascetics, 
resembling  the  fire  in  lustre,  observers  of  sacred  vows,  honoured 
the  Lord  according  to  tradition. 


CHAPTER    2 

The  Demon  Viradha  carries  off  Sita 

Having  received  the  homage  of  the  ascetics,  at  dawn  Rama 
paid  obeisance  to  them  and  followed  by  Lakshmana,  entered 
the  forest,  which  abounded  in  every  kind  of  deer  and  was 
frequented  by  bears  and  tigers. 
4 


ARANYA    KANDA 

There,  trees,  creepers  and  shrubs  had  been  trampled  under- 
foot, so  that  the  paths  were  barely  distinguishable  and  the 
reflection  from  the  pools  and  lakes  was  dazzling ;  no  birds 
sang  in  that  whole  demesne,  which  was  filled  with  the  humming 
of  crickets.1 

Followed  by  Lakshmana,  Rama  searched  the  depths  of  the 
forest  with  his  gaze  and  in  that  wood,  abounding  in  ferocious 
beasts,  Kakutstha,  accompanied  by  Sita,  beheld  a  titan  as 
large  as  a  mountain  creating  a  great  uproar. 

Of  formidable  aspect,  hideous,  deformed,  his  eyes  sunk  deep 
in  his  forehead,  with  a  vast  mouth  and  protruding  belly,  clad 
in  a  tiger  skin,  covered  with  blood  and  loathsome  to  look  upon, 
he  struck  terror  into  the  hearts  of  all  beings ;  it  appeared  as 
if  death  itself  were  approaching  with  open  jaws. 

Three  lions,  four  tigers,  two  leopards,  four  dappled  deer 
and  the  head  of  a  great  elephant  with  its  tusks,  from  which 
the  fat  ran  down,  hung  from  his  spear. 

Seeing  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sita,  the  Princess  of  Mithila, 
he  rushed  upon  them  in  fury,  like  Time8  at  the  destruction  of 
the  worlds.  Then,  creating  a  great  uproar,  causing  the  earth 
to  tremble,  he  seized  Vaidehi  in  his  arms  and  began  to  carry 
her  away,  saying : — 

"  O  Ye,  wearing  matted  locks,  clad  in  robes  of  bark,  accom- 
panied by  a  common  consort,  ye  are  about  to  die !  Entering 
the  Dandaka  Forest,  armed  with  weapons,  bows  and  spears, 
whence  have  ye  come,  O  Ascetics  and  why  do  ye  dwell  here 
in  the  company  of  a  woman  ?  Perverse  and  evil  wretches,  who 
are  ye,  bringing  disrepute  on  the  sages  ? 

I  am  the  Titan  Viradha,  this  is  my  retreat  and  I  roam  the 
impenetrable  forest,  armed  with  weapons,  feeding  on  the  flesh 
of  ascetics.  This  woman  of  lovely  limbs  shall  become  my 
wife  and,  in  combat,  I  will  drink  the  blood  of  ye  both,  O 
Miscreants  1 " 

The  daughter  of  Janaka,  Sita,  hearing  the  cruel  and  arrogant 
speech  of  the  wicked-hearted  Viradha,  rilled  with  dread,  began 
to  tremble  like  a  palm  shaken  by  the  wind. 

1  The  Commentaor  explains  that  all  this  destruction  was  due  to  the  presence 
of  the  demon  Viradha  and  that  the  birds  had  deserted  the  place  in  fear  of  him. 

*  Time  in  the  form  of  Death,  the  Destroyer.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Rama,  seeing  Viradha  bearing  the  lovely  Sita  away,  growing 
pale,  said  to  Lakshmana : — 

"  O  Friend,  behold  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  my  chaste 
consort,  an  illustrious  princess,  reared  in  luxury,  held  fast  in 
the  arms  of  Viradha !  Alas  !  Kaikeyi's  desire  has  been  fulfilled 
to-day  !  O  Lakshmana,  the  enthronement  of  her  son  did  not 
suffice  that  designing  woman,  since  she  caused  me  to  be  banished 
to  the  forest  despite  the  love  my  subjects  bore  me.  Now  she 
who  reigns  supreme  in  the  midst  of  our  mothers  will  be  satisfied! 
That  another  should  have  laid  hands  on  Vaidehi  is  the  greatest 
of  my  misfortunes,  worse  even  than  the  death  of  my  sire  or 
the  loss  of  my  kingdom,  O  Saumitri !  " 

Hearing  the  words  of  Kakutstha,  Lakshmana,  his  eyes 
streaming  with  tears,  hissing  like  a  wounded  snake,  said 
harshly : — 

"  O  Kakutstha,  O  Protector  of  All  Beings,  who  art  equal 
to  Indra  himself,  since  I  am  thy  servant,  why  dost  thou  lament 
as  though  thou  hadst  no  defender  ? 

"  Pierced  by  the  shaft  I  am  about  to  loose  in  my  wrath,  the 
Titan  Viradha  will  die  and  the  earth  drink  his  blood.  The 
bitterness,  I  felt  towards  Bharata  for  his  desiring  the  throne, 
X  shall  expend  on  Viradha,  as  the  God  who  bears  the  thunder- 
bolt discharges  it  at  a  mountain!  With  all  the  strength  of 
mine  arm,  letting  fly  this  sharp  arrow,  I  shall  pierce  his  breast! 
May  he  yield  up  his  life  and  fall  rolling  on  the  earth ! " 


chapter    3 

The  Struggle  between   Viradha  and  the  two  Brothers 

Thereafter  Viradha  spoke  again,  filling  the  forest  with  his 
voice : — 

"  Who  are  ye,  where  are  ye  going,  answer  me ! " 
Then    the    illustrious    Rama    answered    that    titan,    whose 
countenance  was  inflamed  with  anger,  saying : — 
"  Know  us  to  be  two  warriors  of  the  race  of  Ikshwaku, 
6 


ARANYA    KANDA 

fixed  in  our  vows,  wandering  in  the  forest ;  but  now  we  would 
know  who  thou  art,  roaming  here  and  there  in  the  thickets  ?  " 

Thereupon  Viradha  said  to  Rama,  whose  strength  was 
truth:— 

"  Hear  and  I  will  tell  thee,  O  Prince  of  the  House  of  Raghu  ! 
I  am  the  son  of  Java  and  my  mother  is  Satarhada.  I  am 
known  among  the  titans  throughout  the  world  as  Viradha. 
Having  gratified  Brahma  by  my  penances,  I  obtained  a  boon 
and  was  rendered  invulnerable  to  any  weapon  on  earth ;  it  is 
impossible  to  slay  me  by  the  use  of  arms  ! 

"  Forsaking  this  fair  one,  do  ye,  renouncing  all  hope,  without 
turning  back,  go  hence  without  delay  and  I  will  grant  you 
your  lives ! " 

Then  Rama,  his  eyes  red  with  anger,  answered  that  hideous 
demon,  the  wicked  Viradha,  saying : — 

"  Wretch  that  thou  art,  cursed  be  thine  evil  design ;  assuredly 
thou  art  courting  death,  verily  thou  shalt  find  it  in  combat ; 
stay  but  an  instant  and  thou  shalt  not  escape  alive  !  " 

Bending  his  bow  and  speedily  placing  two  sharp  arrows  on 
it,  Rama  struck  that  demon  with  his  pointed  shafts  and  there- 
after, stretching  the  cord  tight,  he  loosed  seven  swift  arrows, 
adorned  with  feathers  and  tipped  with  gold,  equal  in  night 
to  Suparna  and  Anila. 

Having  pierced  the  body  of  Viradha,  those  fiery  shafts, 
decorated  with  heron's  plumes,  fell  to  the  ground  hissing  and 
stained  with  blood. 

On  receiving  those  wounds,  Viradha  loosed  his  hold  on 
Vaidehi  and  brandishing  his  spear  in  fury  hurled  himself  on 
Rama  and  on  Lakshmana  who  accompanied  him.  Letting 
forth  a  mighty  roar,  grasping  his  spear,  like  unto  the 
standard  of  Indra,  his  jaws  wide  open,  he  resembled  death 
itself. 

Then  the  two  brothers  rained  a  volley  of  flaming  arrows  on 
Viradha,  who  resembled  time,  death  or  fate,  but  that  terrible 
demon,  bursting  into  loud  laughter,  halting  and  opening  his 
jaws,  threw  up  those  pointed  arrows  by  virtue  of  the  boon  he 
had  received.  Restraining  his  breath  and  brandishing  his 
spear,  the  demon  Viradha  again  rushed  on  the  two  descendants 
of  Raghu,  whereupon  Rama,  the  most  skilful  of  warriors,  with 
7 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

two  arrows  cut  off  that  spear,  which  shone  like  lightning  and 
resembled  a  flame  in  the  sky. 

Shattered  by  Rama's  shafts,  the  spear  fell  to  the  ground, 
like  a  rocky  ledge  split  by  lightning.  Thereat,  unbuckling 
their  swords,  those  warriors  swiftly  fell  on  Viradha  like  two 
black  serpents,  striking  him  heavily  again  and  again. 

Though  hard  beset,  their  formidable  opponent  beat  them 
off  vigorously  with  his  fists,  but  they  stood  firm,  whereupon 
he  sought  to  lift  them  from  the  ground  and  Rama,  guessing 
his  intention,  said  to  Lakshmana : — 

"  Let  the  demon  carry  us  along  the  path  as  far  as  he  wishes, 
O  Saumitri !  Allow  this  Prowler  of  the  Night  to  bear  us 
according  to  his  whim,  since  he  is  proceeding  along  our  way." 

Thereupon,  the  demon,  proud  of  his  strength,  with  great 
energy  lifted  them  up  and  placed  them  on  his  shoulders  like 
two  striplings ;  then  having  set  the  two  descendants  of  Raghu 
on  his  shoulders,  the  demon  Viradha,  Ranger  of  the  Night, 
emitting  a  great  roar,  strode  off  into  the  forest. 

Entering  that  forest,  abounding  in  trees  of  every  kind,  where 
diverse  birds  filled  the  air  with  their  song  and  which  was 
thronged  with  jackals,  beasts  and  serpents,  he  resembled  a 
great  cloud. 


CHAPTER     4 

Rama  and  Lakshmana  slay  the  Demon  Viradha 

Seeing  the  two  brothers,  the  glory  of  the  House  of  Raghu, 
being  borne  away,  Sita,  lifting  up  her  arms,  began  to  cry  aloud, 
reflecting  thus : — 

*  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  who  is  truthful,  virtuous  and 
guileless,  is  being  carried  away  by  a  demon  of  terrifying  aspect; 
I  shall  become  a  prey  to  bears,  tigers  and  panthers  ! ' 

Thinking  thus,  she  cried  out : — "  O  Foremost  of  Demons, 
I  beg  of  thee,  take  me  and  spare  those  two  descendants  of 
Raghu ! " 

Hearing  Vaidehi's  words,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  full  of 
valour,  prepared  to  slay  that  wicked  wretch,  whereupon 
8 


ARANYA    KANDA 

Saumitri  broke  the  left  arm  of  that  redoubtable  demon  and 
Rama  the  right;  thereafter,  that  titan,  resembling  a  mass  of 
cloud,  his  arms  broken,  growing  weak,  suddenly  fell  to  the 
ground  unconscious,  like  a  mountain  struck  by  lightning. 

Then  the  two  brothers  beat  the  demon  with  their  fists  and 
feet  and  picking  him  up,  again  hurled  him  to  the  ground; 
yet,  though  struck  by  innumerable  arrows  and  wounded  by 
their  swords,  the  demon  did  not  die. 

Perceiving  it  to  be  impossible  to  slay  that  giant,  like  unto 
a  mountain,  the  blessed  Rama,  the  refuge  of  all  who  are  in 
peril,  spoke  thus  : — 

"  By  virtue  of  his  penances,  O  Tiger  among  Men,  this 
demon  cannot  be  overcome  in  combat  by  weapons,  let  us 
therefore  cast  him  into  a  pit.  O  Lakshmana,  as  if  for  a  great 
elephant,  do  thou  dig  a  pit  in  the  forest  for  this  demon  of 
formidable  size.*' 

Having  thus  commanded  Lakshmana  saying  : — "  Dig  a  pit ", 
the  valiant  Rama  stood  with  his  foot  on  the  neck  of  the  demon. 

Hearing  those  words,  the  demon  in  humble  accents  addressed 
that  descendant  of  Raghu,  that  Bull  among  Men,  saying : — 

"  O  Lion  among  Heroes,  under  the  blows  of  a  warrior 
whose  strength  equals  that  of  Indra,  I  am  dying.  In  mine 
ignorance,  I  did  not  recognize  thee,  O  Lion  amongst  Men ! 
I  see  now  that  thou  an  the  noble  son  of  Kaushalya.  O  Dear 
Child,  thou  art  Rama  and  this  is  the  fortunate  Vaidehi  and  the 
illustrious  Lakshmana. 

"  Through  a  curse,  I  had  to  assume  the  monstrous  shape  of 
a  titan,  but  in  reality  I  am  the  Gandharva  Tumburu,  who 
incurred  the  wrath  of  Kuvera.  That  glorious  God,  being 
propitiated  by  me,  said  : — '  When  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha, 
overcomes  thee  in  fight,  then,  assuming  thy  natural  form,  thou 
shalt  return  to  the  celestial  region.'  Owing  to  my  lack  of 
reverence  for  him,  in  anger  the  Lord  Kuvera  had  denounced  me 
for  having  conceived  an  attachment  for  the  nymph,  Rambha. 
By  thy  grace,  I  am  delivered  from  this  terrible  curse  and  shall 
now  return  to  mine  abode.  All  hail  to  thee,  O  Scourger  of 
thy  Foes! 

"  O  Dear  Child,  not  far  from  here,  at  approximately  four  and 
half  miles  distance,  dwells  the  virtuous  Sharabhanga,  a  mine 
9 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  austerity,  a  great  and  mighty  rishi,  effulgent  as  the  sun. 
Go  there,  without  delay;  he  will  give  thee  most  excellent 
counsel! 

Having  buried  me  in  a  pit,  O  Rama,  go  thy  way  in  peace ! 
Those  demons  who  are  about  to  die  must  according  to  a  fixed 
law  be  buried  in  a  pit." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Kakutstha,  the  courageous  Viradha, 
pierced  by  many  arrows,  leaving  bis  body,  ascended  to  heaven.1 

Then  Raghava  said  to  Lakshmana : — "  Dig  a  pit  for  this 
demon  of  dreadful  deeds,  as  for  a  great  elephant  in  the  forest." 
Having  spoken  thus  to  Lakshmana  saying  *  Dig  a  pit ! ',  Rama 
who  was  endowed  with  great  prowess,  remained  standing  with 
his  foot  on  the  head  of  Viradha. 

Then  Lakshmana,  taking  up  a  pick,  dug  a  great  pit  by  the 
side  of  the  demon,  whose  ears  resembled  conches  and  threw 
him  into  it,  he  letting  forth  dreadful  shrieks  the  while. 

Finding  they  were  unable  to  kill  that  great  titan  with  their 
sharp  weapons,  those  two  lions  among  men,  having  employed 
all  their  ingenuity,  put  an  end  to  Viradha  by  burying  him  in 
the  pit. 

Viradha  himself,  a  ranger  of  the  forest,  desiring  to  die  at 
Rama's  hands,  had  indicated  to  him  how  he  should  proceed, 
saying : — "  I  cannot  be  slain  by  weapons." 

Hearing  this,  the  idea  had  come  to  Rama  to  fling  him  into 
a  pit,  and  while  being  cast  into  it,  that  all-powerful  demon 
caused  the  forest  to  resound  with  his  cries. 

Having  thrown  Viradha  into  the  pit,  Rama  and  Lakshmana, 
their  fears  removed,  rejoiced  in  that  forest,  like  the  sun  and 
moon  in  the  firmament. 


CHAPTER     5 

The  Meeting  with  the  Sage  Sharabhanga  and  his  Ascent 
to  Brahmaloka 

Having  slain  the  mighty  and  terrible  Viradha  in  the  forest, 
the  valiant  Rama  embraced  Sita  and  comforted  her;  then 
addressing  the  resplendent  Lakshmana,  he  said : — 

1  The  following  passages  clearly  indicate  the  resumption  of  the  narrative  on 
a  later  occasion. 


ARANYA    KANDA 

"  This  impenetrable  forest  is  dangerous  and  we  are  not  its 
natural  inhabitants;  let  us  therefore  seek  out  the  Sage  Shara- 
bhanga  without  delay." 

Raghava  then  turned  his  steps  towards  Sharabhanga's 
hermitage  and,  approaching  that  Sage,  whose  soul  was  purified 
by  renunciation,  he  observed  a  great  marvel. 

In  the  sky,  he  beheld  India,  gorgeously  attired  in  robes  free 
from  any  particle  of  dust,  his  body  shining  like  the  sun  or  fire, 
mounted  on  a  splendid  chariot,  followed  by  all  the  Celestials 
and  innumerable  high-souled  sages  like  unto  himself,  who 
served  as  his  escort.  Bay  horses  were  yoked  to  that  aerial  car, 
that  shone  like  the  rising  sun  and,  luminous  as  the  moon's  disc, 
resembled  a  mass  of  white  clouds. 

Rama  also  observed  an  immaculate  canopy  with  magnificent 
garlands  and  marvellous  fans  made  of  yaks'  tails  with  handles 
of  gold  of  great  price,  which  two  women  of  rare  beauty,  waved 
to  and  fro  over  the  head  of  that  God,  whilst  Gandharvas, 
Immortals,  Celestial  Beings  and  great  Rishis,  paid  homage  to 
him  with  sublime  chants,  as  he  hovered  in  space. 

Seeing  Shatakratu  conversing  with  the  Sage  Sharabhanga, 
Rama  pointed  out  the  chariot  to  his  brother  and  bade  him 
gaze  on  the  marvellous  sight. 

He  said : — "  O  Lakshmana,  dost  thou  behold  that  dazzling 
car  of  great  brilliance  shining  like  the  sun  in  the  skies  ?  With- 
out doubt,  these  are  the  celestial  bay  horses  of  Indra  of  whom 
we  have  heard,  who  travels  through  space  and  who  is  constantly 
invoked  at  the  time  of  sacrifice.  Those  youthful  warriors 
wearing  earrings,  who  in  groups  of  hundreds,  with  swords  in 
their  hands,  stand  round  him  in  the  sky,  with  their  broad 
chests  and  strong  arms  resembling  maces,  clad  in  magnificent 
purple,  look  like  fierce  tigers.  On  their  breasts,  gleam  rows 
of  pearls,  and  those  lions  among  men,  of  handsome  mien, 
appear  to  be  twenty-five  years  old  which  is  the  age  at  which 
the  Gods  ever  remain,  O  Saumitri.  Tarry  here  a  moment, 
O  Lakshmana,  so  that  I  may  discover  who  this  great  hero  in 
the  chariot  really  is." 

Having  uttered  the  words  '  Tarry  here '  to  Saumitri, 
Kakutstha     advanced    towards    the    hermitage   of   Sharab- 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Seeing  Rama  approaching,  the  Lord  of  Sachi,  taking  leave 
of  the  sage,  said  to  the  Gods : — 

"  Rama  is  coming  hither,  take  me  to  mine  abode  *ere  he 
addresses  me ;  later  he  shall  behold  me  !  When  he  returns 
victorious,  having  fulfilled  his  purpose,  I  shall  readily  show 
myself  to  him.  It  is  for  him  to  perform  a  great  exploit 
impossible  for  any  other  to  accomplish." 

Thereafter,  offering  salutations  to  the  ascetic,  in  all  humility, 
the  God  who  bears  the  thunderbolt,  the  Scourge  of  his  Foes, 
ascended  to  heaven  in  his  chariot,  harnessed  with  horses. 

When  the  God  of  a  Thousand  Eyes  had  departed,  Raghava 
rejoined  his  consort  and  his  brother  and  together  they 
approached  Sharabhanga,  who  was  seated  before  the  sacred 
fire.  Embracing  his  feet,  Rama,  Sita  and  Lakshmana,  on  his 
invitation,  seated  themselves  in  the  place  assigned  to  them. 

Questioned  by  Raghava  concerning  Indra's  visit,  Shara- 
bhanga related  everything  to  him. 

He  said : — 

"  O  Rama,  that  magnanimous  God  wished  to  conduct  me 
to  Brahmaloka,  the  region  I  have  attained  by  the  merit  of  my 
penances,  which  is  inaccessible  to  those  who  are  not  masters 
of  themselves. 

"  Seeing  thee  approaching,  know  well,  O  Foremost  of  Men, 
that  I  had  no  desire  to  enter  Brahmaloka  *ere  I  had  enjoyed 
thy  gende  presence  in  my  hermitage.  O  Lion  among  Men, 
O  Virtuous  and  Magnanimous  Prince,  having  had  intercourse 
with  thee,  I  shall  ascend  first  to  the  three  lower  heavens  and 
thereafter  to  the  highest.  These  worlds  of  unsurpassed 
beauty  that  have  been  conquered  by  me,  these  sublime  abodes 
of  Brahma,  that  are  mine  by  right,  do  thou  accept,  O  Lion 
among  Men !  " 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  Rishi  Sharabhanga,  Raghava,  that 
lion  among  men,  versed  in  the  Shastras,  answered  : — 

"  I  also  have  conquered  all  the  worlds,  O  Great  Ascetic, 
but  in  obedience  to  my  vow  I  desire  to  remain  in  the  forest." 

Thus  addressed  by  Raghava,  whose  might  was  equal  to 
Indra's,  the  eminently  sagacious  Sharabhanga  spoke  again, 
saying: — 

"  O  Rama,  the  illustrious  and  virtuous  Sutikshna  lives  in 


ARANYA    KANDA 

this  forest;  that  saint  will  tell  thee  what  is  best  for  thee  to  do. 
"Follow  the  river  Mandakini,  that  stream  which  is  covered 
with  a  carpet  of  flowers,  and  thou  wilt  reach  his  dwelling  place. 
There  is  the  path,  O  Tiger  among  Men,  but  stay  with  me  a 
moment  yet,  till  I  abandon  this  body  as  a  snake  casts  off  its 


Thereafter,  having  prepared  a  fire  and  poured  clarified 
butter  therein,  Sharabhanga,  that  sage  of  supreme  merit, 
entered  the  flames  to  the  accompaniment  of  sacred  formulas. 

The  hair  of  the  magnanimous  one  was  consumed  together 
with  his  wrinkled  skin,  his  bones,  his  flesh  and  his  blood, 
whereupon,  assuming  a  youthful  and  splendid  appearance, 
Sharabhanga  rose  from  the  pyre  like  a  flame. 

Traversing  the  region  where  the  sacrificial  fires  are  tended 
by  high-souled  sages,  as  well  as  that  of  the  Gods,  he  ascended 
to  Brahma's  abode. 

That  foremost  of  Rishis,  of  purified  karma,  there  beheld  the 
Grandsire  of  the  World  with  those  attendant  on  him,  who, 
seeing  that  sage,  addressed  him,  saying : — "  Thou  art 
welcome ! " 


CHAPTER    6 

The  Sages  seek  the  protection  of  Rama 

Sharabhanga  having  ascended  to  heaven,  the  assembled 
ascetics  presented  themselves  before  Rama,  the  offspring  of 
Kakutstha  of  flaming  energy,  and  among  them  were  those 
who  had  sprung  from  the  nails  and  the  hair  of  Brahma's  body, 
also  from  the  water  in  which  his  feet  were  bathed ;  there  were 
those  who  lived  on  the  moon's  rays ;  those  who  subsisted  on 
milled  grain;  those  who  did  penance  by  standing  in  water; 
those  who  slept  on  the  naked  ground ;  those  who  lived  in  the 
open  air  the  whole  year  round ;  those  who  subsisted  on  water 
and  wind  alone ;  those  who  never  sought  the  shade ;    those 

1  Five  Fires. — Four  fires  and  the  sun  overhead.    See  Glossary  also  under 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

who  underwent  long  fasts ;  those  who  practised  uninterrupted 
repetition  of  prayer  j  those  who  gave  themselves  up  to  perpetual 
penance  J  those  who  dwelt  on  the  summit  of  high  mountains ; 
those  who  had  subdued  their  senses  and  those  who  lived 
between  five  fires.1 

All  these  sages,  fixed  in  Yoga,  endowed  with  the  powers  of 
Brahma,  gathered  in  Sharabhanga's  hermitage  in  order  to 
approach  Rama. 

Those  virtuous  companies  of  Rishis,  having  assembled  there, 
addressed  Rama,  Foremost  of  the  Good,  who  was  conversant 
with  his  supreme  duty,  saying : — 

"  O  Lord  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku  and  of  the  whole  world, 
Warrior  of  the  Great  Car,  thou  art  our  defender  and  leader, 
as  Maghavan  is  of  the  Gods. 

*'  Thou  art  famed  in  the  Three  Worlds  for  thy  valour  and 
glory !  Filial  devotion,  justice  and  faith  find  their  consum- 
mation in  thee,  O  Lord.  It  behoves  thee,  who  art  cognisant 
with  virtue,  to  pardon  our  temerity  in  approaching  thee  in 
order  to  make  our  supplication. 

"  It  were  a  signal  defect  for  a  king  to  receive  one-sixth  of  the 
revenue  of  his  people,  if  he  did  not  protect  them  as  his  own 
sons.  Should  he  however  defend  those  who  inhabit  his 
kingdom  as  his  own  life  or  as  the  lives  of  his  offspring,  to 
whom  he  is  ever  devoted,  he  will  occupy  an  exalted  position 
in  the  region  of  Brahma. 

"  The  supreme  blessedness  acquired  by  those  ascetics  who 
live  on  roots  and  fruit  is  not  equal  to  a  quarter  of  that  attained 
by  the  monarch  who  governs  his  subjects  according  to  the  law. 

"  Do  thou  become  the  defender  of  those  countless  brahmins 
who  live  in  the  forest  who  are  without  a  protector,  and  so 
defend  them  from  the  cruel  persecution  of  the  titans. 

"  Come  and  behold  the  bodies  of  innumerable  ascetics  of 
pure  heart,  who  have  been  slaughtered  in  diverse  ways  in  the 
forest  by  titans. 

"  They  have  inflicted  great  carnage  amongst  the  people  who 
dwell  on  Lake  Fampa,  by  the  river  Mandakini  and  on  Chittrakuta. 
We  are  no  longer  able  to  endure  the  terrible  plight  of  these 
sages,  brought  about  in  the  forest  by  those  titans  of  cruel 
deeds ;  therefore  we  take  refuge  in  thee ;  protect  us,  O  Rama, 
14 


ARANYA    KANDA 

against  those  Prowlers  of  the  Night,  who  seek  our  destruction. 
We  have  no  asylum  on  earth  but  thee,  O  Valiant  Prince ; 
do  thou  save  us  from  the  titans." 

Having  listened  to  the  sages,  the  virtuous  Kakutstha  answered 
them,  who  were  rich  in  heavy  penances,  saying : — 

"  Do  not  entreat  me  thus ;  am  I  not  the  servant  of  the  sages  ? 
It  is  solely  to  fulfil  my  duty,  that  I  have  entered  the  forest. 
It  is  in  order  to  deliver  you  from  the  oppression  of  the  titans 
and  to  carry  out  the  commands  of  my  sire  that  I  am  here. 
It  is  in  your  interest  and  for  your  happiness  that  I  have  come 
here  of  mine  own  will. 

"  My  sojourn  in  the  forest  will  be  greatly  to  your  advantage ; 
I  shall  slay  the  titans,  the  enemies  of  the  ascetics.  Let  the 
sages  witness  my  prowess  in  combat  and  my  brother's  also, 
O  Rishis !  " 

Having  yielded  to  the  entreaty  of  the  ascetics,  that  hero, 
firm  in  his  duty,  accompanied  by  Lakshmana,  directed  his 
course  towards  the  hermitage  of  Sutikshna,  followed  by  the 
sages,  who  paid  him  every  honour. 


CHAPTER    7 

The  Meeting  between  Rama  and  Sutikshna 

Rama,  the  Scourge  of  his  Foes,  accompanied  by  his  brother, 
Sita  and  the  sages,  approached  the  hermitage  of  Sutikshna,  and 
having  proceeded  far  and  crossed  many  deep  rivers  he  beheld  a 
wonderful  mountain  as  high  as  Mount  Meru. 

Thereafter  those  two  scions  of  the  House  of  Raghu  went 
forward  with  Sita  through  a  forest  filled  with  many  kinds  of 
trees  and  having  penetrated  into  that  dense  woodland,  abound- 
ing in  trees  laden  with  flowers  and  fruit,  Rama  observed  in  a 
solitary  spot  a  hermitage  decorated  with  garlands  and  bark, 

There  he  beheld  the  Sage  Sutikshna,  a  mine  of  asceticism, 
his  hair  matted,  covered  with  dust,  seated  in  the  lotus  posture 
and  addressed  him,  saying : — 

"  O  Blessed  One,  I  am  Rama,  who  have  come  hither  to 
15 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

behold  thee.  Be  gracious  enough,  O  Virtuous  and  Illustrious 
Rishi,  O  Essence  of  Sanctity,  to  speak  to  me." 

Seeing  Ramachandra,  the  sage,  foremost  of  the  ascetics, 
took  him  in  his  arms  and  addressed  him  thus : — 

"  Be  thou  welcome,  O  Best  of  the  Raghus,  O  Rama,  chief  of 
virtuous  men.  Henceforth  this  hermitage,  which  thou  hast 
entered,  has  a  protector.  I  have  waited  for  thee,  O  Illustrious 
Hero,  and  for  this  reason  did  not  ascend  to  the  region  of  the 
Gods,  leaving  my  body  here  on  earth.  I  had  heard  that  thou, 
being  banished  from  thy  kingdom,  had  gone  to  Chittrakuta, 
O  Kakutstha ! 

"  The  Chief  of  the  Gods,  Shatakratu,  came  hither  and 
approaching  me,  that  mighty  King  of  the  Celestials  made  it 
known  to  me  that  I  had  conquered  all  the  worlds  by  virtue  of 
my  good  karma. 

"  All  those  blessings  acquired  by  the  divine  sages  through 
asceticism  I  offer  to  thee ;  do  thou  enjoy  them  with  thy  con- 
sort and  Lakshmana." 

To  that  great  and  illustrious  sage  of  rigid  vows  and  devout 
speech,  Rama,  the  master  of  his  senses,  replied,  as  Vasava 
addresses  Brahma,  saying  : — 

"  O  Illustrious  Sage,  I  myself  have  conquered  the  worlds ; 
yet  in  accordance  with  the  command  received  by  me,  I  have 
elected  to  dwell  in  the  great  forest.  '  Thou  art  possessed  of  every- 
thing, yet  art  engaged  in  the  welfare  of  all  beings  ',  were  the 
words  of  the  ascetic  Sharabhanga,  that  Gautama  of  great  soul, 
to  me." 

Hearing  Rama's  words,  the  great  Rishi,  renowned  throughout 
the  world,  graciously  addressed  him,  saying  : — 

"  Do  thou  live  in  this  hermitage,  O  Rama,  which  is  pleasant 
and  frequented  by  companies  of  sages,  where  one  may  gather 
roots  and  fruit  in  all  seasons,  where  herds  of  marvellous  deer 
gather  without  injuring  any  and  come  and  go  enchanting  all 
with  their  beauty.  No  harm  is  to  be  encountered  here,  save 
what  the  deer  bring  about." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  great  Rishi,  the  elder  brother  of 
Lakshmana,  lifting  up  his  bow  and  arrows,  said  : — 

"  O  Blessed  Lord,  what  could  be  more  unfortunate  than

ARANYA    KANDA 

those  deer  that  gather  here,  and  thus  give  thee  pain;  for  this 
reason  I  shall  not  sojourn  long  in  this  sanctuary." 

Having  spoken  thus,  Rama  became  silent  and  performed  his 
evening  devotions ;  thereafter  with  Sita  and  Lakshmana  he 
prepared  to  pass  the  night  in  Sutikshna's  enchanting  hermitage. 

The  evening  having  passed  and  night  fallen,  the  magnani- 
mous Sutikshna  with  his  own  hands  distributed  hulled  grain, 
the  traditional  food  of  the  ascetics,  to  those  Lions  among  Men, 
having  paid  homage  to  them. 


CHAPTER     8 

Rama  takes  leave  of  Sutikshna 

Rama,  having  been  treated  with  all  honour  by  Sutikshna, 
passed  the  night  in  the  ashrama  with  Saumitri,  and  waking  at 
dawn  bathed  with  Sita  in  the  cool  waters  fragrant  with  the  scent 
of  lotuses. 

At  the  proper  time,  having  duly  worshipped  Agni  and  the 
Gods  in  that  forest  containing  the  retreats  of  the  ascetics, 
Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Videha's  daughter,  observing  the  sun 
had  risen,  approached  Sutikshna  with  courtesy,  saying : — 

"  O  Lord,  thou  hast  ministered  liberally  to  us  and  paid  us 
every  honour,  now  we  ask  leave  to  depart,  since  the  ascetics 
who  accompany  us  wish  us  to  press  on  without  delay. 

"  It  is  our  wish  to  visit  all  the  retreats  inhabited  by  holy 
men  of  devout  practices  in  the  Dandaka  Forest.  We  therefore 
beg  to  take  leave  of  these  great  sages,  fixed  in  their  vows, 
purified  by  penance  and  resembling  clear  flames. 

"  We  desire  to  go  hence  'ere  the  rays  of  the  sun  shine  too 
fiercely  and  become  unbearable,  like  one  who  has  usurped 
royal  prerogatives  by  unlawful  means  !  " 

Having  spoken  thus,  Raghava  with  Saumitri  and  Sita,  bowed 
down  to  the  feet  of  the  sage,  and  that  Foremost  of  Ascetics, 
raising  up  those  two  heroes,  clasped  them  affectionately  to  his 
heart  and  said  :— 

17 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Go  thy  way  safely,  O  Rama,  in  the  company  of  Saumitri 
and  Sita,  who  follows  thee  like  a  shadow.  Visit  the  entrancing 
solitudes  of  the  Dandaka  Forest,  where  those  hermits  dwell 
whose  souls  are  purified  by  renunciation.  Thou  shalt  see 
there  woods  abounding  in  fruit,  roots  and  flowers,  magnificent 
herds  of  deer,  flocks  of  tame  birds,  tufts  of  lotus  in  bloom, 
tranquil  lakes  abounding  in  waterfowl,  charming  mountain 
springs  and  splendid  cataracts  falling  from  the  hills  with 
marvellous  groves  echoing  to  the  peacock's  cry.  Go,  O  Child, 
and  thou  also,  Sumitra's  son ;  then  come  again  to  this  retreat 
when  thou  hast  seen  all." 

Thus  addressed,  Kakutstha  and  Lakshmana  answered: — 
"  Be  it  so ! "  and  circumambulating  the  sage,  prepared  to 
depart. 

Thereafter  the  large-eyed  Sita  handed  those  brothers  their 
excellent  quivers,  bows  and  shining  swords,  and  taking  leave 
of  the  great  sages  the  two  descendants  of  the  House  of  Raghu, 
of  unsurpassed  beauty,  fastening  on  their  quivers  and  bearing 
their  bows  and  swords,  swiftly  set  out  with  Sita. 


CHAPTER    9 

Sita  implores  Rama  not  to  attack  the  Titans 

When  her  lord,  the  Joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  having  obtained 
the  permission  of  Sutikshna  was  proceeding  on  his  way,  Sita,  in 
gracious  and  gentle  tones,  addressed  him  saying : — 

"  Though  thou  art  noble,  a  small  defect  by  imperceptible 
degrees  becomes  great,  but  it  is  always  possible  to  eschew 
evil,  born  of  desire.  There  are  three  failings,  born  of  desire; 
the  first  is  the  uttering  of  falsehood,  but  the  other  two  are  of 
graver  significance,  namely,  association  with  another's  wife  and 
acts  of  violence  committed  without  provocation. 

"  O  Raghava,  falsehood  was  never,  nor  could  ever  be,  thy 
weakness ;  nor  yet,  O  Indra  among  Men,  couldst  thou,  even 
in  thought,  covet  another's  wife ;  this  fault,  destructive  of 
18 


ARANYA    KANDA 

virtue,  was  never  thine,  O  Son  of  a  King !  Thou  hast  ever 
centred  thine  attention  on  thine  own  consort ! 

"  Thou  art  righteous,  humble  and  faithful  to  the  commands 
of  thy  sire ;  in  thee,  justice  and  integrity  flower  in  their  fullness. 
All  this  is  possible  to  those  who  have  mastered  their  senses, 
O  Long-armed  Warrior,  and  thou  art  fully  self-subdued,  O 
Thou  of  Charming  Presence ! 

"  The  third  evil,  which  through  ignorance  leads  men  to  bear 
hostility  to  one  another  without  cause,  now  shows  itself  in  thee  ! 
O  Valiant  Prince,  thou  hast  vowed  to  the  dwellers  of  the 
Dandaka  Forest,  whose  defender  thou  art,  to  slay  the  demons 
without  mercy,  and  for  this  reason,  equipped  with  bows  and 
arrows,  thou  hast  set  out  with  thy  brother  to  the  forest  known 
as  Dandaka.  Seeing  thee  advancing  thus  my  mind  is  rilled 
with  apprehension  and  I  am  pondering  how  to  act  in  the  most 
profitable  manner  for  thy  welfare  in  this  world  and  the  next. 
Thy  departure  for  the  Dandaka  Forest  does  not  find  favour 
with  me,  O  Hero ;  I  will  tell  thee  the  reason. 

"  Entering  the  forest  with  thy  brother,  armed  with  bows  and 
arrows,  it  may  well  be  that,  on  seeing  the  titans,  thou  wilt 
loose  thy  shafts !  As  the  proximity  of  faggots  increases  the 
violence  of  the  fire,  even  so  does  the  possession  of  a  bow 
increase  the  strength  and  energy  of  a  warrior ! 

"  In  former  times,  O  Long-armed  Prince,  in  a  sacred  forest 
frequented  by  deer  and  birds,  dwelt  a  devout  and  virtuous 
ascetic.  With  the  intention  of  obstructing  his  austerities, 
Indra,  the  Lord  of  Sachi,  in  the  guise  of  a  warrior,  went  to 
that  hermitage,  sword  in  hand.  In  this  retreat,  he  left  that 
excellent  sword,  requesting  the  sage,  engaged  in  pious  acts, 
to  guard  it  as  a  trust.  Receiving  that  weapon,  he,  fully  con- 
scious of  the  charge  laid  upon  him,  ranged  the  forest,  carefully 
watching  over  the  sword  entrusted  to  him.  Intent  on  preserving 
it,  he  ventured  nowhere  without  that  sword,  either  to  gather 
fruit  and  roots  or  for  other  reasons.  Constantly  bearing  this 
weapon  and  neglecting  his  penances,  by  degrees,  that  ascetic 
developed  warlike  inclinations.  In  time  that  foolish  hermit, 
carrying  the  sword,  began  to  enjoy  nothing  so  much  as  violence 
and,  losing  his  sobriety,  was  led  astray  and  fell  into  hell. 

"  This,  formerly,  was  the  result  of  bearing  arms  !  As  contact 
19  c 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKZ 

with  fire  works  change  in  a  piece  of  wood,  so  the  carrying  of 
arms  works  alteration  in  the  mind  of  him  who  carries  them. 

"  From  affection  and  reverence  for  thee,  I  draw  thine  atten- 
tion to  this  matter.  I  do  not  venture  to  instruct  thee. 
Equipped  with  bows  as  thou  art,  I  ask  thee  to  renounce  all 
thought  of  slaying  the  titans  in  the  Dandaka  Forest  without 
provocation.  O  Warrior!  the  world  looks  askance  on  those 
who  strike  without  cause.  It  is  the  duty  of  warriors  to  protect 
those  of  subdued  soul  who  are  in  peril.  The  bearing  of  arms 
and  retirement  to  the  forest,  practice  of  war  and  the  exercise 
of  asceticism  are  opposed  to  each  other;  let  us  therefore 
honour  the  moral  code  that  pertains  to  peace.  Murderous 
thoughts,  inspired  by  desire  for  gain,  are. born  of  the  handling 
of  weapons.  When  thou  dost  return  to  Ayodhya,  thou  wilt 
be  able  to  take  up  the  duties  of  a  warrior  once  more.  The 
joy  of  my  mother  and  father-in-law  will  be  complete,  if  during 
the  renunciation  of  thy  kingdom,  thou  dost  lead  the  life  of  an 
ascetic.  Thus  happiness  accrues  to  one  who  discharges  his 
duty ;  through  performance  of  one's  duty,  the  whole  world  is 
conquered,  duty  constituting  its  very  marrow.  It  is  by  the 
complete  negation  of  self  that  the  saints  acquired  bliss ;  happi- 
ness is  not  born  of  pleasure ! 

*'  O  My  Friend,  with  a  pure  heart  fulfil  thy  duty  in  solitude; 
thou  art  conversant  with  the  nature  of  the  Three  Worlds. 

"  It  is  through  feminine  weakness  that  I  speak  thus,  for 
who  would  dare  to  instruct  thee  in  thy  duty  ?  Having  reflected 
carefully  on  what  I  have  said,  do  what  thou  considerest  best 
without  further  delay !  " 


CHAPTER    10 

Rama  reminds  Sita  of  his  Promise  to  the  Ascetics 

Hearing  Vaidehi's  speech,  inspired  by  conjugal  tenderness, 
Rama,  his  energy  enhanced,  replied  to  the  daughter  of  Janaka, 
saying: — 

"  O  Noble  Lady,  it  is  in  appropriate  words,  dictated  by 
thine  affection,  that  thou  hast  sought  to  instruct  me  in  the 
duties  of  my  caste. 


ARANYA    KANDA 

"  How  shall  I  answer  thee,  O  Princess  ?  Thou  thyself  hast 
said :  '  Warriors  bear  their  bows,  so  that  the  word  "oppression" 
may  not  be  heard  on  earth.'  O  Sita,  it  is  on  account  of  those 
ascetics  of  severe  penances,  beset  with  perils  in  the  Dandaka 
Forest,  who  have  sought  my  protection,  that  I  have  come  hither. 
Dwelling  in  the  forest  at  all  times,  where  they  live  on  fruit 
and  roots,  they  are  unable  to  enjoy  a  peaceful  existence  on 
account  of  the  titans,  O  Timid  Lady,  These  hermits  of  the 
Dandaka  Forest  are  devoured  by  those  terrible  demons,  who 
live  on  human  flesh.  '  Come  to  our  aid  *  was  the  cry  of  those 
excellent  Twice-born,  and  when  I  heard  those  words  falling 
from  their  lips,  I  promised  to  obey  them  and  answered  '  Fear 
not ' !  It  was  a  source  of  the  greatest  distress  to  me  to  see 
them  kneeling  at  my  feet,  when  it  was  I  who  should  have 
been  touching  theirs." 

" '  What  do  you  desire  of  me  ? ' ,  I  enquired  of  that  assembly 
of  the  Twice-born,  whereupon,  drawing  near,  they  spoke  the 
following  words : — 

"  *  In  the  Dandaka  Forest,  innumerable  demons,  assuming 
different  forms,  torment  us  cruelly.  O  Rama,  do  thou  protect 
us !  The  time  of  the  Homa  sacrifice  and  the  days  of  the  full 
moon  have  come,  O  Irreproachable  Prince !  Thou  art  the 
sure  refuge  of  all  the  saints  and  ascetics  who  harassed  by  the 
titans  seek  thy  protection.  By  the  power  of  our  asceticism 
it  were  easy  for  us  to  destroy  these  Rangers  of  the  Night, 
but  we  are  loath  to  lose  the  fruits  of  austerity,  earned  over 
a  long  period. 

"  'Prolonged  penance  is  subject  to  innumerable  hindrances, 
and  is  exceedingly  hard,  O  Rama !  For  this  reason  we  refrain 
from  pronouncing  a  curse  on  these  demons,  though  they 
devour  us.  Tormented  thus  by  the  titans  who  frequent  the 
Dandaka  Forest,  we  implore  thee  and  thy  brother  to  protect 
us;  thou  art  our  support.' " 

"Hearing  these  words,  I  promised  my  protection  to  the 
sages  of  the  Dandaka  Forest,  O  Daughter  of  Janaka ! 

"  As  long  as  I  live,  therefore,  I  cannot  violate  the  promise 
given  to  the  ascetics. 

"  I  may  yield  up  my  life  or  even  thee,  O  Sita,  as  well  as 
Lakshmana,  but  I  cannot  be  false  to  a  vow  made  to  brahmins. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Even  had  I  not  promised  them  anything,  O  Vaidehi,  it  is 
my  bounden  duty  to  protect  die  sages ;  how  much  more  so 
now! 

"I  am  pleased  with  thee,  O  Sita,  for  one  does  not  offer 
advice  to  those  one  does  not  love.  Thy  words  are  worthy  of 
thee,  O  Beautiful  One.  By  pursuing  die  path  of  duty  thou 
hast  become  dearer  to  me  than  life  itself." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Sita,  the  daughter  of  the  King  of 
Mithila,  the  magnanimous  Rama,  carrying  his  bow,  continued 
to  roam  through  those  ravishing  solitudes  with  Lakshmana. 


CHAPTER     I  I 

Rama  visits  the  different  Retreats  and  hears  of  Agastya 

Walking  ahead,  Rama  was  followed  by  Sita,  while  behind  her 
came  Lakshmana,  bow  in  hand.  With  Sita,  they  proceeded 
further,  seeing  many  hills  and  plains,  woods  and  enchanting 
rivers  with  geese  and  cranes  frequenting  their  banks  and  pools 
covered  with  lotuses,  abounding  in  waterfowl,  and  herds  of 
deer,  horned  buffaloes  in  rut,  bears  and  elephants,  the  destroyers 
of  trees. 

Having  travelled  a  great  distance,  they  beheld,  as  the  sun 
was  setting,  a  marvellous  lake,  some  four  miles  in  length, 
carpeted  with  lotus  and  water-lily  blooms,  graced  with  herds 
of  wild  elephants  and  abounding  in  geese,  swans  and  teal. 

From  this  enchanting  lake  of  tranquil  waters,  the  sound  of 
singing  and  musical  instruments  could  be  heard,  yet  no  one 
was  visible  there.  Captivated,  Rama  and  Lakshmana  began  to 
question  a  sage  named  Dharmabhrit,  saying : — 

"  O  Great  Ascetic,  this  wonderful  music,  heard  by  us  all, 
moves  us  strangely;  what  can  it  be?  Be  gracious  enough 
to  tell  us." 

Thus  questioned  by  Raghava,  the  magnanimous  sage  began 
at  once  to  relate  the  history  of  that  magic  lake. 

He  said : — "  This  lake,  called  Panchapsara,1  is  always  filled 

1  Panchapsara — '  Lake  of  Five  Apsaras  I ' 


ARANYA    KANDA 

with  water  and  was  created  by  the  penances  of  the  Sage 
Mandarkini. 

"  Practising  a  rigid  asceticism,  this  great  sage,  lying  in  water 
for  thousands  of  years,  lived  on  air  alone  1  Then  the  Gods  with 
Agni  at  their  head  became  agitated  and,  coming  together,  said 
to  each  other : — *  This  sage  aspires  to  our  state !  *  Thus  did 
they  speak,  their  minds  full  of  apprehension. 

"  Then  all  the  Gods,  in  order  to  destroy  the  merit  of  the 
sage  acquired  through  his  penances,  sent  down  five  of  the 
most  beautiful  nymphs,  whose  complexion  resembled  lightning 
and,  though  the  ascetic  was  fully  conversant  with  what  was 
good  and  evil,  he  was  captivated  by  those  nymphs  and  fell 
under  the  sway  of  the  God  of  Love. 

"  These  five  nymphs  became  the  wives  of  that  sage,  who 
constructed  a  secret  dwelling  in  the  lake  for  them.  There  they 
live  happily,  bringing  delight  to  the  ascetic,  who  by  virtue  of 
his  penances  has  become  youthful.  They  pass  their  time  in 
dalliance  and  this  is  the  cause  of  the  entrancing  music  mingling 
with  the  tinkling  of  their  ornaments." 

Such  was  the  strange  tale  recounted  by  that  sage  of  pure  soul. 

Conversing  thus,  the  illustrious  Rama  and  his  brother 
visited  the  circle  of  hermitages,  strewn  with  kusha  grass  and 
bark,  which  were  resplendent  with  the  lustre  of  the  brahmins. 
Accompanied  by  Vaidehi  and  Lakshmana,  the  Descendant  of 
Raghu,  Kakutstha  penetrated  into  the  blessed  circle  of  those 
Lions  among  Men. 

Received  with  delight  and  honoured  by  those  great  rishis, 
Rama  roamed  through  the  silent  woods,  that  great  warrior 
sojourning  with  the  ascetics,  sometimes  for  ten  months,  some- 
times for  a  year,  sometimes  for  four  months  or  five  or  six 
months,  sometimes  for  many  months  or  a  month  and  a  half 
only,  sometimes  three  months  and  sometimes  eight.  In  this 
way,  engaged  in  innocent  pastimes,  ten  years  passed  away. 

Having  visited  all  the  retreats  of  the  ascetics,  Rama  returned 
to  Sutikshna's  hermitage  and,  receiving  the  homage  of  the 
sages,  that  Subduer  of  his  Foes  remained  there  awhile. 

One  day,  as  he  sat  at  the  feet  of  the  ascetic,  in  all  humility 
he  addressed  him,  saying : — 

"  O  Blessed  One,  I  have  heard  that  Agastya,  that  foremost 
23 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  sages,  dwells  in  this  forest,  but  it  is  so  vast,  that  I  do  not 
know  where  his  hermitage  is  to  be  found.  Where  does  the 
retreat  of  that  sagacious  Rishi  lie  ?  By  thy  favour,  O  Blessed 
Lord,  I,  my  younger  brother  and  Sita  wish  to  pay  our  respects 
to  him.'' 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  virtuous  Rama,  that  illustrious  sage, 
Sutikshna,  well  pleased,  answered  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  saying: — 

"  It  was  my  intention  to  speak  of  this  to  thee  and  Lakshmana, 
O  Raghava  and  say :  '  Do  thou,  with  Sita,  seek  out  Agastya.' 
Now  thou  thyself  hast  proposed  it  and  it  is  well.  I  will 
now  tell  thee,  O  Rama,  where  that  great  Ascetic  Agastya  dwells. 

"  My  Quid,  four  miles  from  here  to  the  south,  thou  wilt 
come  to  the  hermitage  of  the  brother  of  Agastya,  situated  in 
a  fertile  plain,  covered  with  charming  groves  of  fig,  abounding 
in  fruit  and  flowers,  where  the  song  of  many  birds  may  be 
heard.  Innumerable  lakes  of  tranquil  water,  carpeted  by 
lotuses  and  frequented  by  swans,  ducks  and  geese  add  to  its 
beauty.  Having  passed  the  night  there,  do  thou  at  dawn 
follow  the  path,  through  a  glade,  to  the  south  and  there  thou 
shalt  come  upon  Agastya's  retreat,  at  four  miles  distance, 
in  an  enchanting  spot  planted  with  lovely  trees.  This  place 
will  charm  Vaidehi  as  well  as  Lakshmana  and  thee,  for  this 
corner  of  the  forest  shaded  by  innumerable  trees,  is  ravishing. 

"  Shouldst  thou  desire  to  visit  that  great  ascetic,  Agastya, 
then  set  out  to-day,  O  Prince  of  Surpassing  Wisdom." 

At  these  words,  Rama  with  Lakshmana  and  Sita,  having 
made  obeisance  to  Sutikshna,  set  out  to  seek  the  Sage  Agastya. 

Enjoying  the  marvellous  woods  and  hills,  which  resembled  a 
mass  of  clouds,  and  the  lakes  and  rivers  to  be  seen  on  the  way, 
Rama  proceeded  quickly  along  the  path  pointed  out  by  the 
sage  Sutikshna,  and  full  of  delight  that  magnanimous  One 
said  to  Lakshmana : — 

"  Assuredly,  this  must  be  the  retreat  of  the  illustrious 
brother  of  Agastya,  that  sage  of  blessed  karma,  that  we  now 
behold.  Observe  how  along  the  woodland  ride  thousands  of 
trees,  bowed  with  the  weight  of  their  fruit  and  flowers,  can  be 
seen,  and  the  pungent  odour  of  ripe  figs  is  borne  on  the  breeze. 
Here  and  there  heaps  of  fire-wood  lie,  with  darbha  grass,  the 
colour  of  lapis  lazuli ;  see  also  that  column  of  smoke,  like  a 
24 


ARANYA    KANDA 

plume  of  dark  cloud,  rising  in  the  forest  from  a  fire  freshly 
lit  in  the  hermitage. 

"  Having  performed  their  ablutions  in  the  sacred  ponds,  the 
Twice-born  are  offering  flowers  they  themselves  have  gathered. 
The  words  spoken  by  Sutikshna  have  proved  true  O  Friend. 
Here  indeed  is  the  retreat  of  Agastya's  brother. 

"  In  his  desire  to  be  of  service  to  the  worlds,  by  virtue  of  his 
austerities  that  great  sage  overcame  death  and  set  apart  this 
quarter  as  a  place  of  refuge. 

"  Here  formerly  the  cruel  demons  Vatapi  and  Ilvala  lived, 
two  great  asuras  who  together  conceived  a  plan  for  slaying  the 
brahmins. 

"  Assuming  the  form  of  a  sage,  the  pitiless  Ilvala,  using  the 
sanskrita  language,  invited  the  ascetics  to  partake  of  a  feast. 
Preparing  his  brother  disguised  as  a  ram  in  a  dish,  he  fed  the 
Twice-born,  according  to  traditional  rites.  When  the  ascetics 
had  eaten,  Ilvala  cried  out  in  a  loud  voice : — *  O  Vatapi,  come 
forth.* 

"  At  the  sound  of  his  voice,  Vatapi,  bleating  like  a  ram, 
tearing  the  bodies  of  the  ascetics,  emerged. 

"  Thus  thousands  of  brahmins  were  slain  by  those  devourers 
of  human  flesh,  who  changed  their  shape  at  will  and  were  full 
of  deceit. 

"  At  the  request  of  the  Gods,  the  great  Rishi  Agastya  went 
to  the  feast  and  ate  up  the  huge  asura,  after  which  Ilvala  said: — 
'  It  is  well,'  and  offering  the  guest  water  to  wash  his  hands, 
cried  out : — *  Come  forth  O  Vatapi ! ' 

"  But  as  this  Slayer  of  Ascetics  was  speaking  thus,  Agastya, 
that  excellent  sage,  breaking  into  laughter,  said  to  him : — 

" '  How  can  that  demon  come  forth,  since  I  have  consumed 
him  ?  Thy  brother  in  the  shape  of  a  ram,  has  entered  the 
abode  of  Yama.' 

"  Hearing  that  his  brother  was  dead,  the  demon  in  anger 
rushed  at  the  ascetic,  hurling  himself  on  that  Indra  of  the 
Twice-born,  but  the  sage,  blazing  with  spiritual  power,  by  a 
single  glance  consumed  him,  and  he  perished. 

"  This  is  the  hermitage,  beautified  by  lakes  and  groves, 
belonging  to  the  brother  of  that  sage,  who  in  compassion  for 
the  ascetics  performed  that  arduous  feat." 
25 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

While  Rama  was  speaking  thus  to  Saumitri,  the  sun  set 
behind  the  mountain  and  the  night  drew  on ;  duly  performing 
his  evening  devotions,  he  entered  the  hermitage  and  offered 
obeisance  to  the  ascetic 

Warmly  received  by  that  blessed  one,  Raghava  passed  the 
night  there,  having  partaken  of  fruit  and  roots  and,  when 
morning  came  and  the  disc  of  the  sun  was  visible,  he  paid 
homage  to  the  brother  of  Agastya,  saying : — 

"  Reverent  Sir,  I  salute  thee  and  thank  thee  for  the  peaceful 
night  I  have  passed  here,  I  will  now  go  and  seek  out  my  spiritual 
preceptor,  thine  elder  brother." 

"  So  be  it,"  replied  the  sage,  whereupon  the  descendant  of 
Raghu  went  along  the  path  pointed  out  to  him,  enjoying  the 
forest  with  the  innumerable  Nirvara,  Panasa,  Sala,  Vanjula, 
Tinisha,  Shiribilwa,  Madhuka,  Bilwa  and  Tinduka  trees  in 
full  flower  entwined  with  blossoming  creepers,  and  trees 
ripped  by  the  trunks  of  elephants,  where  monkeys  disported 
themselves  and  which  resounded  to  the  warbling  of  a  myriad 
birds. 

Then  the  lotus-eyed  Rama  said  to  the  valiant  and  heroic 
Lakshmana,  who  was  following  him : — 

"  From  the  glossy  foliage  of  the  trees  and  the  lameness  of 
the  deer  and  the  birds,  we  are  undoubtedly  not  far  distant 
from  the  retreat  of  that  great  and  pure-souled  Rishi  of  virtuous 
practices. 

"  This  hermitage  that  removes  all  weariness,  belonging  to 
the  Sage  Agastya,  well  known  among  men  for  his  virtue,  with 
its  groves  filled  with  a  rare  fragrance,  its  robes  of  bark  and 
garlands  hanging  here  and  there,  frequented  by  herds  of  tame 
deer,  the  leafy  boughs  pervaded  by  countless  birds,  can  now  be 
seen  by  us. 

"  Having  overcome  Mrityu  by  his  power,  in  his  desire  to 
do  good  to  the  whole  world,  he  created  this  inviolate  refuge  in 
the  south,  which  is  eschewed  by  demons  who  fear  to  lay  it  waste, 

"  From  the  day  that  this  region  was  rendered  habitable  by 
that  virtuous  ascetic,  the  demons  have  ceased  to  exercise  their 
hatred  and  cruelty  here.  This  fortunate  land  of  the  South, 
famed  in  the  Three  Worlds,  associated  with  the  name  of  that 
blessed  sage,  is  no  longer  haunted  by  those  wicked  beings. 
26 


ARANYA    KANDA 

"  The  mountain  Vindhya,  foremost  of  its  kind,  that  threatened 
to  intercept  the  rays  of  the  sun,  dared  not  grow  higher, 
submitting  to  Agastya's  command  and  this  enchanting  retreat, 
frequented  by  deer,  belongs  to  that  long-lived  one  of  exalted 
achievement.  The  virtuous  Agastya,  honoured  by  men,  who 
is  ever  engaged  in  the  welfare  of  all  beings,  will  on  our  arrival 
accord  us  a  great  welcome. 

"  I  wish  to  pay  homage  to  that  great  ascetic  personally  and 
to  pass  the  rest  of  mine  exile  in  the  forest  with  him,  O  Mild 
One !  Here  the  Gods,  Gandharvas,  Siddhas  and  the  great 
Sages,  who  live  on  a  bare  subsistence,  constantly  pay  homage 
to  the  Sage  Agastya,  but  dishonest,  cruel,  wicked  and  perverse 
men  are  not  able  to  remain  in  the  presence  of  that  great  ascetic. 

"The  Immortals,  however,  the  Yakshas  and  those  of  the 
Serpent  Race,  the  great  Rishis  also,  dedicated  to  virtuous 
living,  dwell  here,  and  fixed  in  holiness,  those  exalted  beings, 
discarding  their  worn-out  bodies,  assuming  new  ones,  ascend 
to  heaven  in  chariots  resembling  the  sun. 

"  There  the  Gods  fulfil  the  desires  of  the  virtuous,  granting 
them  immortality,  divine  powers  and  every  degree  of  majesty. 

"  We  have  now  come  to  the  hermitage,  O  Saumitri,  do  thou 
enter  it  and  announce  my  arrival  with  Sita,  to  the  Rishi." 


CHAPTER     12 

Agastya  receives  Rama  into  his  Hermitage 

Having  entered  the  hermitage,  Lakshmana,  the  younger 
brother  of  Raghava,  approached  a  disciple  of  Agastya  and  said 
to  him : — 

"  The  eldest  son  of  King  Dasaratha,  the  illustrious  Rama, 
has  come  with  his  consort,  Sita,  to  pay  homage  to  the  sage. 
I  am  his  younger  brother,  obedient  and  devoted  to  him  and 
his  humble  servant ;  perchance  thou  hast  heard  of  us  ? 

"  We  have  penetrated  into  this  dangerous  forest  at  the 
command  of  our  royal  sire.     We  three  desire  to  see  the  blessed 
One,  do  thou  make  it  known  to  him." 
27 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Hearing  Lakshmana's  words,  the  disciple  said : — "  So  be  it ! " 
and  went  to  inform  Agastya  at  the  place  where  the  sacred  fire 
burned.  With  joined  palms  approaching  that  Foremost  of 
Munis  whose  austerities  had  rendered  him  invincible,  he 
conveyed  the  news  of  Rama's  arrival  to  him. 

In  conformity  with  Lakshmana's  words,  the  cherished 
disciple  of  Agastya  said : — "  The  two  sons  of  King  Dasaratha, 
Rama  and  Lakshmana,  have  come  to  the  hermitage  with  Sita. 
These  two  warriors,  Conquerors  of  their  Foes,  have  come  to 
look  on  thee  and  to  offer  their  services ;  be  gracious  enough 
to  instruct  me  in  what  should  now  be  done !  " 

Having  heard  from  his  disciple  that  Rama,  followed  by 
Lakshmana  and  the  auspicious  Vaidehi,  were  waiting,  Agastya 
answered : — "  How  fortunate  that  after  so  long  a  time  Rama 
has  come  to  see  me  to-day.  It  was  ever  the  desire  of  my 
heart  to  behold  that  great  prince.  Bid  Rama  welcome  and 
ask  him  to  enter  together  with  his  consort  and  Lakshmana  who 
accompanies  him;  let  them  be  brought  into  my  presence; 
why  has  this  not  already  been  done  ?  " 

Thus  addressed  by  that  mighty  muni,  learned  in  the  spiritual 
tradition,  the  disciple  saluted  him  with  joined  palms  and  said  : 
"  Be  it  so ! "  Thereafter,  issuing  from  the  hermitage,  he 
approached  Lakshmana  and  addressed  him,  saying : — 
"  Which  of  you  is  Rama  ?  Let  him  enter  and  approach  the  sage." 

Thereupon  Lakshmana,  moving  nearer  to  the  gateway  of  the 
hermitage,  pointed  out  Rama  and  Sita,  the  daughter  of  Janaka, 
to  him,  and  the  disciple  humbly  communicated  Rishi  Agastya's 
message,  conducting  Rama  into  the  hermitage. 

Rama,  accompanied  by  Sita  and  Lakshmana,  entering  the 
enclosure,  which  was  filled  with  tame  deer,  observed  the  altars 
set  up  to  Brahma  and  Agni  and  also  the  sacred  places  dedicated 
to  Vishnu,  Mahendra,  Vivaswat,  Soma,  Bhaga,  Kuvera, 
Dhatar  and  Vidhatar,  Vayu,  the  God  who  holds  the  Thread  in 
his  hand,1  the  magnanimous  Varuna,  Gayatri,  the  Vasus,  the 
Nagas,  Garuda,  Karttikeya  and  Dharma. 

Escorted  by  the  disciple,  he  saw  all  these  and  suddenly 
beheld  the  great  sage  himself.  Seeing  him  at  the  head  of  the 
ascetics,  blazing  with  the  lustre  acquired  by  the  practice  of 

i  Yama— The  God  of  Death. 

28 


ARANYA    KANDA 

austerities,  the  valiant  Rama  said  to  Lakshmana,  the  increaser 
of  his  delight : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  behold  that  blessed  ascetic,  Agastya,  leaving 
the  place  of  sacrifice ;  it  is  with  pride  that  I  bow  before  that 
treasury  of  renunciation." 

Speaking  thus  of  Agastya,  who  shone  like  the  sun,  whilst 
he  advanced  towards  him,  the  joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu 
took  hold  of  his  feet  and  paid  obeisance  to  him.  Having 
saluted  him,  the  virtuous  Raina  stood  before  him  with  joined 
palms,  in  company  with  Videha's  daughter  and  Saumitri. 

Thereafter,  embracing  Kakutstha  and  honouring  him  with 
water  and  a  seat,  questioning  him  as  to  his  welfare,  the  saint 
bade  him  welcome  according  to  the  tradition  of  the  forest. 
Offering  oblations  into  the  fire,  and  presenting  his  guests  with 
the  arghya,  that  ascetic  entertained  them  with  food  and  placing 
himself  at  the  side  of  Rama,  who,  conversant  with  his  duty, 
sat  with  joined  palms,  said  to  him  : — 

"  O  Prince,  an  ascetic  who  fails  to  offer  proper  hospitality 
will  feed  on  his  own  flesh  in  the  other  world,  as  does  one  who 
bears  false  witness.  O  Lord  of  the  Universe,  Observer  of  Thy 
Duty,  Warrior  of  the  Great  Car,  who  art  worthy  of  all  honour 
and  respect,  thou  art  come  at  last  and  art  my  beloved  guest." 

With  these  words,  the  Sage  Agastya,  as  a  symbol  of  homage, 
offered  Rama  fruits,  roots,  flowers,  water  and  other  things  in 
great  profusion,  and  said  to  him : — 

"  Here  is  a  celestial  and  powerful  bow,  encrusted  with  gold 
and  diamonds,  that  belonged  to  Vishnu.  O  Tiger  among  Men, 
it  is  the  creation  of  Vishwakarma. 

"  Here  also  is  the  Brahmadatta  dart,  which  is  infallible  and 
resembles  the  sun ;  it  is  pre-eminent  and  was  given  to  me  by 
Mahendra ;  here  also  are  these  two  inexhaustible  quivers, 
filled  with  sharp  arrows  that  blaze  like  torches  and  here  a 
mighty  silver  scabbard  and  a  sword  decorated  with  gold. 

"  With  this  bow,  O  Rama,  Vishnu  slew  the  great  asura  in 
battle  and  formerly  acquired  inexpressible  glory  amongst  the 
dwellers  in  the  celestial  regions. 

"  This  bow,  these  two  quivers,  the  dart  and  the  sword, 
pledges  of  victory,  do  thou  accept,  O  Proud  Warrior,  and  bear 
them  as  Vajradhara  the  thunderbolt.*' 
29 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Thus  speaking,  the  illustrious  and  fortunate  Agastya  gave  to 
Rama  the  whole  panoply  of  weapons  belonging  to  the  mighty 
Vishnu,  and  once  more  addressed  him : — 


chapter    13 

Rama  goes  to  Panchavati  on  the  advice  of  Agastya 

"  O  Rama,  may  happiness  attend  thee !  O  Lakshmana,  I  am 
pleased  with  thee  that  with  Sita  thou  hast  come  hither  to 
pay  me  homage.  Undoubtedly  the  long  journey  will  have 
wearied  you  both,  as  also  Maithili,  whose  sighs  betray  it. 

"  That  youthful  lady,  who  is  unaccustomed  to  exertion,  has 
come  to  the  forest  out  of  love  for  her  lord,  though  the  way  is 
beset  with  difficulties ;  therefore,  O  Rama,  do  that  which  will 
give  her  pleasure. 

"  Since  the  beginning  of  time,  O  Joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu, 
it  has  been  woman's  nature  to  cling  to  a  man  in  prosperity 
and  abandon  him  in  adversity.  Swift  as  lightning  in  thought, 
sharp  as  a  sword  in  speech,  her  moods  comparable  to  an  eagle's 
flight,  such  is  woman !  But  thy  consort  is  wholly  free  from 
these  defects,  she  is  worthy  of  praise  and  is  the  foremost  of 
those  devoted  to  their  lord ;  amongst  the  Gods  she  is  known 
as  a  second  Arundhati.  That  region  will  be  renowned  where 
thou,  Saumitri  and  this  princess  have  sojourned,  O  Conqueror 
of  Thy  Foes." 

Thus  did  the  sage  address  Raghava,  who,  with  joined  palms, 
in  humble  accents,  answered  that  ascetic  who  shone  like  a 
flame,  saying: — 

"I  am  overwhelmed  with  favour,  since  the  foremost  among 
ascetics  is  gratified  with  me,  as  also  with  my  brother  and  my 
consort  who  accompany  me. 

"  Do  thou  direct  me  to  a  place  abounding  in  trees,  and  with 
abundant  water,  where  we  can  dwell  in  peace  and  happiness." 

Hearing  Rama's  words,  that  excellent  and  magnanimous 
sage,  reflecting  an  instant,  made  this  judicious  reply : — 

"  My  Dear  Son,  at  eight  miles  distance  from  here,  is  a  spot 
30 


ARANYA    KANDA 

known  by  the  name  of  Panchavati,  where  roots,  fruit  and 
water  abound  and  where  there  are  many  deer.  Go  thither  and 
with  Saumitri  establish  a  hermitage,  living  there  happily  and 
carrying  out  the  behests  of  thy  sire. 

"  By  the  power  of  my  penance  and  by  virtue  of  the  affection 
I  bore  for  King  Dasaratha,  I  am  acquainted  with  thy  history, 
O  Irreproachable  Prince.  Though  thou  hast  promised  to 
remain  with  me  in  these  solitudes,  yet  mine  austerities  have 
revealed  to  me  the  true  desires  of  thine  heart.  Therefore  I 
say  to  thee  again  :  '  Seek  out  Panchavati ! '  It  is  an  enchanting 
woodland,  that  will  delight  Maithili.  That  place,  worthy  of 
all  praise,  is  not  far  from  here,  O  Raghava,  and  is  close  to  the 
Godaveri  river;  Sita  will  be  happy  there.  Abounding  in 
roots,  fruit  and  every  kind  of  bird,  it  is  set  apart,  O  Long- 
armed  Hero,  and  is  lovely,  delightful  and  sacred.  Thou  of 
righteous  ways,  who  art  ever  active  and  able  to  defend  all 
beings,  wilt  dwell  there,  O  Rama,  in  order  to  protect  the  ascetics. 
To  the  north  of  the  Madhuka  woods,  which  thou  art  able 
to  see  from  here,  O  Hero,  thou  wilt  find  a  grove  of  fig  trees. 
Scale  the  mountain  ridges,  not  far  distant,  and  thou  shalt  come 
upon  the  renowned  Panchavati,  lying  there  with  its  flowering 
woods." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  Sage  Agastya,  Rama,  accompanied 
by  Saumitri,  took  leave  of  that  illustrious  ascetic,  and  having 
circumambulated  him,  paid  homage  to  his  feet  and  with  his 
permission  departed  towards  the  solitudes  of  Panchavati, 
accompanied  by  Sita. 

The  two  princes,  invincible  in  combat,  taking  up  their 
bows  and  strapping  on  their  quivers,  resolutely  followed  the 
path  to  Panchavati,  pointed  out  by  the  great  sage. 


chapter    14 

Jatayu  reveals  Ms  Lineage  to  Rama 

As  he  was  proceeding  to  Panchavati,  that  descendant  of  Raghu 
observed  a  large  and  powerful  vulture.     Seeing  that  bird  in 
the  woods,  the  two  illustrious  princes,  Rama  and  Lakshmana, 
3i 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

thinking  him  to  be  a  demon  in  another  form,  said  to  him: 
"  Who  art  thou  ?  " 

Then,  in  gentle  caressing  tones,  the  bird,  as  though 
addressing  one  dear  to  him,  answered,  saying :  "  Dear  Child, 
know  me  to  be  the  friend  of  thy  sire ! " 

In  deference  to  this  relationship,  Raghava  paid  obeisance  to 
him,  and  enquired  of  him  concerning  his  name  and  lineage, 
and  he,  hearing  Rama's  words,  said : — 

"  In  a  former  age  there  existed  the  Prajapatis,  whom  I  will 
enumerate — the  first  of  them  was  Kardama  and  immediately 
succeeding  him  was  Vikrita,  then  came  Shesha  and  Samshraya, 
the  father  of  many  powerful  sons,  thereafter  came  Sthanu, 
Marichi,  Atri,  Kratu  who  was  full  of  energy,  Poulastya,  Angira, 
Pracheta,  Pulaha  and  Daksha  followed  by  Vivaswat  and 
Arishtanemi;  O  Raghava,  the  renowned  Kashyapa  was  the 
last  of  these.  O  Hero  of  Infinite  Renown,  we  have  heard 
that  Prajapati  Daksha  had  sixty  lovely  and  illustrious  daughters. 
Kashyapa  wedded  eight  of  these  damsels  of  elegant  waist, 
Aditi,  Diti,  Kalika,  Tamra,  Krodhavasa,  Manu  and  Anila  and 
well  pleased,  said  to  them :  '  Do  ye  all  beget  sons,  like  unto 
myself,  who  shall  be  Lords  of  the  Three  Worlds.' 

"  Thereupon  Aditi  consented,  O  Rama,  as  did  Diti,  Danu 
and  Kalika,  but  the  others  refused. 

"  Aditi  became  the  mother  of  the  Thirty-three  Immortals. 
O  My  Son,  Diti  gave  birth  to  the  illustrious  Daityas ;  it  was 
to  them  that  the  earth  with  its  seas  and  forests  belonged. 

"  Danu  gave  birth  to  a  son  named  Ashagriva,  O  Subduer  of 
thy  Foes,  and  Kalika  gave  birth  to  Naraka  and  Kalaka ; 
and  the  five  famous  daughters,  Kraunchi,  Bhasi,  Shyeni, 
Dhritarashtri  and  Shuki  were  produced  by  Tamra. 

"  Kraunchi  begot  the  owls  and  Bhasi  the  vultures  ;  Shyeni 
was  the  mother  of  the  hawks  and  eagles  possessed  of  great 
energy ;  Dhritarashtri,  of  swans,  flamingoes  and  water- 
fowl. 

"  The  beautiful  Shuki  begot  Nata  whose  daughter  was 
Vinata.  O  Rama,  Krodhavasa  brought  forth  ten  daughters : 
Mrigi,  Mrigimanda,  Hari,  Bhadramada,  Matangi,  Sharduli, 
Sheveta,  Surabhi  and  Surasa,  who  were  all  endowed  with 
beauty;  finally  Kadruka  was  born. 
3* 


ARANYA    KANDA 

"  O  First  of  Men,  Mrigi  became  the  mother  of  all  the  deer ; 
Mrigamanda  begot  bears,  buffaloes  and  yaks. 

"  Bhadramada  had  a  daughter  named  Iravati  who  was  the 
mother  of  Airavata,  who  is  the  guardian  of  the  world. 

"  Hari  gave  birth  to  powerful  lions  and  monkeys,  lovers  of 
the  forest ;  Sharduli  begot  chimpanzees  and  tigers.  Of 
Matangi  were  born  elephants,  O  Kakutstha,  O  Best  of  Men  1 
Shiveta  gave  birth  to  the  elephants  who  support  the  earth. 

"  Two  daughters  were  born  of  the  Goddess  Surabhi :  Rohini, 
and  the  auspicious  Gandharvi. 

"  Rohini  produced  cows,  and  Gandharvi  brought  forth 
horses.  Sarasa  was  the  mother  of  the  hooded  serpents,  O 
Rama,  and  Kadru  gave  birth  to  all  other  snakes. 

"  Manu,  wife  of  the  magnanimous  Kashyapa,  gave  birth  to 
men,  Brahmins  Kshattriyas,  Vaisyas  and  Shudras,  O  Lion 
amongst  Men. 

"According  to  tradition,  from  her  mouth  were  born  the 
Brahmins,  from  her  breasts  the  Kshattriyas,  from  her  thighs 
the  Vaishyas  and  from  her  feet  the  Shudras. 

"  AH  the  trees  with  succulent  fruits  were  bora  of  Anala. 

"  Vinata,  whose  grandmother  was  Shuki,  herself  begot  Kadru 
and  her  sister,  Surasa. 

"  Of  Kadru  were  born  thousands  of  serpents,  the  supporters 
of  the  earth,  and  Vinata  had  two  sons,  Garuda  and  Aruna. 

*'  Know  that  I  was  born  of  Aruna,  as  also  was  Sampati,  my 
elder  brother.  My  name  is  Jatayu,  the  descendant  of  Shyeni, 
O  Subduer  of  Thine  Enemies. 

"  O  My  dear  Child,  I  will  take  up  my  abode  in  thy  vicinity, 
if  thou  so  desire  it,  and  keep  watch  over  Sita,  whilst  thou  art 
away  with  Lakshmana." 

Raghava,  having  often  heard  of  his  father's  friendship  with 
the  vulture,  was  filled  with  delight,  and  embraced  him  with 
affection,  paying  obeisance  to  him. 

Having  requested  that  powerful  bird  to  keep  watch  over 
Sita,  he  went  on  towards  Panchavati  with  him,  accompanied 
by  Lakshmana,  firmly  resolving  to  destroy  his  enemies  and 
duly  observing  his  daily  devotions.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     I  5 

Rama  takes  up  his  Abode  in  Panchavati 

When  he  had  reached  Panchavati,  frequented  by  wild  beasts 
and  deer,  Rama  said  to  his  brother  Lakshmana,  who  was 
burning  with  energy  : — 

"  O  Dear  One,  we  have  reached  the  place  described  by  the 
sage,  this  woodland  of  flowering  trees,  the  much-loved 
Panchavati.  O  Thou  who  art  full  of  resource,  look  about  on 
every  side  and  ascertain  in  which  spot  it  is  fitting  for  us  to 
construct  our  hermitage.  Let  it  be  in  the  vicinity  of  a  pool 
where  the  charm  of  the  forest  and  the  water  adds  to  its  beauty, 
where  thou,  Sita  and  I,  may  dwell  in  peace,  where  flowers, 
fuel  and  kusha  grass  abound." 

Hearing  the  words  of  Rama,  the  offspring  of  Kakutstha, 
Lakshmana,  with  joined  palms,  in  the  presence  of  Sita,  answered 
him: — 

"  Wert  thou  to  live  a  hundred  years,  I  should  still  be  thy 
servant,  O  Kakutstha  !  Do  thou  select  some  place  favoured  by 
thee  and  command  me  to  build  a  retreat." 

Well  pleased  with  Lakshmana's  compliance,  that  illustrious 
hero,  looking  here  and  there,  chose  a  site  which  combined 
every  advantage,  and  on  that  spot,  taking  the  hand  of  Saumitri 
in  his,  said : — 

"  Here  is  a  level  place  that  is  pleasant  and  surrounded  by 
trees;  it  is  here  that  I  desire  thee  to  construct  a  retreat. 
Nearby  is  an  enchanting  river,  rendered  beautiful  by  lotuses, 
bright  as  the  sun,  exhaling  a  delicious  fragrance,  as  described 
to  me  by  that  Rishi  of  pure  soul,  Agastya.  This  is  the  delightful 
river  Godaveri,  bordered  with  flowering  trees,  teeming  with 
swans  and  waterfowl,  geese  enhancing  its  beauty  and  thronged 
with  herds  of  deer,  neither  too  near  nor  too  far  away,  that 
come  here  to  drink. 

"  And  re-echoing  to  the  cry  of  peacocks,  lovely  hills  covered 
with  blossoming  trees  containing  many  a  cave,  resembled  great 
34 


ARANYA    KANDA 

elephants  with  huge  howdahs  embroidered  in  gold,  silver  and 
copper,  that  are  studded  here  and  there  with  tiny  mirrors. 

"  Sala,  Tala,  Tamala,  Kharjura,  Panasa,  Nivara,  Tinisha 
and  Punnaga  trees  are  their  decoration,  while  Cuta,  Ashoka, 
Tilaka,  Ketaka  and  Champaka  entwined  with  flowering  creepers 
and  plants,  abound  as  also  Syandana,  Chandana,  Nipa,  Panasa, 
Lakuka,  Dhara,  Ashwakarna,  Khadira,  Shami,  Tinduka  and 
Patala  trees.  In  this  sacred  place,  this  enchanting  spot  filled 
with  deer  and  birds,  let  us  dwell  with  Jatayu,  O  Saumitri." 

Thus  addressed  by  his  brother  Rama,  Lakshmana,  Slayer 
of  Hostile  Warriors,  endowed  with  great  energy,  built  him  a 
retreat  there  without  delay  and  constructed  a  spacious  hut 
with  walls  of  mud,  supported  by  strong  stakes  made  of  long 
graceful  bamboos,  thatched  with  boughs  of  the  Shami  tree. 

Creepers,  kusha  and  sarpat  grass  strengthened  it,  while  reeds 
and  leaves  were  also  used  for  the  roof,  its  floor  being  well 
levelled. 

Then  the  fortunate  Lakshmana,  having  constructed  that 
excellent  hut,  lovely  to  behold,  went  to  the  river  Godaveri, 
and  after  bathing,  gathered  lotuses  and  fruit,  returning  to  the 
hermitage  to  offer  the  flowers  there  and  perform  those  traditional 
rites  proper  to  the  peace  of  that  dwelling,  thereafter  leading 
Rama  to  the  hut  he  had  set  up. 

Seeing  that  charming  retreat  and  the  thatched  hut,  Raghava, 
who  was  accompanied  by  Sita,  experienced  intense  delight. 

Highly  gratified,  he  pressed  Lakshmana  to  his  heart  and  in 
a  voice  full  of  tenderness  and  feeling,  said  to  him : — 

"  I  am  pleased  with  thee ;  thou  hast  accomplished  a  great 
feat,  O  My  Brother,  for  which  as  a  token  of  satisfaction  I  now 
embrace  thee.  Whilst  thou  dost  still  live,  with  thy  zeal,  thy 
devotion  and  thy  virtue,  O  Lakshmana,  our  illustrious  sire  is 
not  dead." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Lakshmana,  Raghava,  the  source  of 
others  prosperity,  began  to  dwell  happily  in  that  region 
abounding  in  fruit.  And  ministered  to  by  Sita  and  Lakshmana, 
that  illustrious  One  lived  there  with  them  for  some  time,  like  the 
Gods  in  heaven.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER     I  6 

Description  of  Winter  by  Lakshmana 

Whilst  the  magnanimous  Rama  was  sojourning  there,  autumn 
passed  away  and  the  winter  season  set  in. 

One  day  at  dawn,  the  issue  of  the  House  of  Raghu  went  to 
the  enchanting  river  Godaveri  to  perform  his  ablutions  and 
the  valiant  Saumitri,  pitcher  in  hand,  following  humbly  with 
Sita,  addressed  him,  saying : — 

"  Now  that  season  dear  to  thee  has  come,  O  Amiable  Prince, 
during  which  the  whole  year  seems  to  clothe  itself  in  splendour  ! 
The  ground  is  covered  with  frost  and  water  is  no  longer  pleasant 
to  drink. 

"  Having  offered  ripened  grain  to  the  Pitris  and  the  Gods, 
men  are  purified  of  their  sins,  their  sacrifices  having  been 
made  at  the  proper  season.  Desirous  of  the  necessities  of  life, 
all  are  now  abundantly  supplied  with  milk  and  butter. 

"  Kings,  dreaming  of  conquest,  set  out  on  their  campaigns. 
The  sun  veering  towards  the  southern  region,  beloved  of 
Antaka,  causes  the  north  to  resemble  a  woman,  whose  tilak 
mark  is  effaced.  The  Himavat  Mountain,  covered  with  snow, 
justly  bears  its  name.  Those  clear  days,  when  one  seeks  the 
sun  and  Sees  from  shade  and  damp,  are  exceedingly  pleasant, 
but  now  there  is  only  faint  sunshine,  constant  frost,  piercing 
cold  and  deep  snow.  The  long  cold  nights  are  with  us,  when 
it  is  no  longer  possible  to  lie  in  the  open,  and  the  Pushya  star 
which  served  as  a  beacon  is  now  obscured  in  the  snow-laden  air. 
The  moon,  that  draws  its  brilliance  from  the  sun,  no  longer 
shines,  and  its  frozen  disc  is  dim,  like  a  mirror  tarnished  by 
the  breath ;  wrinkled  by  the  cold,  that  orb's  surface,  though 
at  the  full,  no  longer  sends  forth  its  rays,  like  Sita,  when  her 
complexion,  tanned  by  the  sun,  loses  its  radiance. 

"Now  that  the  snow  is  blended  with  its  breath  the  west 
wind  is  icy,  and  the  mornings  are  bitingly  cold.  The  woods 
36 


ARANYA    KANDA 

are  shrouded  in  mist  and  the  fields  of  barley  and  wheat, 
covered  in  rime,  sparkle  in  the  rising  sun,  while  herons  and 
cranes  call  in  chorus.  Fields  of  rice  with  ears  resembling 
Kharjura  flowers  bend  gracefully  under  the  weight  of  the  gram. 
*'  With  its  rays  scarcely  penetrating  the  snow-laden  clouds, 
the  sun,  long  after  it  has  risen,  resembles  the  moon,  but 
gradually  gaining  strength  during  the  morning  hours,  rejoices 
the  heart  at  noon,  its  rays  shedding  a  pale  beauty  on  the  earth 
causing  the  woodland  rides,  covered  with  grass  and  drenched 
with  dew,  to  sparkle. 

"  The  wild  elephant,  suffering  from  extreme  thirst,  with- 
draws its  trunk  suddenly  on  coming  in  contact  with  the  frozen 
water,  and  the  waterfowl,  standing  on  the  banks,  dare  not 
enter  the  stream,  like  unto  cowardly  warriors,  fearful  of  setting 
foot  on  the  battlefield. 

"  Enveloped  in  dew  at  evening  and  wreathed  in  cold  grey 
mist  at  dawn,  the  trees,  bereft  of  flowers,  seem  to  sleep. 
Streams  are  shrouded  in  fog  and  the  cranes,  their  plumage 
hidden  under  the  snow,  can  only  be  distinguished  by  their 
cries ;   the  sands  on  the  banks  too  are  wet  with  snow. 

"  On  account  of  the  weakness  of  the  sun's  rays,  the  water 
remains  in  the  hollows  of  hard  rocks  after  the  fall  of  snow 
and  tastes  sweet.  The  lotuses  are  nipped  by  frost,  their 
stamens  dried  up,  their  petals  fallen,  only  the  stalks  remaining, 
and  in  the  grip  of  the  bitter  cold  have  lost  all  their  beauty. 

"  O  Lion  among  Men,  at  this  season,  in  devotion  to  thee, 
the  unfortunate  and  faithful  Bharata  is  undergoing  penance 
in  the  city.  Renouncing  kingdom,  pomp  and  every  pleasure, 
practising  austerity,  he  gives  himself  up  to  fasting  and  restraint, 
and  at  this  very  hour  is  certainly  making  bis  way  to  the  river 
Sarayu  surrounded  by  his  ministers  in  order  to  perform  his 
ablutions. 

"  Brought  up  in  luxury,  exceedingly  frail,  tormented  by  the 
cold,  how,  in  the  last  hour  of  the  night,  is  he  able  to  endure 
tie  icy  water  ? 

"  With  his  large  eyes  resembling  lotus  petals,  his  dark  skin 

and  depressed  navel,  that  great  and  virtuous  Bharata,  who  is 

dutiful,   truthful,   restrained,  his   senses  fully  controlled,   of 

sweet  speech  and  gentle,  that  long-armed  hero,  the  subduer 

37 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  his  foes,  renouncing  every  pleasure,  is  wholly  devoted  to 
thee,  O  Rama. 

"  My  Brother,  the  magnanimous  Bharata,  by  living  as  if 
banished  to  the  forest,  in  imitation  of  thee  resident  there,  has 
conquered  heaven,  O  Rama. 

"  It  is  said  that  a  man  resembles  his  mother  and  not  bis 
father.  If  it  be  so,  how  can  a  woman  as  cruel  as  Kaikeyi 
be  his  mother  ? " 

Thus  spoke  the  virtuous  Lakshmana  in  brotherly  affection, 
but  Rama,  unable  to  brook  their  mother  being  blamed,  answered 
him,  saying : — 

"  She  who  occupies  the  second  place  among  the  queens, 
O  My  Friend,  should  not  be  disparaged  in  any  way  whatsoever. 
Do  thou  continue  to  speak  of  Bharata,  the  protector  of  the 
House  of  Ikshwaku. 

"  Though  I  have  determined  to  dwell  in  the  forest,  yet  my 
love  for  Bharata  shakes  my  resolve  and  causes  me  to  waver 
anew.  I  recollect  his  gentle  and  affectionate  words  well, 
sweet  as  amrita,  delighting  the  soul.  O  when  shall  I  be  re- 
united with  the  magnanimous  Bharata  and  the  valiant 
Shatrughna,  together  with  thee,  O  Joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu?  " 

Lamenting  thus,  Kakutstha  came  to  the  Godaveri  river, 
where  he,  bis  younger  brother  and  Sita  performed  their  ablu- 
tions ;  then  having  offered  water  to  the  Gods  and  the  Fitris, 
those  sinless  ones  worshipped  the  rising  sun  and  the  Lord 
Narayana,  thus  purifying  themselves. 

Thereafter,  Rama,  accompanied  by  Sita  and  Lakshmana, 
appeared  beautiful,  resembling  the  Lord  Shiva  accompanied 
by  Nandi  and  the  Daughter  of  the  Mountains.1 


CHAPTER    i  7 

The  arrived  of  Shurpanakha  at  the  Hermitage 

Having  bathed  in  the  Godaveri  river,  Rama,  Sita  and  Lakshmana 
left  its  banks  and  returned  to  the  hermitage.  On  reaching 
their  retreat,  Raghava  with  Lakshmana  performed  their  morn- 
ing devotions  and  entered  the  leaf-thatched  hut.      In  the  hut, 

1  Girija,  a  name  of  ParvatL 

38 


ARANYA    KANDA 

that  long-armed  hero  with  Sita  at  his  side  dwelt  happily, 
honoured  by  the  great  Rishis,  and  shone  hke  the  moon  accom- 
panied by  the  Chitra  star. 

One  day,  while  Rama  was  reciting  the  traditional  texts,  a 
female  demon  chanced  to  pass  that  way,  by  name  Shurpanakha 
who  was  the  sister  of  Ravana. 

Approaching  Rama,  she  observed  that  he  resembled  a  God, 
with  his  radiant  countenance,  his  long  arms,  his  large  eyes 
like  unto  lotus  petals,  his  majestic  gait  resembling  an  elephant's, 
matted  locks  crowning  his  head ;  youthful,  full  of  valour, 
bearing  the  marks  of  royalty,  bis  colour  that  of  the  blue  lotus 
and  alluring  as  the  God  of  Love  himself. 

Beholding  that  hero,  the  equal  of  Indra,  the  Rakshasi  was 
overwhelmed  with  desire.  Rama  was  handsome,  she  hideous ; 
his  waist  was  slender,  hers  thick  and  heavy ;  he  had  large  eyes, 
hers  squinted;  his  locks  were  beautiful,  hers  were  red;  his 
whole  appearance  was  pleasing,  hers  repellent.  Rama's  voice 
was  sonorous,  hers  strident ;  he  was  fair  and  youthful,  she  old 
and  haggard ;  he  was  amiable,  she  sullen ;  he  was  self- 
controlled,  she  unruly ;  he  was  captivating,  she  odious. 

Consumed  with  passion,  the  Rakshasi  said  to  Rama : — 

"  With  thy  matted  locks  and  ascetic  guise,  bearing  bow  and 
arrows,  why  hast  thou,  accompanied  by  thy  consort,  come  to 
these  woods,  which  are  frequented  by  demons  ?  What  is  the 
purpose  of  thy  journey  ?  " 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  Rakshasi,  Shurpanakha,  that  hero, 
the  Scourge  of  his  Foes,  with  perfect  candour  began  to  relate  all. 

He  said : — "  There  was  a  king  named  Dasaratha,  who  was 
as  powerful  as  a  God.  I  am  his  eldest  son,  known  among  men 
as  Rama ;  this  is  my  younger  brother,  Lakshmana,  my  faithful 
companion,  and  this,  my  consort,  the  illustrious  Sita,  daughter 
of  the  King  of  Videha. 

"  Bound  by  the  will  of  my  sire  and  in  order  to  carry  out 
my  duty,  I  have  come  to  dwell  in  the  forest. 

"  But  now  I  wish  to  know  who  thy  father  is,  who  thou  art, 
and  what  thy  race  ?  To  judge  by  thy  charms,  thou  art  a 
Rakshasi !   Tell  me  truly,  what  has  brought  thee  hither  ?  " 

Hearing  the  words  of  Rama,  the  Rakshasi,  tormented  by 
tiie  pangs  of  love,  answered : — 
39 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Hear  O  Rama  and  I  will  tell  thee  the  truth !  I  am 
Shurpanakha,  a  Rakshasi,  who  can  change  her  form  at  will. 
I  wander  about  in  the  forest,  striking  terror  in  the  hearts  of 
all  beings.  My  brothers  are  Ravana,  of  whom  thou  hast 
doubtless  heard,  and  the  powerful  and  somnolent  Kumbha- 
karna,  the  virtuous  Bibishana  a  stranger  to  our  practices,  and 
two  others  famed  for  their  martial  qualities,  Khara  and  Dushana. 

"  I,  who  am  more  powerful  than  they,  having  seen  thee, 
O  Rama,  wish  to  unite  myself  with  thee,  O  Lord,  O  First 
of  Men  1 

"  I  am  endowed  with  power  and  able  to  range  at  will  by 
thought  alone ;  therefore  do  thou  become  my  master.  What 
is  Sita  to  thee  ? 

"  Deformed,  without  beauty,  she  is  not  worthy  of  thee, 
whereas  I  should  prove  a  well-matched  partner,  my  beauty 
equal  to  thine  own ;  do  thou  look  on  me  as  thy  consort.  This 
unsightly,  grim-visaged  human  female,  of  lean  abdomen,  will 
be  devoured  by  me  this  day  in  thy  presence,  together  with  that 
brother  of  thine. 

"  Thou  and  I  shall  wander  on  the  summit  of  the  mountains 
and  through  the  forests  together,  exploring  the  whole  region 
of  Dandaka,  according  to  thy  whim." 

Speaking  thus,  the  Rakshasi  threw  impassioned  glances  at 
Rama,  who,  smiling,  made  the  following  astute  reply. 


CHAPTER    i  S 

The  Mutilation  of  Shurpanakha 

Smiling  a  little,  Rama,  in  gently  mocking  tones,  answered 
Shurpanakha,  who  had  been  caught  in  the  noose  of  love, 
saying:— 

"  I  am  already  wedded  and  this  is  my  beloved  consort ;  the 
rivalry  between  co-wives  would  prove  unbearable !  My 
younger  brother  however  who  is  of  a  happy  disposition,  of 
agreeable  appearance,  virtuous  and  chaste,  is  called  Lakshmana 
and  is  full  of  vigour.  He  has  not  yet  experienced  the  joys  of 
40 


ARANYA  KANDA 
a  wife's  company  and  desires  a  consort.  He  is  youthful  and 
attractive  and  would  therefore  be  a  fitting  husband  for  thee. 
Take  my  brother  as  thy  lord,  O  Lady  of  large  eyes  and  lovely 
hips,  and  enjoy  him  without  a  rival,  as  Mount  Mem,  the 
sunlight." 

Hearing  these  words,  the  Rakshasi,  blinded  by  passion, 
leaving  Rama,  at  once  addressed  Lakshmana,  saying : — 

"  My  beauty  renders  me  a  worthy  wife  for  thee ;  therefore 
come  and  we  will  range  the  Dandaka  Forest  and  mountains 
happily  together." 

Thus  accosted  by  the  Rakshasi  Shurpanakha,  Lakshmana, 
the  son  of  Sumitra,  skilled  in  discourse,  smiling,  gave  this 
ingenious  reply : — 

"  How  canst  thou  wish  to  become  the  wife  of  a  slave,  such 
as  I  ?  I  am  wholly  dependent  on  my  noble  brother,  O  Thou 
whose  complexion  resembles  the  lotus,  who  art  pleasing  to 
look  upon  and  chaste  ?  O  Lady  of  large  eyes,  thou  art  a  paragon, 
do  thou  become  the  consort  of  that  matchless  hero.  Re- 
nouncing that  ugly,  evil  and  peevish  old  woman,  whose  limbs 
are  deformed,  he  will  certainly  devote  himself  to  thee !  O 
Lady  of  ravishing  complexion  and  lovely  limbs,  what  sensible 
man  would  sacrifice  that  unrivalled  beauty  of  thine  for  an 
ordinary  woman  ?  " 

Thinking  Lakshmana's  words  to  be  sincere  and  not  under- 
standing his  jest,  that  cruel  and  misshapen  Rakshasi,  in  the 
blindness  of  her  passion  once  more  addressed  Rama,  the 
Scourge  of  His  Foes,  who  was  seated  in  the  leaf-thatched  hut 
with  Sita,  and  said : — 

"  Is  it  for  this  hideous,  evil  and  peevish  woman,  who  is  old 
and  deformed,  that  thou  dost  slight  me  ? 

"  I  shall  devour  her  in  thy  presence  to-day,  and  shall  live 
happily  with  thee  without  a  rival." 

Speaking  thus,  the  Rakshasi,  whose  eyes  blazed  like  torches, 
hurled  herself  in  fury  on  Sita,  like  a  great  meteor  descending 
on  the  planet  Rohini. 

Then  the  mighty  Rama  restrained  her,  as,  like  the  noose  of 
death,  she  advanced  towards  Sita,  and  in  anger  addressed 
Lakshmana,  saying : — 

"  It  is  unwise  to  taunt  those  beings  who  are  vile  and  cruel, 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

O  Saumitri.  Take  heed,  see,  Vaidehi  is  in  danger,  O  Friend  ! 
Do  thou  maim  this  hideous  demon  of  protruding  belly,  who  is 
evil  and  filled  with  fury." 

The  valiant  Lakshmana,  highly  incensed  against  the  Rakshasi, 
thereupon  drew  his  sword  from  its  scabbard  and,  in  the  presence 
of  Rama,  cut  off  her  ears  and  nose. 

Her  ears  and  nose  severed,  Shurpanakha  uttered  a  terrible 
cry  and  ran  into  the  forest.  Being  mutilated,  the  Rakshasi, 
streaming  with  blood,  created  a  terrible  uproar,  like  a  tempest 
in  the  rainy  season  and,  dripping  with  blood,  that  hideous 
monster,  lifting  up  her  arms,  plunged  howling  into  the  deep 
woods. 

Thereafter  the  injured  Shurpanakha  sought  out  her  brother 
Khara  of  great  might,  who,  surrounded  by  a  troop  of  demons, 
was  seated  in  Janastnana  and  threw  herself  on  the  ground 
before  him,  like  a  meteorite  falling  from  heaven. 

Wild  with  terror  and  covered  with  blood,  Khara's  sister, 
almost  deprived  of  her  senses,  related  everything  concerning 
Raghava's  arrival  in  the  forest  with  his  consort  and  Lakshmana 
and  the  circumstances  of  her  disfigurement. 


CHAPTER     19 

Shurpanaka  tells  her  brother  Khara  of  her  disfigurement 

Seeing  his  sister  lying  on  the  ground,  mutilated  and  streaming 
with  blood,  the  demon,  inflamed  with  anger,  said  to  her  : — 

"Rise!  Tell  me  why  thou  art  distraught;  master  thy 
terror  and  narrate  lucidly,  who  has  disfigured  thee  in  this 
fashion.  Who  has  dared  to  touch  a  black  and  venomous 
serpent,  stretched  peacefully  beside  him,  with  his  foot  ?  That 
fool  who  has  thus  dealt  with  thee,  is  unaware  that  this  day  he 
has  swallowed  a  virulent  poison  and  placed  the  noose  of  death 
round  his  neck. 

"  Who  has  brought  thee  to  this  state,  thou  who  art  imbued 
with  energy  and  courage,  who  art  able  to  range  everywhere 
at  will,  the  rival  of  Antaka  himself?   How  is  it  that  thou  art 


ARANYA    KANDA 

found  in  this  sorry  plight?  Amongst  Gods,  Gandharvas, 
mighty  Sages  and  other  Beings,  who  is  sufficiently  powerful  to 
have  disfigured  thee  ?  I  know  of  none  in  all  the  worlds  who 
would  dare  to  provoke  me,  save  it  be  Mahendra,  He  of  the 
Thousand  Eyes,  who  overcame  the  demon  Paka.  To-day  I 
shall  exact  the  life  of  thy  traducer  with  my  death-dealing 
arrows,  as  swans  suck  out  the  milky  substance  that  floats  on 
the  water. 

"  Struck  down  in  the  fight,  mortally  wounded  by  my  shafts, 
whose  foaming  blood  will  the  earth  drink  to-day?  Whose 
limbs  will  the  vultures,  drawn  by  my  summons,  tear  apart  and 
devour  with  delight  when  they  fall  under  my  blows  in  combat  ? 

"  Neither  the  Gods  nor  the  Gandharvas  nor  the  Pisachas  nor 
the  Rakshasas  shall  be  able  to  save  that  wretch  from  my  grasp, 
in  that  fierce  encounter. 

"  Compose  thyself  and  in  tranquillity,  tell  me  who  that 
miscreant  is  and  who,  abusing  his  power,  has  ill-treated  thee 
thus  ?  " 

Having  listened  to  her  brother's  words,  Shurpanakha,  beside 
herself  with  rage,  answered  weeping : — 

"  They  are  two  most  handsome  and  powerful  youths,  with 
large  eyes  resembling  lotuses,  clad  in  bark  and  black  antelope 
skins,  living  on  fruit  and  roots,  their  senses  under  control, 
practising  penance  and  the  brahmacharya  vow,  the  sons  of 
King  Dasaratha,  two  brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  who  bear 
the  marks  of  royalty  and  resemble  the  King  of  the  Gandharvas. 
I  am  unable  to  say  if  they  be  human  beings  or  Gods.  Between 
them,  I  saw  a  young  and  beautiful  damsel  of  slender  waist, 
adorned  with  many  kinds  of  jewels,  and  it  is  on  account  of  this 
youthful  woman  that  I  am  reduced  to  this  plight,  like  one 
uncared  for  and  set  at  naught  on  account  of  her  infidelity.  I 
wish  to  drink  the  blood  of  this  woman  and  those  two  youths  on 
the  battlefield." 

Hearing  his  sister  utter  these  words,  Khara,  mad  with  anger, 
called  on  fourteen  demons  of  great  strength,  equal  to  Antaka 
himself,  and  said  to  them : — 

"  Two  men  furnished  with  weapons,  clad  in  bark  and  black 
antelope  skins,  have  ventured  into  the  inaccessible  Dandaka 
Forest  in  company  with  a  youthful  woman ;  do  ye  slay  them 
43

and  also  that  wretch  herself.  My  sister  desires  to  drink  their 
blood !  O  Ye  Rakshasas,  this  is  my  sister's  dearest  wish, 
go  therefore  with  all  speed  and  in  your  great  might  destroy 
them.  On  seeing  the  two  brothers  struck  down  by  your  blows, 
my  sister  will  drink  their  blood  on  the  field,  with  joy." 

Receiving  this  command,  the  fourteen  demons  swiftly 
departed,  accompanied  by  Shurpanakha,  like  clouds  driven 
before  the  wind.

Rama  slays  the  Demons  sent  by  Kkara 

The  cruel  Shurpanakha,  having  reached  Raghava's  hermitage, 
pointed  out  the  two  brothers  and  Sita  to  the  demons,  and 
they  beheld  Rama,  full  of  valour,  seated  in  his  hut  of  leaves, 
in  company  with  Sita,  attended  on  by  Lakshmana. 

Seeing  Shurpanakha  and  the  demons  who  accompanied  her, 
the  illustrious  descendant  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  Rama,  said 
to  Lakshmana  who  was  burning  with  courage : — 

"  Stay  a  moment  with  Sita,  O  Saumitri,  so  that  I  may  slay 
these  demons  who  have  followed  the  Rakshasi." 

Hearing  the  words  of  Rama,  versed  in  knowledge  of  the 
Self,  that  prudent  offshoot  of  the  House  of  Raghu  answered 
with  deference,  saying  :   "  Be  it  so." 

Then  the  righteous  Raghava,  stretching  his  great  bow,  inlaid 
with  gold,  addressed  those  demons,  saying : — 

"  We  are  the  sons  of  Dasaratha,  two  brothers,  Rama  and 
Lakshmana,  who  have  come  with  Sita  to  the  inaccessible 
Dandaka  Forest.  Living  on  roots  and  fruit,  with  our. senses 
under  control,  we  practice  penance  and  the  brahmacharya  vow 
and  pass  our  days  in  the  woods.  Why  do  you  seek  to  do  us 
injury,  wretches  that  you  are  ?  It  is  at  the  request  of  the  Sages, 
that  I  have  come  hither  to  castigate  you  for  your  evil  deeds 
on  the  field  of  battle.  Halt  where  you  stand  and  advance  no 
further !  If  you  desire  to  live,  turn  back,  O  Prowlers  of  the 
Night." 

44 


ARANYA    KANDA 

At  these  words,  those  slayers  of  brahmins,  the  fourteen 
demons,  bearing  spears  in  their  hands,  inflamed  with  anger, 
their  eyes  red,  terrible  to  behold,  filled  with  a  fierce  exultation, 
answered  Rama,  whose  fiery  glances  and  sweet  speech  mani- 
fested a  courage  they  had  not  seen  till  that  hour,  and  said : — 

"  For  having  incurred  the  displeasure  of  our  master,  the 
most  magnanimous  Khara,  thou  art  about  to  fall  under  our 
blows  in  battle.  What  power  hast  thou  single-handed  to 
slay  so  many  in  the  field ;  it  is  thou  who  shalt  lose  thy  life  to-day 
in  this  conflict.  Our  arms  bearing  maces,  spears  and  darts 
will  rob  thee  of  thy  strength,  and  thy  bow  shall  fall  from 
thy  hand." 

Thus  speaking,  the  fourteen  demons,  brandishing  their 
formidable  weapons,  hurled  themselves  on  Rama,  letting  fly 
their  spears  at  the  invincible  Raghava,  but  Kakutstha  with  as 
many  arrows  tipped  with  gold  cut  off  those  fourteen  spears. 
And  that  illustrious  warrior,  full  of  wrath,  taking  out  more 
arrows,  which  had  been  sharpened  on  stone,  seized  his  bow 
and  placing  them  on  the  string,  made  the  titans  his  target. 

Then  Raghava,  loosing  those  shafts,  as  Indra  his  thunderbolt, 
speedily  pierced  the  breasts  of  those  demons,  and  the  arrows, 
all  bloody,  penetrated  the  earth  like  serpents  disappearing  into 
an  ant  heap. 

With  their  breasts  pierced  by  those  arrows,  the  demons  fell 
to  the  ground,  like  trees,  whose  trunks  have  been  severed. 

Bathed  in  blood,  mutilated,  bereft  of  life,  they  lay  stretched 
on  the  earth,  and  Shurpanakha,  seeing  them  thus,  blind  with 
rage,  sped  away,  to  seek  out  her  brother  Khara. 

Wounded  afresh,  the  blood  coagulating  like  a  tree  exuding 
resin,  Shurpanakha  fell  down  before  her  brother  and  in  his 
presence  set  up  a  mighty  uproar,  wailing  and  shrieking,  raining 
tears,  her  features  distorted. 

Having  seen  the  demons  fall  on  the  field  of  battle,  Shur- 
panakha, returning  in  all  haste  to  her  brother  Khara,  described 
their  deaths  to  him  in  every  detail.

CHAPTER    21 

Shurpanakha  urges  Khar  a  to  fight  Rama 

Seeing  Shurpanakha  beside  herself,  lying  on  the  ground, 
having  returned  without  accomplishing  her  design,  Khara 
addressed  her  in  harsh  tones,  saying  : — 

"  Have  I  not  placed  those  valiant  demons,  living  on  flesh 
at  thy  disposal,  for  thy  pleasure  ?  Why  dost  thou  still  com- 
plain ?  They  are  zealous,  loyal  and  have  ever  been  my  trusted 
servants.  Though  invincible,  even  had  they  to  die,  they 
would  not  disobey  me.  What  is  this  ?  I  wish  to  know  the 
reason  why  thou  art  rolling  on  the  earth  like  a  serpent,  crying 
*  O,  my  Lord '.  Why,  since  I  am  thy  protector,  dost  thou 
lament  like  one  abandoned  ?  Rise,  rise  !  Let  us  nave  no  more 
of  these  tears  and  swoonings." 

Thus  did  Khara,  her  brother,  speak  to  that  terrible  Rakshasi 
to  comfort  her,  and  she,  wiping  away  her  tears,  said : — 

"  When  I  came  hither  with  my  nose  and  ears  severed,  drenched 
in  blood,  which  flowed  forth  like  a  river,  thou  didst  console  me. 
To  please  me,  thou  didst  command  fourteen  valiant  demons 
to  sky  the  ruthless  Rama  and  Lakshmana.  These  demons, 
incensed  against  Rama,  armed  with  spears  and  pikes,  have 
fallen  victims  to  his  murderous  arrows,  in  combat.  Witnessing 
those  skilled  warriors,  felled  to  the  ground  in  an  instant  and 
Rama's  great  exploit,  I  am  filled  with  extreme  fear. 

"  Trembling  in  every  limb,  terrified  and  beside  myself,  I 
take  refuge  in  thee  once  more,  O  Prowler  of  the  Night,  seeing 
cause  for  apprehension  on  every  side.  Submerged  as  I  am  in 
the  infinite  ocean  of  distress,  haunted  by  the  crocodiles  of 
affliction  and  the  billows  of  fear,  wilt  thou  not  rescue  me  ? 
Under  Rama's  fiery  arrows,  the  demons,  eaters  of  flesh,  who 
followed  me,  are  lying  on  the  ground. 

"  If  thou  hast  any  pity  for  me  and  for  these  demons,  if  thou 
art  possessed  of  the  courage  and  strength  to  meet  Rama  in 
46 


ARANYA    KANDA 

battle,  then,  O  Prowler  of  the  Night,  slay  this  thorn  in  the  side 
of  the  demons,  who  has  set  up  his  hermitage  in  the  Dandaka 
Forest. 

"  If  thou  dost  not  bring  about  the  death  of  Rama,  the 
Slayer  of  his  Foes,  this  very  day,  I  shall  yield  up  my  life  in 
thy  presence,  dishonoured.  I  see  clearly,  that  even  supported 
by  thy  forces,  thou  art  not  able  to  meet  Rama  in  pitched  battle. 

"  Thou  deemest  thyself  to  be  a  great  hero,  but  thou  art 
not  really  so,  thy  prowess  exists  only  in  thine  own  conceited 
imaginings;  therefore  do  thou  leave  Janasthana,  in  all  haste, 
with  thy  companions,  O  Stigma  of  Thy  Race !  Do  thou  return 
victor  in  the  struggle,  for,  if  thou  hast  neither  the  strength, 
nor  the  valour  to  slay  these  two  men,  how  canst  thou  remain 
here? 

"  Defeated  by  Rama's  prowess,  thou  wilt  surely  die,  for  he 
is  truly  brave,  that  son  of  Dasaratha,  Rama,  and  his  brother 
also,  who  disfigured  me  is  supremely  valiant !  " 

Thus,  in  the  presence  of  her  brother,  did  that  Rakshasi 
lament  again  and  again,  beating  her  breast  and,  overcome  with 
mortification,  lost  consciousness.  Then,  after  a  space  coming 
to  her  senses,  exercised  with  grief,  she  continued  to  cry  out 
and  strike  her  breast  with  her  hands. 


CHAPTER     22 

Khara  and  his  fourteen  thousand  Demons  march  against  Rama 

Listening  to  Shurpanakha's  reproaches,  Khara,  burning  with 
anger,  seated  amidst  his  warriors,  answered  fiercely : — 

"  Thy  contempt  incites  me  to  ungovernable  fury,  I  am 
beside  myself  and  can  no  more  endure  this  than  it  is  possible 
to  support  salt  poured  into  a  wound.  I  hold  Rama  to  be  of 
no  account  and  regard  him  as  already  dead.  His  offence  will 
bring  about  his  end  this  day ;  therefore  restrain  thy  tears, 
do  not  distress  thyself  further.  I  shall  despatch  Rama  and 
his  brother  to  the  region  of  death,  and  thou,  O  Rakshasi, 
47 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

shalt  to-day  drink  the  warm  blood  of  that  one  of  evil  deeds 
struck  down  by  mine  axe." 

Overjoyed  on  hearing  these  words,  falling  from  her  brother's 
lips,  Shurpanakha,  in  her  folly,  began  to  praise  Khara,  the 
Foremost  of  Titans. 

First  condemned,  then  extolled  by  her,  Khara  called  on 
Dushana,  the  commander  of  his  army,  saying  : — 
"  O  Friend,  make  ready  fourteen  thousand  trained  titans 
who  are  obedient  to  my  commands,  full  of  martial  ardour, 
who  never  retreat  in  battle,  who  resemble  thunder  clouds  and 
who  revel  in  cruelty  and  delight  in  slaying  men. 

"  Do  thou,  with  all  speed,  bring  my  chariot  also,  with  bows, 
arrows,  glittering  swords,  darts  and  javelins,  that  have  been 
well  sharpened.  I  wish  to  place  myself  at  the  head  of  those 
magnanimous  titans,  in  order  to  slay  the  haughty  Rama,  O 
Skilful  Warrior ! " 

As  he  was  speaking,  Dushana  harnessed  excellent  horses 
to  the  great  car,  that  shone  like  the  sun,  whereupon  Khara 
ascended  the  chariot  resembling  the  peak  of  Meru,  that  was 
vast,  inlaid  with  pure  gold,  with  golden  wheels  and  shafts  set 
with  emeralds.  Decorated  with  symbols  of  good  fortune, 
such  as  fish,  flowers,  trees,  rocks,  mountains,  birds  and  stars, 
it  was  furnished  with  banners  and  spears,  hung  with  delightful 
bells  and  yoked  to  excellent  steeds. 

Then  Khara,  chafing  with  impatience,  as  also  Dushana, 
seeing  that  great  host,  furnished  with  chariots,  shields,  weapons 
and  banners,  cried  to  that  multitude  of  demons : — "Advance  !  " 

Thereafter  that  mighty  titan  army,  numbering  fourteen 
thousand,  equipped  with  formidable  shields,  weapons  and 
banners,  rushed  out  impetuously,  amidst  a  great  tumult. 

Armed  with  hammers,  picks,  spears,  sharp  axes,  sabres, 
discus  and  shining  javelins,  as  well  as  darts,  formidable  clubs, 
immense  bows,  goads,  swords,  maces  and  thunderbolts,  terrible 
to  look  upon,  those  ferocious  titans,  obedient  to  the  commands 
of  Khara,  left  Janasthana,  and  he,  withdrawing  himself  a  little, 
reviewed  those  titans  of  malignant  aspect,  who  were  rushing 
forth,  and  thereafter  followed  them. 

Obedient  to  Khara's  command,  the  charioteer  mounted  on 
the  car  of  that  Slayer  of  His  Foes,  spurring  on  his  dappled 
48 


ARANYA    KANDA 

steeds,  whose  harness  was  wrought  with  pure  gold,  advanced 
with  all  speed,  causing  the  cardinal  points  and  other  regions 
to  ring  with  the  sound. 

And  Khara,  in  harsh  tones,  inflamed  with  anger,  chafing 
with  the  desire  to  destroy  his  adversary,  endowed  with  great 
strength,  equal  to  Antaka,  urged  on  his  charioteer  again  and 
again,  roaring  like  a  great  cloud  about  to  let  loose  a  stream 
of  hail. 


chapter    23 

The  Titan  Army  advances  amid  evil  Portents 

At  that  time  terrible  portents  appeared  and  from  a  dark  cloud 
a  shower  of  blood  fell.  The  swift-footed  steeds  yoked  to 
Khara's  chariot,  stumbled  on  the  level  road  of  the  royal  high- 
way, strewn  with  flowers ;  the  sun  was  covered  with  a  black 
disc,  edged,  as  it  were  with  blood,  like  a  circle  of  burning 
coals,  whilst  a  frightful  vulture  settled  on  the  standard  with 
its  golden  support. 

Birds  and  beasts  of  prey,  roaming  in  the  vicinity  of  Janasthana, 
emitted  deafening  cries,  creating  an  appalling  clamour,  and  near 
that  region,  terrible  jackals  gave  forth  fearful  and  blood- 
curdling howls,  like  fiends. 

Immense  and  formidable  thunderclouds  resembling  elephants 
with  crushed  Temples,  showered  down  a  rain  of  blood,  which  hid 
the  entire  firmament ;  a  great  darkness  fell,  causing  the  hair 
to  stand  on  end,  obscuring  the  four  quarters.  Dusk  arrived 
before  the  appointed  time,  assuming  a  sanguinous  hue  and,  as 
Khara  proceeded,  wild  beasts  and  birds  of  terrifying  aspect 
barred  his  path,  whilst  herons,  hyenas  and  vultures  raised  a 
ghastly  clamour. 

Hideous  jackals,  a  sign  of  misfortune  in  war,  howled  at 
the  approaching  army,  flames  darting  from  their  jaws  and  a 
headless  trunk,  resembling  a  club,  was  seen  close  to  the  sun. 
Though  the  time  of  eclipse  had  not  come,  yet  that  golden  orb 
was  seized  by  the  planet  Swarbhanu ;  the  winds  blew  violently 
49 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  the  sun  was  bereft  of  lustre ;  though  not  yet  night,  stars 
thick  as  fireflies  appeared. 

Birds  and  fishes  dived  into  the  depths  of  the  lakes,  on  which 
the  lotuses  had  withered,  and  in  that  hour  the  trees  were 
bereft  of  flowers  and  fruit,  and  sombre  dust-clouds  arose 
without  the  stirring  of  the  wind.  Parrots  called  wildly 
*  Chichikuchi  *  and  comets  of  sinister  aspect  fell  without  a 
sound;  the  earth  with  her  mountains,  woods  and  forests, 
shook. 

As  Khara,  standing  in  his  chariot,  was  raising  his  war-cry,  his 
left  arm  twitched  and  his  voice  died  away ;  glancing  round  on 
every  side,  his  eyes  were  suffused  with  tears,  his  head  throbbed, 
yet  in  his  folly  he  did  not  turn  back. 

Witnessing  these  evil  portents  that  caused  his  hair  to  stand 
on  end,  with  a  defiant  laugh,  Khara  addressed  that  host  of 
titans  saying : — 

"  I  hold  these  terrible  portents,  dreadful  to  behold,  as 
nought  compared  with  my  power  and  disregard  them  as  do 
the  strong,  the  weak !  I  am  able  to  shoot  down  the  stars  from 
heaven  with  my  sharp  arrows  !  I  can  subjugate  the  empire  of 
death  itself !  Till  by  means  of  my  powerful  weapons,  I  have 
brought  Rama  low,  who  depends  on  his  strength  alone,  as 
also  Lakshmana,  I  shall  not  turn  back.  May  my  sister,  for 
whose  sake  I  have  sworn  to  bring  about  the  death  of  Rama 
and  Lakshmana,  drink  the  blood  of  these  two.  Till  this  hour, 
I  have  not  known  defeat  on  the  field  of  battle  ;  ye  are  witness 
to  it,  I  do  not  utter  falsehood !  In  my  wrath  X  am  able  to  slay 
the  Chief  of  the  Gods  bearing  the  thunderbolt,  mounted  on  the 
intoxicated  Airavata,  how  much  more  am  I  able  to  slay  these 
two  mortals  ?  " 

Hearing  those  boastful  words,  the  vast  army  of  the  titans, 
whom  death  already  held  in  his  noose,  was  filled  with  incom- 
parable joy,  and  advanced  full  of  vigour,  anxious  to  join  issue 
in  battle. 

Thereupon,  the  high-souled  Rishis,  Devas,  Gandharvas  and 
Charanas  assembled  and  those  virtuous  beings  said  one  to 
the  other : — 

"  Reverence  to  the  cows,  the  brahmins  and  all  those  who 
have  acquired  spiritual  merit  in  the  world ! 
50 


ARANYA    KANDA 

"  As  Vishnu,  bearing  the  discus  in  his  hand,  subdued  the 
Asuras,  so  may  Rama  too  triumph  over  the  titans  in  this  fight." 

Repeatedly  expressing  this  wish  and  many  others,  those 
illustrious  Rishis  and  the  Gods,  stationed  in  the  sky,  gazed 
down  on  the  army  of  the  titans,  that  was  about  to  be  destroyed. 

Then  Khara  in  his  swiftly-moving  chariot  rode  out  to  the 
head  of  his  army  and  those  twelve  of  exceeding  prowess: 
Karaviraksha,  Parusha,  Kalakarmukha,  Hemamalin,  Mahamalin, 
Sarpasya,  Shyengamin,  Prithugriva,  Vajnashatru,  Vihangama, 
Dirjaya,  Krudhirashana,  surrounded  him,  and  Mahakapala, 
Sthulaksha,  Pramatha  and  Trishiras,  these  four  followed 
Dushana. 

As  a  group  of  planets  rush  towards  the  sun  or  moon,  so  in 
their  eagerness  to  enter  the  fight  did  that  formidable  army  of 
of  titans  hurl  themselves  with  tremendous  impetus  on  the 
two  princes. 


CHAPTER     24 

The  Combat  opens  between  Rama  and  the  Titans 

When  Khara  of  great  prowess  advanced  on  Rama's  hermitage, 
the  two  princes  observed  many  dreadful  portents,  and  Rama, 
deeply  moved,  said  to  Lakshmana  : — "  O  Mighty-armed  One, 
these  inauspicious  omens,  causing  terror  to  all  beings,  foretell 
the  destruction  of  the  demon  hosts. 

"  Yonder  dun-coloured  clouds,  resembling  asses'  skin,  pass 
across  the  sky,  raining  blood  in  dreadful  convulsions.  Behold, 
0  Lakshmana,  smoke  rising  from  mine  arrows,  as  if  they 
rejoiced  at  the  coming  contest,  and  my  bow  of  beaten  gold 
moving  of  itself,  eager  for  action.  Meseems  the  cry  of  wild 
birds  that  frequent  the  woods  foretells  danger,  nay,  that  the 
very  lives  of  our  foes  are  in  jeopardy.  Assuredly  a  great  battle 
will  shortly  take  place ;  the  twitching  of  my  left  arm  betokens  it. 
O  Hero,  for  us  victory  is  imminent,  and  the  defeat  of  the 
titans  assured.    Thy  countenance  is  resplendent  and  exultant, 

51  E 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

O  Lakshmana !    Those  warriors  who  enter  into  combat  with 
a  rueful  mien  are  lost. 

"  I  hear  the  roar  of  those  titans  of  cruel  deeds  and  the  sound 
of  their  drums.  If  a  prudent  man  desires  success  and  wishes 
to  escape  defeat,  he  should  be  forearmed  against  the  future. 
Therefore,  bearing  thy  bow  and  arrows,  taking  Sita  with  thee, 
repair  to  a  mountain  cave,  screened  by  trees  and  difficult  of 
access.  O  Lakshmana,  do  not  oppose  my  commands,  but, 
swearing  obedience  to  my  feet,  go  thither,  O  Friend,  without 
delay.  Thou  art  valiant  and  well  able  to  strike  down  the 
titans,  but  I  desire  to  slay  these  Prowlers  of  the  Night  single- 
handed." 

Having  spoken  thus,  Lakshmana,  taking  up  his  bow  and 
arrows,  withdrew  with  Sita  to  an  inaccessible  cave. 

As  Lakshmana  entered  the  cavern  with  Sita,  Rama  rejoiced 
at  his  brother's  submission  and  donned  his  coat  of  mail. 

Clothed  in  armour  that  shone  like  fire,  Rama  resembled  a 
mighty  flame  illumining  the  darkness,  and  that  hero,  standing 
erect,  took  up  his  bow  and  arrows  and,  by  the  twanging  of 
the  cord,  caused  the  four  cardinal  points  to  re-echo. 

Then  the  Gods,  Gandharvas,  Siddhas  and  Charanas  gathered 
together  to  witness  the  struggle  and  the  great-souled  Rishis 
began  to  converse  one  with  the  other,  saying : — 

"  May  it  be  well  with  all  the  cows  and  brahmins  found  on 
the  earth  !  May  Raghava  overcome  the  descendants  of 
Foulastya  in  combat !  May  he  be  as  victorious  as  Vishnu,  who 
with  his  discus  routed  the  foremost  of  the  asuras !  " 

Having  spoken  thus,  exchanging  glances,  they  added : — 
"  But  how  can  Rama  overcome  those  fourteen  thousand 
demons  of  fearful  deeds  single-handed  ?  " 

Thereafter  those  Rajarishis  and  Siddhas,  stationed  in  their 
aerial  chariots,  were  moved  with  curiosity  as  to  the  outcome 
of  the  conflict  and  seeing  Rama,  splendidly  accoutred,  standing 
alone  on  the  field  of  battle,  all  those  beings  were  filled  with 
apprehension ;  the  peerless  Rama,  however,  the  doer  of  noble 
deeds,  assumed  the  aspect  of  that  high-souled  and  avenging 
God,  Rudra ! 

Whilst   the    Gods,    Gandharvas   and    Charanas    were    still 
conversing,  the  army  of  the  titans,  creating  a  fearful  clamour, 
52 


ARANYA    KANDA 

clad  in  mail,  bearing  weapons  and  banners,  appeared  on  every 
side. 

Uttering  loud  battle  cries,  josding  one  another,  twanging 
their  bowstrings,  opening  their  jaws  wide,  they  shouted : — 
"  We  will  destroy  the  enemy  !  "  This  appalling  tumult  filled 
the  forest  and  struck  terror  into  the  hearts  of  its  denizens, 
who  fled  from  the  sound,  not  daring  to  look  back. 

Then  the  demon  army,  resembling  a  stormy  sea,  brandishing 
every  kind  of  weapon,  rapidly  approached  Rama,  but  he,  an 
experienced  warrior,  looking  round  on  every  side,  saw  that 
army  of  Khara's  advancing  and  went  out  to  meet  it,  taking 
his  arrows  from  their  quiver  and  stretching  his  dread  bow, 
letting  forth  a  piercing  shout  presaging  the  death  of  the  titans. 

Dreadful  to  behold  in  his  wrath,  he  resembled  the  lire  at  the 
dissolution  of  the  world  and  seeing  him  filled  with  energy  the 
forest  deities  fled  away.  In  his  anger,  Rama  resembled  the 
Bearer  of  the  Pinaka  bow  intent  on  destroying  Daksha's 
sacrifice. 

With  their  bows  and  weapons,  their  cars  and  their  armour, 
which  shone  like  fire,  the  hosts  of  those  eaters  of  human  flesh 
resembled  a  mass  of  dark  clouds  at  the  hour  of  sunrise. 


chapter  25 

The  Combat  between  Rama  and  the  Titans  continues 

Approaching  the  hermitage,  Khara,  in  company  with  those 
who  preceded  him,  beheld  Rama,  the  Destroyer  of  his  Foes, 
full  of  wrath,  armed  with  his  bow  and  seeing  that  mighty 
warrior,  bow  in  hand,  Khara  ordered  his  charioteer  to  drive 
upon  him  with  his  car. 

Thus  commanded,  Suta  drove  his  horses  to  where  the 
illustrious  Rama,  wielding  his  bow,  stood  unmoved. 

Beholding  Khara  advancing  on  Rama,  the  titans,  uttering 
loud  shouts,  surrounded  him  on  all  sides,  and  he,  stationed 
53 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

in  his  chariot  amidst  those  Yatudhanas,  resembled  the  planet 
Mars  encircled  by  stars. 

Loosing  a  thousand  shafts,  Khara  emitted  a  tremendous  war- 
cry  and  all  the  demons  in  fury  showered  various  missiles  on 
that  invincible  archer  Rama,  striking  him  in  their  frenzy  with 
iron  clubs,  swords,  spears  and  axes. 

With  their  colossal  stature  and  extraordinary  power,  they 
resembled  mountains  as  they  bore  down  on  Kakutstha  with 
their  chariots  and  horses. 

In  their  desire  to  overcome  Rama,  those  demon  hordes, 
mounted  on  elephants  as  high  as  the  peaks  of  mountains, 
covered  him  with  a  hail  of  weapons,  like  great  clouds  letting 
loose  their  rain  on  the  King  of  Mountains,  and  Raghava  was 
hemmed  in  on  all  sides  by  those  ferocious  looking  demons. 

As  at  evening  time  Mahadeva  is  surrounded  by  his  satellites, 
so  was  Rama  beset  by  the  lances  of  the  titans,  but  that  prince 
received  the  missiles  hurled  against  him  as  the  sea  receives  the 
rivers  that  empty  themselves  therein.  As  the  Himalayas 
remain  unmoved,  when  struck  by  lightning,  so  did  he,  when 
those  dreadful  weapons  tore  his  flesh.  Pierced  in  every  limb, 
the  blood  gushing  forth  on  all  sides,  he  resembled  the  evening 
sun  enveloped  in  cloud. 

Beholding  Rama  encircled  by  thousands  of  titans,  the  Gods 
and  sages  were  profoundly  moved,  but  he,  growing  enraged, 
bending  his  bow  like  a  sickle,  let  loose  hundreds  and  thousands 
of  pointed  shafts,  that  could  not  be  intercepted  and  carried 
death  to  those  they  pierced.  As  if  in  sport,  on  the  battlefield 
Rama  let  fly  countless  arrows  furnished  with  herons  plumes, 
tipped  with  gold,  destroying  innumerable  titans  like  the  noose 
of  death  itself. 

Unconcernedly  loosed  by  Rama,  those  arrows  passed  through 
the  demons'  bodies  and,  stained  with  blood,  flew  through  the 
air  like  blazing  torches.  Countless  shafts  drawn  from  Rama's 
quiver  fell  in  hundreds  and  thousands,  robbing  the  demons 
of  their  life's  breath,  their  bows,  their  banners,  their  shields  and 
their  armour,  their  arms  embellished  with  ornaments  and 
their  thighs  resembling  the  trunks  of  elephants. 

The  arrows  of  Rama,  discharged  from  the  bowstring,  cut 
down  horses  yoked  to  the  chariots  with  their  golden  trappings 
54 


ARANYA    KANDA 

together  with  the  charioteers ;  elephants  with  their  riders, 
horsemen  with  their  steeds,  were  aU  transfixed  by  his  shafts 
and  despatched  to  the  region  of  Yama. 

Pierced  by  those  pointed  shafts,  the  Rangers  of  the  Night, 
emitted  terrible  shrieks,  and  decimated  by  those  death-dealing 
arrows,  the  demon  host  was  unable  to  defend  itself,  as  dried 
wood  is  ignited  by  the  proximity  of  fire. 

Then  certain  demon  warriors,  full  of  energy  and  zeal,  in  a 
paroxysm  of  rage,  let  fly  lances,  tridents  and  other  weapons  at 
Rama,  but  he,  intercepting  them,  cut  off  the  heads  of  those 
demons  with  his  shafts,  thus  depriving  them  of  their  lives. 
They,  having  had  their  heads,  their  shields  and  their  bowstrings 
severed,  fell  to  the  earth,  like  trees  thrown  down  by  the  blast 
of  Garuda's  wings. 

Then  the  remaining  titans  fled,  seeking  refuge  from  those 
death-dealing  arrows  with  Khara,  but  Dushana,  taking  up  his 
bow,  rallied  them  and  rushed  on  Rama  as  if  he  were  Antaka 
himself;  thereafter  the  titans,  growing  bolder,  hurled  themselves 
on  Rama  anew,  armed  with  the  trunks  of  Sala  and  Tala  trees 
and  huge  rocks. 

With  lances,  maces  and  snares,  bearing  darts,  clubs  and 
nooses  in  their  hands,  those  great  warriors  covered  the  whole 
field  with  a  hail  of  missiles,  discharging  volleys  of  trees  and 
rocks.  Thereafter  the  combat  waxed  furious,  causing  the 
hair  to  stand  on  end,  and  now  it  seemed  as  if  Rama  were  the 
victor  and  again  the  demons  appeared  to  triumph.  Then, 
seeing  himself  beseiged  on  all  sides,  that  mighty  warrior  Rama, 
covered  by  a  hail  of  darts,  sent  up  a  terrific  shout,  placing  the 
mantra-propelled  Gandharva  weapon  on  his  bow,  whereupon 
a  thousand  arrows  sped  from  his  bent  bow,  covering  the  ten 
regions. 

With  such  skill  did  Rama  discharge  his  arrows,  that  the 
demons  were  unable  to  distinguish  when  he  drew  them  from 
their  quiver  and  when  he  loosed  them  and  his  shafts  caused 
darkness  to  spread  over  the  sky  and  obscure  the  sun. 

Slain  in  their  thousands,  the  demons  fell  in  heaps  and  the 
battlefield  was  strewn  with  corpses.  Struck  down,  dis- 
embowelled, transfixed,  torn  and  hacked  asunder,  they  could 
be  seen  in  their  hundreds,  and  the  ground  was  scattered  with 

55 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

heads  wrapped  in  turbans,  arms  encircled  with  bangles,  thighs 
and  torsos  with  their  ornaments,  horses,  mighty  elephants, 
shattered  chariots,  chowries,  fans,  umbrellas  and  standards  of 
every  kind,  and  beholding  the  slain,  the  remaining  demons 
were  afflicted  and  unable  to  withstand  Rama,  that  captor  of 
hostile  citadels,  further. 


CHAPTER    26 

Rama  destroys  the  Titans  and  slays  Duskana 

Seeing  his  forces  destroyed,  the  mighty-armed  Dushana  placed 
himself  at  the  head  of  five  thousand  intrepid  and  invincible 
titans,  to  whom  retreat  was  unknown. 

Armed  with  pikes,  sabres,  rocks  and  trees,  they  let  loose  a 
hail  of  missiles  on  Rama  from  every  side,  without  being  able 
to  wound  him.  Their  onslaught  was  formidable  and  to  all  but 
Rama,  deadly.  The  virtuous  Raghava,  however,  met  the 
attack  with  his  arrows,  his  eyes  closed,  as  unconcerned  as  a 
bull  under  heavy  rain.  Thereafter,  growing  wrath,  he  resolved 
to  destroy  the  whole  of  Khara*s  army  and,  burning  with  energy, 
covered  that  host  and  its  leader,  Dushana,  with  his  shafts, 
whereupon  Dushana,  the  Slayer  of  His  Foes,  met  Raghava  with 
weapons  that  resembled  thunderbolts.  Then  the  heroic  Rama, 
enraged,  severed  Dushana's  mighty  bow,  slew  the  four  steeds 
yoked  to  his  chariot  and  cut  off  the  head  of  his  charioteer  with 
a  crescent-shaped  arrow,  thereafter  piercing  Dushana's  breast 
thrice  with  his  shafts. 

Then  Dushana  lifted  up  his  mace  covered  with  gold,  that 
resembled  a  mountain  peak  and  was  capable  of  destroying  the 
army  of  the  Gods.  Studded  with  nails,  smeared  with  the 
flesh  of  his  foes,  keen  as  a  diamond,  able  to  cut  through  the 
gates  of  hostile  cities,  that  weapon,  resembling  a  mighty  snake, 
was  wielded  by  that  titan  of  evil  deeds,  who  hurled  himself 
on  Rama. 

56 


ARANYA    KANDA 

Nevertheless,  as  Dushana  rushed  upon  him,  Rama  cut  off 
both  his  arms  with  his  arrows,  and  that  mace,  loosed  from  his 
grasp,  fell  forward  on  the  field  like  unto  the  banner  of  Indra, 
whilst  Dushana,  bereft  of  it,  his  arms  severed,  sank  to  the  earth 
like  a  mighty  elephant  that,  stripped  of  its  tusks,  succumbs. 

Seeing  Dushana  lying  on  the  battlefield,  all  beings,  witness- 
ing that  conflict,  cried  out  "  Well  done !  Well  done !  "  and 
paid  obeisance  to  Rama. 

Meantime,  impelled  by  fate,  the  three  generals,  Mahakapala, 
Sthulaksha  and  the  mighty  Titan  Pramathin  rushed  on  Rama ; 
Mahakapala  brandishing  a  great  trident,  Sthulaksha  bearing  a 
harpoon  and  Pramathin,  a  huge  axe.  Seeing  them  advancing, 
Raghava,  taking  out  some  sharp  steel-pointed  arrows,  went 
forward  to  meet  them,  as  one  receives  a  guest,  and  the  Delight 
of  the  House  of  Raghu  severed  the  head  of  Mahakapala  with 
a  single  arrow  and  assailed  Pramathin  with  innumerable  shafts, 
whereupon  he  fell  to  the  earth  like  an  axed  tree ;  thereafter, 
Rama  blinded  Sthulaksha  with  his  sharp  arrows  and,  inflamed 
with  wrath,  with  five  thousand  shafts  slew  an  equal  number 
of  Dushana's  followers,  sending  them  to  the  nether  regions. 

Hearing  that  Dushana  and  his  warriors  were  lying  dead, 
Khara,  in  great  fury,  addressed  the  leaders  of  the  army, 
saying : — "  Let  all  the  titans  attack  that  evil  wretch,  Rama, 
and  strike  him  with  weapons  of  every  kind." 

Speaking  thus,  Khara,  full  of  wrath,  flung  himself  on  Rama, 
followed  by  Durjaya,  Karaviraksha,  Parusha,  Kalakarmuka, 
Hemamalin,  Mahamalin,  Sarpashya,  Syengamin,  Prithagriva, 
Vajnasatru,  Vihangama  and  Rudhinashana,  those  twelve 
valiant  generals  with  their  forces,  who  fell  upon  Rama,  dis- 
charging their  excellent  shafts. 

And  Rama,  endowed  with  supreme  energy,  with  his  gold  and 
diamond  encrusted  arrows,  despatched  the  remainder  of 
Khara's  forces,  and  those  shafts,  bereft  of  feathers,  like  golden 
stalks,  resembling  flames  wreathed  in  smoke,  laid  those  demons 
low,  as  lightning  fells  the  giant  trees.  With  a  hundred  ear- 
shaped  arrows,  Rama  slew  a  hundred  titans ;  and  a  thousand 
with  as  many  shafts.  Their  breastplates  and  ornaments 
shattered,  their  bows  broken,  thbse  Rangers  of  the  Night  fell 
on  the  earth,  bathed  in  blood.  Their  hair  dishevelled,  covered 
57 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

with  gore,  they  lay  on  the  battlefield,  like  kusha  grass  scattered 
on  the  altar,  and  that  great  forest,  strewn  with  the  corpses  of 
demons  and  befouled  with  their  flesh  and  blood,  resembled 
the  region  of  hell. 

Fourteen  thousand  demons  of  cruel  deeds  were  slain  by 
Rama,  a  mortal,  single-handed  and  on  foot !  Out  of  the  whole 
army  only  Khara  of  the  great  Car  and  the  Titan,  Trishiras 
survived,  all  others  being  slain  by  Lakshmana's  elder  brother, 
the  illustrious  Rama. 

Thereafter,  seeing  that  vast  army  destroyed  in  the  great 
conflict,  Khara,  ascending  his  splendid  chariot,  advanced  on 
Raghava  with  his  mace  upraised. 


CHAPTER    27 

Rama  and  Trishiras  meet  in  Combat     Trishiras  is  slain 

As  Khara  was  advancing  on  Rama,  the  leader  of  the  army, 
Trishiras  approached  him  and  said : — "  O  Lord,  refrain  from 
engaging  Rama  in  combat  and  having  recourse  to  me,  who  am 
possessed  of  prowess,  witness  his  defeat.  I  swear  to  thee  by 
my  sword  that  I  will  slay  Rama  and  avenge  the  death  of  the 
entire  demon  host.  In  this  fight  I  shall  be  as  Mrityu  to  him 
or  he  to  me,  but  thou,  O  Excellent  One,  shouldst  restrain  thy 
martial  ardour  awhile  and  be  a  spectator  only.  Should  Rama 
be  slain,  thou  canst  return  home  triumphant,  but  should  I  die, 
do  thou  enter  the  field  against  him." 

Yielding  to  the  persuasions  of  Trishiras,  Khara  said  to  him, 
who  was  already  doomed  : — "  Go,  engage  Rama  in  combat !  " 

Thereupon  Trishiras,  like  a  triple  crested  mountain,  advanced 
on  Raghava  in  a  glittering  chariot  yoked  to  excellent  steeds 
and,  as  a  great  cloud  pours  down  rain,  so  he  discharged  a  volley 
of  arrows,  roaring  the  while  like  a  kettledrum. 

Seeing  that  demon  drawing  near,  Rama  loosed  some  pointed 
shafts  and  a  terrible  struggle  ensued,  so  that  it  seemed  as  if 
a  great  lion  and  a  mighty  elephant  were  fighting  together. 
58 


ARANYA    KANDA 

Trishiras,  having  pierced  Rama's  forehead  with  three  darts, 
that  hero,  enraged,  addressed  him  in  biting  accents,  saying: — 

"  O  Valiant  Titan,  the  arrows  thou  hast  loosed  I  bear  on  my 
brow  as  a  wreath,  do  thou  now  receive  the  shafts  from  my  bow." 

Thereupon  Rama  let  fly  fourteen  serpentine  arrows  striking 
Trishiras  on  the  breast  and  with  four  further  shafts  brought 
down  his  four  steeds,  killing  his  charioteer  with  eight  other 
darts  and  with  a  single  arrow  severing  the  up-raised  standard 
in  the  front  of  his  car.  Then,  as  that  Ranger  of  the  Night  was 
alighting  from  his  shattered  chariot,  Rama  pierced  his  breast 
with  further  arrows,  depriving  him  of  his  senses,  and  that  one 
of  immeasurable  prowess  with  his  swift  arrows  cut  off  the 
three  heads  of  Trishiras,  causing  the  blood  to  flow  from  the 
stricken  trunk,  and  the  heads  of  that  Ranger  of  the  Night  fell 
while  he  yet  stood  upright  after  the  destruction  of  his  forces. 

Then  the  remaining  titans,  losing  heart,  sped  away  like  deer 
stampeding  on  the  approach  of  a  hunter,  and  Khara,  beholding 
them  fleeing,  waxing  wrath,  rallied  them  and  rushed  on  Rama 
as  Rahu  on  the  moon. 


CHAPTER    2 8 

The  Combat  between  Rama  and  Kkara 

Seeing  that  Dushana  and  Trishiras  had  been  slain  in  the  fight 
and  witnessing  Rama's  prowess,  Khara  was  rilled  with  appre- 
hension and  reflected : — 

"  My  vast  army  with  my  generals  Dushana  and  Trishiras 
has  been  destroyed  by  Rama,  single-handed." 

Whereupon  that  Demon  Khara,  was  seized  with  despondency 
and  hurled  himself  on  Rama,  as  the  Titan  Namuchi  on  Indra. 
Stretching  his  mighty  bow,  Khara  discharged  at  Rama  some 
blood-sucking  arrows,  resembling  venomous  snakes,  and, 
mounted  on  bis  chariot,  began  to  range  over  the  battlefield, 
displaying  his  skill  in  the  use  of  weapons,  covering  the  four 
quarters  with  his  shafts. 

59 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Beholding  this,  as  Parjanya  with  his  watery  floods,  Rama, 
armed  with  his  mighty  bow,  filled  the  entire  firmament  with  his 
irresistible  shafts,  which  resembled  tongues  of  fire,  and  all  space 
was  filled  with  arrows  on  every  side,  which  had  been  loosed 
by  Khara  and  Rama. 

As  those  two  heroes  struggled  together,  the  sun  was  obscured 
and  darkness  descended ;  then,  like  a  mighty  elephant  struck 
with  a  goad,  Rama  assailed  his  opponent  with  Nalikas,  Narachas 
and  sharp-pointed  Vikarnas,  and  that  demon,  standing  in  his 
chariot,  bow  in  hand,  resembled  Death  himself  carrying  his 
noose.  At  that  moment  Khara  deemed  the  destroyer  of  his 
forces,  endued  with  heroism,  the  extremely  powerful  Rama, 
to  be  overcome  with  fatigue,  but  Rama  remained  unmoved 
under  Khara's  assaults,  as  a  mighty  lion  ignores  the  presence 
of  an  insignificant  deer. 

Then  Khara,  in  his  chariot  blazing  like  the  sun,  drew 
near  to  Rama,  as  a  moth  approaches  a  flame  and,  displaying 
his  skill,  severed  Rama's  bow  at  the  point  where  he  held  it, 
thereafter  loosing  seven  mace-like  shafts  resembling  Indra's 
thunderbolts,  which  shattered  the  armour  of  his  adversary 
resplendent  as  the  sun  itself,  so  that  it  fell  on  the  earth.  Roaring 
like  a  lion,  he  let  loose  a  thousand  arrows,  wounding  Rama  of 
unparalleled  might,  and  in  that  conflict  Khara  set  up  a  mighty 
shout. 

Pierced  by  Khara's  arrows,  the  body  of  Rama  resembled  a 
clear  and  smokeless  flame,  and  that  Destroyer  of  his  Foes,  in 
order  to  compass  the  titan's  defeat,  took  up  another  great 
bow,  stringing  it  with  a  mighty  twanging.  Holding  aloft  that 
prodigious  bow,  named  Vaishnava,  bestowed  on  him  by  the 
Rishi  Agastya,  Rama  rushed  on  Khara,  letting  fly  his  arrows 
furnished  with  golden  feathers  and  cut  down  his  banner  plated 
with  gold,  which  fell  from  the  chariot,  as  the  sun  falls  on  the 
earth,  cursed  by  the  Gods. 

Highly  provoked,  Khara  aimed  at  the  heart  of  Rama  and 
pierced  him  with  four  arrows,  so  that  he  resembled  a  great 
elephant  under  the  deluge  in  the  rainy  season,  and  Rama, 
sorely  wounded  by  his  shafts,  covered  with  blood,  waxed 
wrath  and  that  foremost  of  bowmen,  with  consummate  skill, 
let  fly  six  well-directed  arrows.  With  one,  he  struck  the  head 
60 


ARANYA    KANDA 

of  Khara,  with  two  others,  his  arms,  and  with  the  remaining 
three  crescent-shaped  darts,  he  pierced  his  breast.  There- 
after that  illustrious  warrior,  in  his  ire,  let  fly  thirteen  arrows 
sharpened  on  the  whetstone,  blazing  like  the  sun  ;  one  severed 
the  shafts  of  his  adversary's  car,  four  more  felling  the  steeds ; 
with  a  sixth  he  smote  the  head  of  his  charioteer,  and  with  three 
others  that  great  and  intrepid  warrior,  shattered  the  axles  of 
the  chariot ;  with  the  twelfth  he  severed  Khara's  bow  at  the 
point  where  he  held  it,  and  with  the  thirteenth  arrow,  that 
shone  like  lightning,  Raghava,  who  was  equal  to  Indra,  trans- 
fixed Khara,  as  it  were  in  sport. 

His  bow  shattered,  deprived  of  his  chariot,  his  horses  slain, 
his  charioteer  fallen,  Khara,  mace  in  hand,  sprang  to  the 
ground  and  stood  waiting. 

Seeing  Rama's  feat  of  arms  that  was  unsurpassed,  the  Gods 
and  great  Sages  rejoiced  and,  assembling  in  the  sky,  with  joined 
palms,  extolling  the  wonderful  exploit  of  that  mighty  warrior, 
offered  obeisance  to  him. 


CHAPTER     29 

Rama  and  the  Demon  Khara  taunt  one  another 

Then  the  illustrious  Rama  addressed  Khara,  who  was  standing 
mace  in  hand,  bereft  of  his  chariot,  and  in  severe  accents,  said: — 

"  O  Hero,  with  the  support  of  this  army  of  elephants,  horses, 
chariots  and  men,  thou  hast  adopted  a  course  of  action  con- 
demned by  all.  He  who  inflicts  pain  on  others  by  oppressing 
them,  who  is  ruthless  and  engaged  in  evil  deeds,  will  never 
know  happiness,  even  though  he  be  Lord  of  the  Three  Worlds. 

"  O  Ranger  of  the  Night,  one  who,  like  a  tyrant,  works 
against  the  interests  of  others  and  resembles  a  vicious  and 
marauding  snake,  is  ultimately  destroyed !  He  who,  overcome 
by  avarice  or  envy,  pursues  an  evil  course,  without  reflecting 
on  the  consequences,  forfeits  his  life  and  comes  to  a  miserable 
end,  like  a  branmany  duck  that  feeds  on  hailstones. 
61 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  O  Titan,  how  canst  thou  evade  the  consequences  of  the 
murder  of  those  ascetics  dwelling  in  the  Dandaka  Forest, 
enhancing  their  merit  by  the  practice  of  virtue  ? 

"  Even  if  they  attain  to  sovereignty,  the  wicked,  engaged  in 
cruel  deeds,  condemned  by  all  men,  do  not  enjoy  it  long,  but 
fall  like  trees  whose  roots  have  been  severed. 

"  O  Dweller  in  the  Darkness,  as  in  its  proper  season  the 
tree  puts  forth  its  flowers,  so  in  die  course  of  time  evil  actions 
produce  bitter  fruit. 

"As  a  man  who  swallows  poison  soon  succumbs,  so  does 
the  sinner  swiftly  reap  the  fruits  of  his  evil  actions.  It  is  to 
put  down  the  instigators  of  evil,  the  oppressors  of  others,  that 
I,  under  the  orders  of  the  King,  have  come  hither.  To-day 
my  shining  arrows  shall  penetrate  thy  flesh,  as  serpents  enter 
an  ant-heap,  and  thou  shalt  follow  in  the  wake  of  those  virtuous 
ascetics  inhabiting  the  forest,  whom  thou  hast  slain  without 
provocation.  Soon  those  excellent  sages,  formerly  slain  by 
thee,  shall  in  their  aerial  chariots  return  to  behold  thee  lying  in 
hell  laid  low  by  mine  arrows.  O  Worst  of  Men,  O  Thou  who 
art  of  an  odious  race,  defend  thyself  as  thou  wilt,  I  shall  presently 
cut  off  thine  head  like  the  fruit  of  a  palm  tree." 

Hearing  Rama's  words,  Khara,  his  eyes  inflamed  with 
anger,  beside  himself  with  rage,  answered  mockingly : — "  O 
Son  of  Dasaratha,  thou  art  but  a  common  man ;  yet,  having 
slain  these  insignificant  titans  in  battle,  thou  dost  extol  thyself 
without  reason.  Those  who  are  brave  and  valiant  never  boast 
of  their  prowess ;  only  the  scum  of  the  warrior  caste  praise 
themselves  as  thou  hast  done.  Where  is  the  warrior  who, 
on  the  battlefield,  his  death  imminent,  would  hymn  his  own 
praise?  Thou  hast  revealed  thy  worthlessness  by  this  self- 
glorification,  as  brass  wearing  the  semblance  of  gold  reveals 
its  true  value  in  a  fire  of  kusha  grass. 

"  O  Rama,  armed  with  a  mace,  I  stand  immoveable  on  the 
field,  like  a  mountain  enriched  by  precious  metals.  Behold 
me  with  my  mace,  like  unto  Antaka  himself,  armed  with  his 
noose,  about  to  end  thy  life;  I  shall  destroy  not  only  thee, 
but  the  Three  Worlds !  I  could  utter  more,  but  refrain,  lest 
our  combat  be  intercepted  as  the  hour  of  sunset  is  near. 
Fourteen  thousand  titans  have  fallen  under  thy  blows;  by 
62 


ARANYA    KANDA 

slaying  thee  to-day  I  shall  wipe  away  the  tears  of  their  relatives." 
Speaking  thus,  Khara,  filled  with  fury,  hurled  his  marvellous 
gold-encircled  mace  at  Rama.  Leaving  the  hand  of  Rhara, 
that  massive  and  effulgent  mace,  resembling  a  blazing  thunder- 
bolt, consuming  the  trees  and  bushes  to  ashes,  drew  near  to 
Rama,  but  he,  as  it  was  about  to  fall  like  the  noose  of  death, 
shattered  it  to  fragments  with  his  arrows  while  yet  in  the  air. 
Crushed  and  broken,  it  fell  to  earth  like  a  serpent  stricken 
by  the  efficacy  of  herbs  and  the  power  of  incantations. 


chapter   30 

The  Death  of  Khara 

Having  intercepted  and  shattered  that  great  mace  with  his 
arrows,  the  ever  virtuous  Rama,  though  still  wrath,  spoke  as 
if  in  jest : — 

"  O  Titan,  is  this  the  extent  of  thy  power  ?  How  strange 
that  one  so  deficient  in  prowess  should  boast  so  loudly ! 
Severed  by  my  shafts,  behold  thy  mace  lies  in  pieces  on  the 
earth !  Thou  hast  bragged  to  no  purpose !  Didst  thou  not 
declare :  *  I  will  wipe  away  the  tears  shed  for  the  death  of 
the  titans  *  ?  Vain  words  !  As  Garuda  of  old  stole  the  nectar 
of  immortality,  I  am  about  to  deprive  thee  of  thy  life,  thou 
vile  and  lying  wretch !  The  earth  this  day  will  quaff  the 
foaming  blood  issuing  from  thy  throat,  which  my  shafts  have 
severed.  Soon  shall  thy  body,  covered  with  dust,  the  arms 
extended,  embrace  the  earth,  as  a  frenzied  lover  embraces  the 
woman  he  has  won,  after  long  delay. 

"  O  Obloquy  of  Thy  Race,  on  thy  death  the  Dandaka  Forest 
will  become  a  refuge  for  those  who  are  themselves  a  refuge ; 
my  shafts  will  rid  the  forest  of  all  titans  and  the  ascetics  will 
wander  about  there  without  fear.  To-day  the  titan  women 
in  sore  distress,  weeping  and  terrified,  will  fly  this  place.  They 
who  inspired  terror  in  others,  having  evil-doers  such  as  thou 
as  their  consorts,  shall  to-day  taste  the  pangs  of  sorrow !  O 
cruel,  fallen  and  false-hearted  Wretch,  in  fear  of  whom  the 
63 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

sages,  tremble  as  they  pour  forth   their  oblations  into  the 
sacred  fire." 

As  Raghava,  swayed  by  anger,  uttered  these  words,  Khara, 
foaming  with  rage,  began  to  hurl  abuses  at  him,  saying : — 

"  Verily,  despite  thy  boasting  thou  art  filled  with  terror 
and  in  the  face  of  death  dost  not  know  whether  to  speak  or  to 
be  silent.  Those  about  to  die  lose  the  power  of  their  five 
senses  and  no  longer  know  what  is  right  and  wrong." 

Having  spoken  thus,  that  Ranger  of  the  Night,  Khara, 
scowling,  looked  round  him  for  a  weapon  and,  perceiving  a 
great  palm  tree  near  at  hand,  forcibly  uprooted  it  and  whirling 
it  with  terrific  energy  hurled  it  at  Rama,  roaring  :  "  Now  thou 
art  slain !  " 

Thereupon,  Raghava  with  his  weapon  cut  that  tree  to  pieces 
and  in  an  access  of  rage  resolved  to  slay  Khara.  His  body 
covered  with  sweat,  his  eyes  inflamed,  he  pierced  Khara  with 
innumerable  darts,  so  that  rivers  of  blood  gushed  from  his 
wounds,  as  do  the  torrents  from  the  mountain  Prasravana. 

Stupefied  by  Rama's  arrows  and  maddened  by  the  smell  of 
blood,  Khara  rushed  at  Rama,  who,  seeing  him  approach  full 
of  fury  and  covered  with  gore,  retreated  a  few  paces ;  then, 
in  order  to  slay  him,  he  selected  an  arrow  that  shone  like  fire, 
resembling  the  Rod  of  Brahma.  And  that  righteous  One  dis- 
charged that  shaft  at  Khara,  which  had  been  conferred  on 
the  Sage  Agastya  by  Indra,  and  like  a  thunderbolt  it  struck 
his  breast  so  that  he,  consumed  by  the  flame  issuing  there- 
from, fell  to  the  ground.  As  Rudra  with  his  third  eye  con- 
sumed the  demon  Andhaka  in  the  forest  of  Sweta,  as  Vritra 
was  slain  by  the  thunderbolt,  as  Namuchi  by  the  foam,  as 
Bal  by  Indra's  mace,  so  did  Khara  fall. 

Then  the  Gods  and  the  Charanas  assembled  and,  amazed 
and  delighted,  struck  their  drums,  showering  flowers  on  Rama 
and  saying : — "  In  this  great  conflict  Raghava,  by  means  of  his 
pointed  shafts,  has  in  an  instant  slain  fourteen  thousand 
demons,  able  to  change  their  shape  at  will,  with  their  generals, 
Khara  and  Dushana.  Great  indeed  is  this  exploit  of  Rama, 
versed  in  the  science  of  the  Self.  What  valour  !  His  prowess 
resembles  that  of  Vishnu  himself !  " 
Saying  this,  the  Gods  returned  from  whence  they  had  come. 
64 


ARANYA    KANDA 

Thereafter  the  Rajarishis  and  Paramarishis,  accompanied  by 
Agastya,  joyfully  paid  homage  to  Rama  and  said : — 

"  It  was  for  this  that  the  Slayer  of  Paka,  the  mighty  Purandara, 
visited  the  hermitage  of  the  Sage  Sharabhanga.  It  was  for 
this  that  the  great  Rishis  brought  thee  to  this  place,  O  Prince, 
that  thou  mightest  compass  the  destruction  of  the  titans  of 
evil  deeds.  Thou  hast  fulfilled  thy  mission  amongst  us,  O 
Son  of  Dasaratha  ;  from  to-day  the  virtuous  sages  may  per- 
form their  devotions  in  the  Dandaka  Forest  in  peace." 

Then  that  hero,  Lakshmana,  accompanied  by  Sita,  issued 
from  the  mountain  cavern  and  joyfully  entered  the  hermitage, 
and  the  victorious  and  heroic  Rama,  honoured  by  the  great 
Sages,  returned  to  the  ashrama,  where  Lakshmana  paid  h'tn 
obeisance. 

Seeing  her  consort  returning  victorious,  having  brought 
felicity  to  the  ascetics,  the  happy  Vaidehi  embraced  him. 
Beholding  those  hosts  of  demons  slain,  and  that  Destroyer  of 
Enemy  Hosts  worshipped  by  the  magnanimous  sages,  the 
daughter  of  Janaka  began  to  minister  to  her  lord  and  full 
of  joy,  embracing  him  afresh  in  her  delight,  experienced  supreme 
happiness. 


CHAPTER     31 

Havana  hears  of  the  Death  of  Khara  and  determines  to  slay  Rama 

The  Titan  Akampana,  speedily  leaving  Janasthana,  repaired  to 
Lanka  in  order  to  seek  out  Ravana,  addressing  him  thus : — 

"  O  King,  the  innumerable  titans  dwelling  in  Janasthana 
have  perished  and  Khara  himself  has  fallen  on  the  field  of 
battle;  by  some  chance,  I  have  been  enabled  to  reach  this 
place  alive." 

Hearing  these  words,  Ravana,  his  eyes  growing  red  with 
anger,  bent  his  gaze  on  Akampana  as  if  he  would  consume 
him,  and  said : — 

"  Who,  seeking  his  own  destruction,  has  dared  to  exter- 
minate my  people  ?  None  in  the  world  will  be  able  to  protect 
«5 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

him,  not  even  Indra,  Kuvera,  Yama  or  Vishnu  himself.  No 
man  can  save  him  who  has  defied  me  !  I  am  the  Lord  of  Time, 
the  Consumer  of  Fire,  the  death  of  Death  itself !  In  my  wrath 
I  am  able  to  reduce  Aditya  and  Pavaka  to  ashes  !  Verily  I  can 
subdue  the  very  wind  in  its  course !  " 

On  this,  Akampana,  with  joined  palms,  in  a  voice  strangled 
with  terror,  solicited  the  protection  of  that  Ten-necked  One, 
who  was  mad  with  anger,  whereupon  that  Lord  of  the  Titans 
gave  him  the  assurance  of  safety,  inspiring  him  with  confidence, 
and  Akampana  thereafter  addressed  him  boldly,  saying : — 

"  There  is  a  son  of  King  Dasaratha,  who  is  youthful,  re- 
sembling a  lion,  broad-shouldered  like  unto  a  bull,  possessing 
long  arms,  handsome,  renowned  and  of  immeasurable  prowess ; 
his  name  is  Rama ;  it  is  he,  who  in  Janasthana  has  slain  Khara 
and  Dushana." 

At  these  words,  Ravana,  King  of  the  Titans,  breathing  like 
a  great  serpent,  enquired  of  Akampana,  saying  : — "  O  Akampana, 
when  he  came  to  Janasthana  was  Rama  accompanied  by  the 
Leader  of  the  Gods  and  all  the  Celestials  ?  " 

On  hearing  Ravana's  words,  Akampana  began  to  describe  the 
great  and  noble  exploits  of  Raghava,  saying : — 

"  O  King,  Rama  is  a  mighty  warrior,  an  invincible  archer 
and  the  equal  of  Indra  himself  in  prowess ;  his  eyes  are  slightly 
red  and  his  voice  resembles  a  kettledrum,  his  countenance  is 
like  unto  the  full  moon.  Followed  by  Lakshmana,  as  Anila 
follows  Pavaka,  this  is  the  fortunate  leader  of  monarchs  who 
has  destroyed  thy  colony,  as  fire,  fanned  by  the  wind,  con- 
sumes a  forest !  Rama  was  in  no  wise  assisted  by  the  Gods — 
of  this  there  is  no  doubt — but  bis  golden-winged  arrows  flying 
through  the  air,  transforming  themselves  into  five-headed 
snakes,  destroyed  the  demons.  O  Mighty  Sovereign,  wherever 
they  fled  in  their  terror,  they  beheld  Rama  standing  before 
them,  and  in  this  wise  Janasthana  was  destroyed  by  him." 

Hearing  Akampana's  words,  Ravana  cried  out : — "  I  shall  go 
to  Janasthana  and  slay  Rama  and  Lakshmana  !  " 

Thereupon  Akampana  answered  him,  saying : — 

"  O  King,  hear  from  me  the  true  measure  of  Rama's  strength 
and  prowess.  Supremely  virtuous  and  brave,  none  in  the 
world  is  able  to  subdue  him  in  his  wrath.  By  means  of  his 
66 


ARANYA    KANDA 

shafts,  he  is  able  to  stem  a  river  in  its  course  and  shatter  the 
very  firmament  with  its  stars  and  planets ;  nay,  if  the  earth 
were  to  be  submerged,  he  could  raise  it  up  and,  should  he  so 
desire  it,  change  the  boundaries  of  the  sea  and  flood  the  conti- 
nents with  its  waters.  He  is  able  to  subdue  all  creatures  and 
control  the  course  of  the  wind  itself ;  indeed  that  foremost  of 
persons,  having  destroyed  the  worlds,  can  create  a  new  universe. 
O  Ten-necked  One,  as  a  sinner  is  not  able  to  enter  heaven, 
neither  canst  thou,  nor  thy  titans,  defeat  Rama  in  combat. 
The  Gods  and  titans  together  cannot  overcome  him;  yet 
there  is  a  way  of  destroying  him,  which  I  will  now  unfold 
to  thee. 

"  Rama  is  wedded  to  one  more  beautiful  than  any  woman 
on  earth,  and  that  slender-waisted  damsel  is  known  by  the  name 
of  Sita.  In  the  full  bloom  of  youth,  and  possessed  of  well-pro- 
portioned  limbs,  she  is  a  jewel  adorned  by  jewels.  In  loveliness, 
she  surpasses  the  celestial  beings,  nymphs  and  nagas.  Having 
lured  Rama  into  the  forest,  do  thou  carry  her  away !  Bereft 
of  Sita,  Rama  will  not  survive  ! " 

The  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas  was  highly  gratified  to  hear  these 
words  and,  after  a  little  reflection,  said  to  Akampana : — *'  Be 
it  so !  To-morrow,  accompanied  by  my  charioteer  alone,  I 
shall,  with  a  glad  heart,  bring  back  the  Princess  of  Videha  to 
this  spacious  palace !  " 

The  following  day,  Ravana  started  out  in  his  chariot,  yoked 
to  mules,  and  it  was  bright  as  the  sun,  illumining  the  four 
quarters.  Following  the  path  of  the  stars  in  its  rapid  course, 
it  resembled  the  moon  itself  surrounded  by  clouds. 

Proceeding  to  a  great  distance,  he  approached  the  hermitage 
of  Taraka's  son,  Maricha,  who  entertained  him  with  marvellous 
dishes  unknown  to  man.  Presenting  him  with  a  seat  and 
water  wherewith  to  wash  his  feet,  that  demon  addressed  him, 
saying : — "  O  Lord  of  the  Titans,  is  it  well  with  thee  and  thy 
people  ?  O  Sovereign,  being  ignorant  of  thine  intention,  thine 
unexpected  and  sudden  advent  fills  me  with  apprehension ! " 

Then  the  resplendent  and  eloquent  Ravana  answered  Maricha, 
saying: — 

"  O  Friend  !  Rama,  who  is  able  to  achieve  that  from  which 
reason  recoils,  has  destroyed  the  entire  colony  of  Janasthana, 
67  f 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

heretofore  impregnable,  as  also  my  generals,  Khara  and 
Dushana,  Do  thou,  therefore,  aid  me  in  bearing  off  bis 
consort,  Sita." 

Hearing  these  words  of  the  King  of  the  Titans,  Maricha 
answered : — **  O  King,  the  man  who  has  thus  counselled  thee 
concerning  Sita  is  assuredly  an  enemy  in  the  guise  of  a  friend. 
By  such  advice,  he  has  unquestionably  affronted  thee  and  is 
envious  of  thy  great  might. 

" '  Bear  Sita  away !  *  who  has  uttered  such  words  ?  Who 
seeks  to  cut  off  the  head  of  the  entire  titan  host  ?  Without 
doubt  the  man  who  has  thus  counselled  thee  is  thine  enemy, 
since  he  desires  thee  to  extract  the  poison  fangs  of  a  serpent 
with  thy  bare  hands.  Who  is  it  who  seeks  to  lead  thee  astray 
and  strikes  thine  head  whilst  thou  art  sleeping  happily  ? 

"  Raghava,  that  intoxicated  elephant,  may  not  be  withstood 
on  the  field  of  battle.  With  the  lineage  of  an  illustrious  House 
as  his  trunk,  his  valour  the  ichor,  his  outstretched  arms  the 
tusks,  thou  art  wholly  unable  to  pit  thyself  against  him.  Do 
not  rouse  that  sleeping  Hon  who  hunts  the  titans  as  deer,  the 
arrows  of  whose  quiver  are  his  talons,  his  sharp  sword  the  jaws. 

"  O  King  of  the  Titans,  do  not  hurl  thyself  into  that  dreadful 
and  bottomless  ocean  called  Rama,  whose  bow  is  the  crocodile, 
the  strength  of  whose  arm  is  the  quagmire,  whose  shafts  are 
the  rising  waves,  and  whose  battlefield  is  its  waters. 

"  O  Lord  of  Lanka,  compose  thyself  and  return  in  peace  to 
thy  capital.  O  Indra  of  Titans,  continue  to  enjoy  the  company 
of  thy  consorts,  and  let  Rama  delight  in  his  own,  in  the  forest." 

Hearing  the  words  of  Maricha,  the  ten-headed  Ravana 
returned  to  the  city  of  Lanka  and  re-entered  his  palace.

Skurpanakha  upbraids  Ravana  and  urges  him  to  destroy  Rama 

When  Shurpanakha  saw  those  fourteen  thousand  titans  of 

dreadful  deeds  slain  by  Rama  single-handed  on  the  field  of 

battle,  together  with  Khara,  Dushana  and  Trishiras,  she  once 

68 


ARANYA    KAKDA 

more  emitted  dreadful  shrieks  and  roared  like  thunder. 
Perceiving  the  incomparable  prowess  of  Raghava,  she  became 
exceedingly  agitated  and  proceeded  to  Lanka,  Ravana's  capital. 
There  she  beheld  Ravana  shining  in  glory*  surrounded  by 
his  ministers  on  the  terrace  of  his  palace,  like  India  amidst 
the  Maruts.  Seated  on  his  golden  throne,  blazing  like  a 
flame,  Ravana  resembled  a  great  fire  kindled  on  an  altar,  kept 
alive  by  sacrificial  offerings.  Unconquered  by  Gods,  Gan- 
dharvas,  Rishis  or  other  creatures,  that  warrior,  who  resembled 
death  itself  with  wide-open  jaws,  bore  on  his  person  the 
wounds  inflicted  by  the  thunderbolts  in  the  war  between 
Gods  and  titans  and  on  his  breast  the  marks  of  Airavata's  tusks. 
Having  twenty  arms,  ten  heads,  a  broad  chest,  wearing 
gorgeous  attire  and  bearing  the  marks  of  royalty,  he  was 
adorned  with  a  chain  of  emeralds  and  ornaments  of  fine  gold 
and  with  his  great  arms,  white  teeth  and  enormous  mouth 
resembled  a  mountain. 

In  the  combat  with  the  Gods,  Vishnu  had  struck  him  a 
hundred  times  with  his  discus,  and  he  bore  the  marks  of  other 
weapons  from  that  great  struggle,  yet  his  limbs  were  intact 
and  had  not  been  severed.  He  who  was  able  to  churn  up  the 
seas,  a  feat  not  to  be  performed  by  any  other,  whose  missiles 
were  the  mountain  crests,  he  the  scourge  of  the  Gods,  who 
transgressed  every  moral  law,  the  ravisher  of  others'  wives, 
the  wielder  of  celestial  weapons,  the  destroyer  of  sacrifices, 
who  descended  into  the  city  of  Bhogavati  and  subdued  the 
serpent  Vasuki,  from  whom,  on  his  defeat,  he  stole  the  gentle 
consort ;  he  who  scaled  Mount  Kailasha  and  overcame  Kuvera 
depriving  him  of  his  aerial  chariot  Pushpaka,  which  trans- 
ported him  wheresoever  he  desired;  he  who  in  his  anger 
destroyed  the  garden  of  Chaitaratha,  the  lotus  pool  and  the 
Nandana  Grove  and  all  the  pleasurable  retreats  of  the  Gods, 
and  with  his  vast  arms,  resembling  the  peaks  of '  mountains, 
arrested  the  course  of  the  sun  and  moon,  twin  scourgcts  of 
their  foes,  rising  in  splendour;  practising  asceticism  in  the 
mighty  forest  for  a  thousand  years  he  offered  his  heads  in 
sacrifice  to  Swyambhu  and  obtained  the  boon  that  neither 
Deva,  Danava,  Gandharva,  Pisacha,  Pataya  nor  Uraga  should 
be  able  to  slay  him,  but  of  man  there  was  no  mention; 
69 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

proud  of  his  strength,  he  stole  the  Soma  juice,  sanctified 
by  mantras,  before  its  pressing  by  the  Twice-born  in  the 
sacrifice ;  this  perverse  wretch,  Ravana  of  evil  deeds,  slayer  of 
the  brahmins,  ruthless,  pitiless,  delighting  in  causing  harm  to 
others,  was  verily  a  source  of  terror  to  all  beings. 

The  titan  woman  beheld  her  brother  full  of  power,  resplendent 
in  gorgeous  attire,  adorned  with  celestial  garlands,  seated  on 
his  throne,  resembling  Time  at  the  destruction  of  the  worlds, 
that  Indra  of  Demons,  the  proud  descendant  of  Poulastya 
and  she,  trembling  with  fear,  in  order  to  address  him,  drew 
near  to  the  Slayer  of  his  Enemies,  who  was  seated  amidst  his 
counsellors.  Distracted  with  terror  and  passion,  Shurpanakha, 
who  was  wont  to  roam  everywhere  unafraid,  now  mutilated  by 
the  order  of  that  magnanimous  Ramachandra,  displaying  her 
ravaged  features  before  Ravana,  whose  large  eyes  appeared  to 
shoot  forth  flames,  uttered  these  bitter  words  to  him : 


CHAPTER    33 

Shurpanakha's  Words  to  Ravana 

Filled    with    anger,    Shurpanakha    addressed    Ravana,    the 
Oppressor  of  the  Worlds,  in  harsh  accents,  saying : — 

"  O  Ravana,  wholly  devoted  to  pleasure  and  indulging  in 
every  whim  without  scruple,  thou  art  oblivious  of  the  great 
calamity  that  threatens  thee.  That  monarch  who  is  given  up 
to  lust  and  other  dissipations  and  who  is  covetous,  is  disregarded 
by  his  subjects,  as  is  the  fire  in  the  crematorium.  That  king 
who  does  not  fulfil  his  duties  at  the  proper  season  brings  ruin 
on  his  state.  The  Prince  who,  committing  excess,  is  ruled  by 
his  consorts  and  readily  gives  credence  to  other's  counsel,  is 
shunned  as  the  mud  of  a  river  is  shunned  by  an  elephant. 
Those  rulers  who  are  unable  to  protect  their  lands  or  reclaim 
the  territory  wrested  from  them,  live  without  glory,  like  moun- 
tains submerged  in  the  ocean. 

"  At  enmity  with  the  Gods,  the  Gandharvas  and  the  Danavas, 
who  are  masters  of  themselves,  doing  what  ought  not  to  be 
done  and  inconstant,  how  art  thou  able  to  rule  as  king  ? 
70 


ARANYA    KANDA 

"  O  Titan,  thou  art  childish  and  thoughtless  and  art  not 
conversant  with  that  which  should  be  known  to  thee ;  how 
canst  thou  govern  ?  Those  monarchs  who  have  neither 
emissaries,  wealth  nor  policy  at  their  disposal,  resemble  a 
common  man,  O  Prince  of  Conquerors !  Since  kings  are 
informed  by  their  spies  as  to  what  is  taking  place  abroad,  they 
are  said  to  be  far-sighted.  Meseems  thou  dost  not  discharge 
thy  duty  and  that  the  counsellors  who  surround  thee  are  in- 
experienced, since  thou  art  insensible  to  the  destruction  of  thy 
people  and  their  territory. 

"  Fourteen  thousand  titans  of  dreadful  deeds  with  Khara 
and  Dushana  have  been  slain  by  Rama  single-handed ;  Rama 
of  imperishable  exploits  has  freed  the  ascetics  of  fear,  estab- 
lished peace  in  the  Dandaka  Forest  and  harassed  Janasthana, 
but  thou,  who  art  covetous  and  a  slave  to  lust,  art  unaware 
of  the  danger  that  threatens  thy  dominion.  None  will  help 
that  monarch  in  time  of  peril,  who  is  mean,  violent,  dissolute, 
haughty  and  perfidious.  5iven  his  own  relatives  will  overpower 
a  king  who  is  excessively  vain,  pretentious,  boastful  and  irascible. 
That  monarch  who  fails  in  his  duty  and,  under  the  threat  of 
danger  is  lulled  into  a  false  security,  will  in  time  of  adversity 
be  swept  from  his  kingdom  like  a  straw.  Dry  wood,  turf  or 
dust  have  some  value,  but  a  king  who  is  degenerate  is  worthless 
and  resembles  a  faded  wreath  or  a  worn-out  garment.  That 
monarch  who  is  vigilant  however,  conversant  with  what  is 
happening  and  virtuous,  establishes  his  throne  in  perpetuity. 
The  king  who,  even  while  sleeping,  is  yet  awake  to  the  ordering 
of  his  kingdom,  who  manifests  his  anger  or  approval  at  a  fitting 
time,  is  revered  by  all. 

"  O  Thou,  whose  emissaries  have  failed  to  inform  thee  of 
the  great  carnage  among  the  titans,  who  art  bereft  of  wisdom, 
O  Ravana,  thou  art  lacking  in  all  these  great  qualities. 

"  Disregarding  others,  given  up  to  the  pleasures  of  the 
senses,  not  able  to  reap  the  advantage  of  time  and  place  or 
ctiscriminate  between  what  is  good  and  evil,  having  sacrificed 
thy  kingdom*  thou  wilt  soon  perish." 

Reflecting  on  the  infirmities  his  sister  had  ascribed  to  him, 
Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  opulent,  arrogant  and  powerful, 
became  absorbed  in  thought

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    34 

Shurpanakha  urges  Ravana  to  slay  Rama  and  wed  Sita 

Hearing  Shurpanakha's  bitter  words,  Ravana  surrounded  by 
his  ministers  enquired  angrily  : — "  Who  is  Rama  ?  What, 
is  his  strength  ?  How  does  he  look  and  what  is  the  measure 
of  his  prowess  ?  Why  has  he  penetrated  into  the  lonely  and 
inaccessible  depths  of  the  Dandaka  Forest  ?  With  what  weapons 
did  he  destroy  the  titans  in  that  conflict,  slaying  Khara  and 
Dushana  as  also  Trishiras  ?  Tell  me  truly,  O  Lovely  One, 
who  has  disfigured  thee  ?  " 

Thus  addressed  by  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  Shurpanakha 
in  a  transport  of  rage  began  to  relate  the  history  of  Rama. 

She  said :  "  Rama,  the  son  of  King  Dasaratha,  resembles 
the  God  of  Love ;  his  arms  are  long,  his  eyes  large ;  clad  in 
robes  of  bark  and  a  black  antelope  skin,  bearing  a  bow  encircled 
with  gold  like  unto  Indra's,  he  lets  fly  blazing  arrows  resembling 
venomous  snakes.  Emitting  a  great  shout,  he  discharges  his 
formidable  shafts,  and  in  the  struggle  I  could  not  distinguish 
him  but  beheld  the  host  being  decimated  under  the  rain  of 
his  arrows,  as  the  harvest  is  destroyed  by  the  hail  sent  by 
Indra.  In  a  short  space,  single-handed,  standing  alone,  he 
slew  fourteen  thousand  titans  with  Khara  and  Dushana,  thus 
bringing  peace  to  the  sages  in  the  Dandaka  Forest  and  deliver- 
ing them  from  fear.  Chivalrous  of  soul,  Rama,  the  Knower  of 
Self,  would  not  countenance  the  slaying  of  a  woman  and, 
having  been  mutilated  at  his  command,  I  escaped. 

"  His  brother,  endowed  with  great  valour,  is  renowned  for 
his  virtue ;  his  name  is  Lakshmana  and  he  is  devoted  to  Rama. 
Full  of  fire,  indomitable,  victorious,  powerful,  intelligent  and 
wise,  he  is  his  right  hand  and  his  very  life's  breath.  And 
Rama's  virtuous,  tender  and  wedded  wife,  of  large  eyes,  whose 
face  resembles  the  full  moon,  is  ever  engaged  in  what  is  pleas- 
ing to  her  lord.  With  her  lovely  locks,  well-formed  nose, 
beautiful  shoulders  and  her  grace  and  dignity,  one  would  deem 
72 


ARANYA    KANDA 

her  to  be  a  forest  divinity  or  Lakshmi  herself.  With  a  skin 
of  the  colour  of  molten  gold,  nails  that  are  rosy  and  long, 
that  surpassingly  lovely  woman  is  Sita,  the  slender-waisted 
Princess  of  Videha.  No  woman  so  beautiful  has  ever  appeared 
in  the  world,  either  among  the  Gods,  Gandharvas,  Yakshas  or 
Kinneras.  He  whose  wife  Sita  becomes  and  whom  she  will 
warmly  embrace  will  live  in  the  world  more  happily  than 
Purandara.  With  her  natural  amiability,  her  marvellous 
beauty,  which  is  without  equal  on  earth,  she  would  prove  a 
worthy  consort  for  rhfe,  and  thou  too  art  fit  to  be  her  lord. 
It  was  to  bring  thee  this  lady  of  shapely  hips,  softly  rounded 
breasts  and  charming  features,  that  I  put  forth  my  endeavours, 
when,  O  Mighty-armed  One,  I  was  mutilated  by  the  ruthless 
Lakshmana ! 

"  When  thou  dost  behold  Vaidehi,  whose  countenance 
resembles  the  full  moon,  thou  shalt  instantly  be  pierced  with 
the  darts  of  the  God  of  Love.  If  thou  desirest  to  win  her, 
then  set  off  speedily  on  thy  right  foot  and  lay  siege  to  her 
heart.  If,  O  Ravana,  my  counsel  meets  with  thine  approval, 
then,  O  King  of  the  Titans,  follow  it  without  delay. 

"  Knowing  the  weakness  of  these  people,  O  Valiant  Chief 
of  the  Titans,  make  Sita,  who  is  without  blemish,  thy  consort. 
Hearing  that  Rama  with  his  arrows  that  never  missed  their 
mark  has  slain  the  titans  established  in  Janasthana,  and  of  the 
death  of  Khara  and  Dushana,  thou  hast  a  duty  to  perform." 


chapter   35 

Ravana  visits  the  Demon  Markka  once  more 

Hearing  the  words  of  Shurpanakha,  causing  his  hair  to  stand 
on  end,  Ravana  dismissed  his  ministers  and  began  to  reflect 
on  what  should  or  should  not  be  done.  Exploring  the  true 
significance  of  the  undertaking  and  weighing  the  desirability 
and  undesirability  of  the  matter,  he  came  to  the  conclusion 

73 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

'  Thus  should  I  act  *,  and,  fixed  in  his  resolve,  went  secretly 
to  the  splendid  pavilion  where  his  chariots  were  heldin readiness, 
commanding  his  driver  to  bring  out  his  car. 

At  his  order,  the  zealous  charioteer,  in  an  instant,  prepared 
that  superb  and  marvellous  chariot,  and  Havana  ascended  the 
golden  car  set  with  gems,  that  coursed  wheresoever  he  desired, 
to  which  mules  in  golden  trappings,  bearing  the  heads  of 
goblins,  were  harnessed. 

Mounted  on  that  chariot,  the  wheels  of  which  made  a  sound 
like  thunder,  the  younger  brother  of  Dhanada,  the  God  of 
Wealth,  proceeded  beside  the  Lord  of  Rivers  and  Streams 
along  the  seashore. 

Seated  under  a  pure-white  canopy  with  his  white  chanwaras, 
his  ten  heads  the  colour  of  lapis,  wearing  ornaments  of  pure 
gold,  with  ten  necks  and  twenty  arms,  the  younger  brother  of 
Dhanada,  the  enemy  of  the  Gods,  the  slayer  of  the  foremost 
among  the  ascetics,  possessed  of  huge  heads,  like  unto  the 
Indra  of  Mountains  with  its  ten  crests,  appeared  beautiful, 
standing  in  his  chariot,  coursing  at  will  like  a  mass  of  cloud, 
crowned  with  lightning  and  accompanied  by  a  flock  of  cranes. 

And  that  Great  One,  endowed  with  prowess,  beheld  the 
shores  of  the  sea  with  its  rocks  and  countless  trees,  laden  with 
fruit  and  flowers  of  every  kind,  bordered  by  lakes  of  limpid 
water  filled  with  lotuses,  and  spacious  hermitages  with  their 
altars  and  groves  of  plantain  trees  lending  brilliance  to  the 
scene,  which  was  enhanced  by  blossoming  Coconut,  Sala, 
Tala  and  Tamala  trees. 

These  places  had  been  rendered  illustrious  by  the  presence 
of  thousands  of  great  Rishis  of  rigid  penance  and  Nagas, 
Suparnas,  Gandharvas  and  Kinneras ;  they  were  rendered 
pleasant  by  Siddhas  and  Charanas,  who  were  fully  self-subdued 
and  those  descendants  of  Brahma  who  derived  their  nutriment 
from  the  solar  rays  and  those  who  lived  on  a  bare  subsistence 
such  as  the  Ajas,  Vaikhanasas,  Mashas,  Valakhilyas  and 
Marichipas.1  Countless  nymphs  of  celestial  beauty,  adorned 
with  garlands  and  jewels,  beguiled  them  with  every  kind  of 
pastime  in  which  they  excelled.,  and  the  auspicious  consorts  of 
the  Gods  honoured  them  by  dwelling  amongst  them,  whilst

74 


ARANYA    KANDA 

Danavas  and  other  Celestial  Beings  who  fed  on  Amrita  fre- 
quented that  place.  Swans,  cranes,  pelicans  and  waterfowl 
disported  themselves  on  the  emerald  sward,  wet  and  shining 
with  the  sea  mist;  spacious  cars  festooned  with  celestial 
garlands  from  which  strains  of  sweet  music  issued,  flew  here 
and  there  at  the  will  of  those  who  had  conquered  the  worlds 
by  their  austerities,  together  with  Gandharvas  and  Apsaras. 

Ravana  surveyed  countless  forests  of  sandalwood,  whose 
roots  were  full  of  fragrant  sap,  delighting  the  olfactory  sense, 
and  groves  of  excellent  Agallocha  and  Takkola  trees  with  pear 
trees  and  bushes  of  black  pepper  and  heaps  of  pearls  lying  on 
the  shore,  and  coral  reefs  and  gold  and  silver  promontories, 
tumbling  cataracts  of  crystal  water  and  cities  filled  with  grain 
and  treasure,  where  the  pearls  of  womanhood  could  be  seen 
and  which  were  thronged  with  horses,  elephants  and  chariots. 

On  the  shores  of  the  ocean,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans  beheld 
a  level  and  charming  spot  over  which  cool  breezes  blew 
resembling  heaven  itself,  in  the  centre  of  which  grew  a  great 
fig  tree,  like  a  bright  cloud,  where  many  sages  sheltered,  and 
on  every  side  its  branches  stretched  to  a  distance  of  several 
yojanas.  It  was  there  that  the  mighty  Garuda  brought  a  huge 
elephant  and  a  giant  tortoise  in  his  claws,  wishing  to  devour 
them  among  the  branches,  but  the  bough  broke  under  the 
weight  of  that  enormous  bird,  and  the  Vaikhanasas,  Mashas, 
Valakhilyas,  Marichipas  Ajas  and  Dhumras  being  assembled 
there,  Garuda  had  compassion  on  them  and  transported  the 
branch  together  with  the  elephant  and  tortoise  in  one  claw 
to  a  distance  of  one  hundred  yojanas,  where  that  excellent 
bird  regaled  himself  on  their  flesh. 

Destroying  the  empire  of  the  Nishadas  with  the  severed 
branch,  thus  delivering  the  sages,  his  joy  was  re-doubled  and 
his  energy  increased,  whereupon  filled  with  strength  he  resolved 
to  steal  the  Nectar  of  Immortality.  Having  broken  the  iron 
bars,  he  entered  the  jewelled  keep  and  bore  away  the  Amrita 
from  that  place  where  it  had  been  hidden  by  the  mighty  Indra. 

It  was  this  same  Nyagrodha  tree,  frequented  by  groups  of 
great  sages,  that  still  bore  the  marks  of  Suparna  and  was  called 
'  Subhadra  *,  that  the  younger  brother  of  Dhanada  now  saw 
before  him. 

75 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Passing  over  to  the  further  side  of  that  Lord  of  the  Waters, 
the  Ocean,  Ravana  saw  a  solitary  hermitage,  an  ancient  and 
holy  retreat  in  the  middle  of  a  forest.  There  he  found  the 
Demon  Maricha  clad  in  a  black  antelope  skin,  wearing  matted 
locks  and  given  up  to  the  practice  of  asceticism. 

Ravana  having  approached  him,  Maricha,  according  to 
tradition,  entertained  him  in  many  ways  not  known  to  man. 
Placing  pure  food  and  water  before  his  sovereign,  he  humbly 
addressed  him  saying : — 

"  Is  all  well  with  Lanka,  O  Chief  of  the  Titans  ?  With  what 
purpose  hast  thou  come  hither  again  so  speedily  ?  " 

On  hearing  this  enquiry,  the  mighty  and  eloquent  Ravana 
answered  in  this  wise : — 


chapter   36 

Ravana  reveals  his  Project  to  the  Demon  Maricha 

"  O  Maricha,  listen  to  me  as  I  relate  everything  to  thee  !  O 
My  Child,  I  am  deeply  afflicted  and  thou  alone  canst  temper 
my  distress  ! 

"  Thou  art  conversant  with  Janasthana,  it  was  there  that  my 
brother  Khara,  the  long-armed  Dushana,  my  sister  Shur- 
panakha  and  the  powerful  Trishiras  and  other  flesh-eating 
titans,  prowlers  of  the  night,  had  at  my  command  taken  up 
their  residence,  in  order  to  harass  the  sages  in  that  vast  forest, 
who  were  engaged  in  their  austerities. 

"  Fourteen  thousand  titans  of  terrible  deeds,  full  of  courage 
and  supremely  skilled,  dwelt  in  Janasthana  under  the  leadership 
of  Khara.  These  powerful  warriors  assembled  there,  met 
with  Rama  in  the  field.  Furnished  with  every  kind  of  weapon, 
clad  in  mail,  and  headed  by  Khara,  they  were  assailed  by  the 
infuriated  Rama,  without  a  single  provocative  word  having 
been  uttered,  who  directed  the  arrows  of  his  bow  against 
them,  and  under  the  fiery  darts  of  a  mere  mortal,  fighting 
single-handed  and  on  foot,  those  fourteen  thousand  titans  of 
great  prowess  fell ;  Khara  perished  in  that  struggle  and  Dushana 
76 


ARANYA    KANDA 

was  laid  low  with  Trishiras  also  j  peace  was  thus  established  in 
the  Dandaka  Forest. 

"  Having  been  exiled  to  the  forest  with  his  wife  by  an  out- 
raged sire,  that  insignificant  mortal,  Rama,  the  obloquy  of  the 
warrior  class,  a  man  without  moral  principle,  ruthless, 
passionate,  fanatical,  acquisitive  and  a  slave  to  his  senses, 
dwells  in  his  hermitage,  having  forsworn  his  duty.  Essentially 
unjust,  seeking  to  harm  others  without  cause,  depending  on 
his  own  strength  alone,  he  has  mutilated  my  sister  by  cutting 
off  her  ears  and  nose. 

"  I  have  resolved  to  carry  off  his  consort,  Ska,  by  force,  who 
resembles  a  daughter  of  the  Gods,  and  I  now  solicit  thine  aid 
in  this  undertaking.  O  Hero,  I  with  my  brothers  have  nothing 
to  fear  from  the  Gods,  therefore  do  thou  accompany  me  as 
a  loyal  ally;  O  Titan;  thou  hast  no  equal  in  pride  and  courage 
in  battle  and  in  strategy ;  thou  art  also  a  master,  being  versed 
in  the  laws  of  magic. 

"  Learn  from  me  how  thou  canst  best  assist  me !  Assuming 
the  form  of  a  golden  deer,  flecked  with  silver,  do  thou  pass  to 
and  fro  near  Rama's  hermitage  in  the  presence  of  Sita.  Seeing 
that  lovely  doe,  assuredly  Sita  will  say  to  her  lord  and 
Lakshmana  : — '  Do  ye  capture  it !  * 

"  When  they  are  far  distant  and,  by  good  fortune,  Sita  is 
left  alone,  I  shall  bear  her  away  without  hindrance,  as  Rahu 
devours  the  splendour  of  the  moon.  The  abduction  of  his 
consort  will  cause  Rama  to  die  of  grief,  and  I  shall  regain  my 
happiness  and  security  in  a  heart  wholly  satisfied !  " 

Hearing  these  words  concerning  Sita,  the  benevolent  features 
of  Maricha  wilted  with  terror  and,  passing  his  tongue  over 
his  dry  lips,  with  a  fixed  gaze  like  unto  one  dead,  he  regarded 
Ravana.  Filled  with  dread,  knowing  well  the  defence  of  the 
forest  to  be  valiantly  upheld  by  Rama,  with  joined  palms 
Maricha  addressed  Ravana  in  words  tending  to  his  welfare : — 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     3  7 

Markka  seeks  to  persuade  Ravana  from  his  Purpose 

Hearing  the  words  of  that  Sovereign  of  the  Titans,  the  wise 
and  eloquent  Maricha  answered  him,  saying : — 

"  O  King,  those  who  have  recourse  to  flattery  are  easy  to 
find,  but  rare  are  those  who  are  willing  to  listen  to  that  speech 
which  is  severe  yet  salutory.  Assuredly  thou  dost  not  know 
Rama  and  art  not  conversant  with  his  great  qualities,  which 
equal  those  of  Mahendra  and  Varuna. 

"  Thou  art  thoughtless  and  thy  spies  are  incompetent ;  how 
canst  thou  dwell  in  security  with  thy  titans,  O  Friend  ?  Is 
not  Rama  in  his  wrath  able  to  rid  the  world  of  titans  ?  Will 
not  the  daughter  of  Janaka  prove  to  be  that  which  will  determine 
thy  death  ?  Will  not  Sita  become  the  cause  of  a  great  catastrophe? 
"  Will  not  the  city  of  Lanka  perish  with  thee  and  thy  titans, 
since  it  has  thee  who  followest  the  dictates  of  thy  passions, 
who  art  a  slave  to  thy  senses  and  who  knowest  no  restraint, 
as  its  lord  ?  An  unprincipled  monarch,  such  as  thou,  is  the 
slave  of  his  desires  and  in  his  perversity  heeds  only  evil  counsels, 
thus  placing  his  subjects  and  his  kingdom  in  jeopardy. 

"  Rama  has  neither  been  disowned  by  his  sire,  nor  is  he 
unfaithful  to  his  duty,  nor  is  he  avaricious  nor  wicked,  nor  the 
obloquy  of  the  warrior  caste.  The  son  of  Kaushalya  is  neither 
void  of  loyalty  nor  of  other  virtues,  nor  is  he  given  to  anger, 
nor  does  he  seek  to  harm  others.  Knowing  his  father  to  be 
deceived  by  Kaikeyi,  yet  filled  with  filial  devotion  he  said  '  I 
will  redeem  his  pledge '  and  went  into  exile  to  the  forest. 
To  please  Kaikeyi  and  his  father  Dasaratha,  he  renounced  his 
throne  and  prerogatives  in  order  to  enter  the  Dandaka  Forest. 
Rama  is  neither  passionate  nor  is  he  an  ignorant  man,  whose 
senses  are  unsubdued ;  what  has  been  related  to  thee  is  false 
and  should  never  have  been  uttered.  Rama  is  duty  personified; 
he  is  virtuous,  and  this  great  hero  is  the  Lord  of  the  World, 
as  Indra  is  the  Chief  of  the  Gods.  By  virtue  of  her  chastity  and 
her  devotion,  Vaidehi  protects  Rama  as  Prabha  the  Sun,  how 
78 


ARANYA    KANDA 

canst  thou  think  of  bearing  her  away  by  force  ?  Do  not  enter 
the  inextinguishable  fire  of  Rama,  who  on  the  battlefield 
employs  his  shafts  as  names  and  his  bow  as  fuel.  No  matter 
how  great  thine  anger,  it  behoveth  thee  not  to  approach  that 
invincible  warrior,  bearing  his  bow,  his  countenance  inflamed 
with  ire,  furnished  with  every  weapon,  the  Destroyer  of  his 
Foes ! 

"  Unless  thou  art  willing  to  forfeit  thy  kingdom,  thine 
happiness  and  life  itself,  that  is  dear  to  all,  do  not  approach 
Rama,  who  resembles  Antaka  himself.  How  canst  thou  bear 
away  the  daughter  of  Janaka  from  the  forest,  who  is  protected 
by  Rama's  bow  of  immeasurable  power  ?  The  beloved  spouse 
of  that  Lion  among  Men,  whose  chest  is  broad,  is  dearer  to 
him  than  his  own  life,  and  she  is  wholly  devoted  to  him.  The 
Princess  of  Mithila  of  slender  waist  will  never  be  torn  from 
the  arms  of  that  great  warrior  who  resembles  a  flame  in  a  lit 
brazier. 

"  Why  enter  upon  such  a  vain  endeavour,  O  Great  King  ? 
Should  Rama  single  thee  out  on  the  battlefield,  all  would  be 
over  with  thee.  Since  it  concerns  thy  life,  thy  fortune  and 
thy  kingdom,  heretofore  invincible,  take  counsel  with  thy 
ministers  with  Bibishana  at  their  head.  In  honour  reflect  and 
weigh  carefully  the  merits  and  demerits,  gain  and  loss,  of  this 
matter.  Compare  thy  valour  with  that  of  Raghava !  Con- 
sider what  is  to  thine  advantage  and  then  do  what  thou  thinkest 
right.  It  does  not  appear  fitting  to  me,  that  thou  shouldst 
meet  the  son  of  the  King  of  Koshala  on  the  battlefield.  I 
counsel  thee  for  thine  own  good,  O  King  of  the  Night  Rangers!"

Maricha  describes  his  first  Encounter  with  Rama 

"  O  King,  formerly  I  possessed  great  powers  and  ranged  the 
earth  in  a  body  resembling  a  mountain,  endowed  with  the 
strength  of  a  thousand  elephants.  In  colour  like  a  dark  cloud, 
wearing  bracelets  of  fine  gold,  my  brow  encircled  by  a  diadem,

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

armed  with  a  club,  I  sowed  terror  in  the  hearts  of  all  creatures. 
"  Wandering  in  the  Dandaka  Forest,  I  fed  on  the  flesh  of 
ascetics,  and  the  great  and  virtuous  Sage  Vishwamitra,  alarmed, 
went  in  person  to  King  Dasaratha  and  addressed  that  Indra 
among  men,  saying : — '  Let  Rama  protect  me  with  vigilance 
on  the  day  of  sacrifice !  O  Chief  of  Men,  I  fear  Maricha 
exceedingly.' 

"  To  these  words,  the  righteous  monarch  Dasaratha  answered 
that  illustrious  ascetic,  Vishwamitra,  saying : — '  Raghava  is  not 
yet  twelve  years  old  and  is  not  skilled  in  the  use  of  weapons, 
but  I  myself  will  lead  an  army  composed  of  four  angas1  against 
those  Prowlers  of  the  Night,  O  Thou  Best  of  Ascetics  and  will 
destroy  thine  adversary  in  accord  with  thy  desire  ! ' 
"  Thus  addressed  by  the  King,  Vishwamitra  answered  : — 
"  *  Verily  thou  wert  the  refuge  of  the  Gods  and  thine  exploits 
are  renowned  in  the  Three  Worlds,  yet,  however  powerful 
thine  army,  none  but  Rama  on  this  earth  has  the  power  to 
overcome  these  demons.  Do  thou  therefore  remain  here,  O 
Scourge  of  Thy  Foes !  Though  still  a  child,  Rama  is  fully 
able  to  subdue  the  demons,  I  shall  therefore  take  him  with 
me ;  may  all  be  well  with  thee  ! ' 

"  Having  spoken  thus,  the  Sage  Vishwamitra,  highly  gratified, 
took  the  king's  son  with  him  to  his  hermitage. 

"  In  the  forest  of  Dandaka  he  initiated  the  traditional  sacrifices, 
whilst  Rama,  with  his  bow  strung  in  readiness,  remained  close 
at  hand.  Yet  a  child,  with  his  dark  skin  of  bluish  hue  and  his 
shining  glances,  clothed  in  a  simple  tunic,  bearing  his  bow, 
his  locks  tied  in  a  knot,  wearing  a  golden  chain,  he  illumined 
the  Dandaka  Forest  with  his  radiance,  like  unto  the  new  moon 
about  to  rise. 

"  At  that  instant,  full  of  power  and  proud  of  the  boons  won 
from  Brahma,  shining  like  a  cloud  and  wearing  golden  earrings, 
I  entered  the  hermitage.  Seeing  me,  Rama  took  up  his 
arrow  and  placed  it  on  the  string  of  his  bow  with  care.  In 
mine  ignorance  I  passed  him  by,  deeming  him  to  be  but  a 
child  and  rushed  towards  the  altar  where  Vishwamitra  stood. 
Thereupon  Rama  let  loose  a  sharp  arrow  fatal  to  his  foes, 
and  striking  me,  hurled  me  into  the  sea,  a  distance  of  a  hundred 

1  Divisions — see  Glossary. 


ARANYA    KANDA 

yojanas  !  O  Friend,  the  valiant  Rama,  having  no  wish  to  kill 
me,  spared  my  life,  but  overwhelmed  by  the  violence  of  the 
blow  I  lost  consciousness  and  was  thrown  into  the  depths  of 
the  sea.  After  a  long  while,  recovering  my  senses,  I  returned 
to  Lanka.  Though  my  life  had  been  spared,  yet  my  companions, 
who  went  to  mine  aid  were  all  slain  by  the  child  Rama  of 
imperishable  deeds,  who  proved  himself  a  master  in  the  science 
of  archery. 

"  If,  setting  me  aside,  thou  dost  pit  thyself  against  him,  then 
thou  shalt  surely  draw  down  an  immediate,  dreadful  and 
inescapable  retribution,  not  to  be  eschewed. 

"  The  titans  who  know  of  nought  but  diversions  and  enter- 
tainments of  every  kind  and  who  dream  only  of  assemblies  and 
festivities  will  be  plunged  in  fruitless  misery. 

"  On  account  of  Sita,  the  City  of  Lanka,  with  its  temples 
and  palaces,  encrusted  with  every  kind  of  gem,  will  be  razed 
to  the  ground  under  thine  eyes. 

"  Even  those  who  are  pious  and  innocent,  suffer  for  the 
misdeeds  of  others  through  their  contact,  as  fish  in  a  snake* 
infested  lake. 

"  Their  limbs  perfumed  with  divine  sandal-paste,  wearing 
celestial  ornaments,  thou  shalt  see  the  titans  lying  on  the  earth 
on  account  of  thy  folly.  The  survivors  with  their  consorts, 
save  those  who  have  been  borne  away,  will  flee  in  all  directions, 
unable  to  find  refuge.  Under  a  hail  of  arrows,  ringed  in 
flames,  thou  shalt  see  the  edifices  of  Lanka  burnt  to  ashes. 

"  O  King,  there  is  no  greater  sin  than  consorting  with 
another's  wife;  thou  hast  thousands  of  concubines  in  thy 
train ;  therefore,  cleaving  to  thy  lawful  consorts,  preserve  thy 
line,  thine  honour,  fortune,  kingdom  and  thy  life.  If  thou 
desirest  to  live  happily  with  thy  wives  and  friends,  do  not  enter 
into  conflict  with  Rama. 

"  If,  despite  my  friendly  counsels,  thou  dost  bear  Sita  away 
by  force,  then  thou  and  thy  kinsmen,  together  with  thine 
whole  army  will  surely  descend  to  the  region  of  Yama  under 
Rama's  deadly  shafts." 


THE    RAA1AYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    39 

Marietta  again  seeks  to  dissuade  Ravana  from  pursuing  his  Design 

"  O  Ravana  I  have  told  thee  how  my  life  was  spared ;  now 
hear  what  happened  further. 

"  X  was  in  no  way  daunted  by  this  event  and,  accompanied 
by  two  demons,  I  entered  the  forest  of  Dandaka  disguised  as 
a  deer.  There  I  roamed  about  living  on  the  flesh  of  ascetics, 
visiting  the  sacred  retreats,  the  sacrificial  fires  and  places  of 
worship,  sowing  terror  amongst  the  sages,  whom  I  persecuted. 
Growing  exceedingly  rapacious,  I  slew  those  ascetics,  drinking 
their  blood  and  devouring  their  flesh,  my  cruelty  rendering 
me  the  terror  of  all  the  inhabitants  of  the  forest. 

"  As  I  roamed  here  and  there  throwing  obstacles  in  the 
way  of  the  religious  rites,  Z  encountered  Rama  living  a  life  of 
asceticism  with  the  blessed  Sita  and  the  mighty  Lakshmana, 
engaged  in  pious  practices  and  devoted  to  the  welfare  of  all. 

"  Filled  with  contempt  for  the  mighty  Rama,  who  had 
retired  to  the  forest,  and  reflecting :  (  So  he  has  now  become 
an  ascetic,'  I,  remembering  my  former  defeat,  rilled  with 
anger,  rushed  at  him  with  lowered  horns,  in  my  folly  desiring 
to  kill  him.  But  he,  swift  as  Suparna  or  Anila,  drawing  his 
great  bow,  loosed  three  sharp  and  deadly  arrows,  and  these 
dread  shafts  with  burnished  points  resembling  lightning,  flew 
off  as  one,  thirsting  for  blood. 

"  Knowing  Rama's  skill  and  prowess  from  former  times  and 
.recognising  the  peril  in  which  I  stood,  I  ran  away  and  escaped, 
but  the  two  titans  who  accompanied  me  were  slain.  Having 
with  supreme  difficulty  evaded  Rama's  arrows  thus  preserving 
my  life,  I  retired  to  this  place,  adopting  the  path  of  an  ascetic 
and  practising  Yoga.  From  that  day,  I  behold  Rama,  clothed 
in  bark,  wearing  a  black  antelope  skin,  bearing  his  bow,  in 
every  tree,  like  unto  the  God  of  Death  himself  carrying  his 
noose !  In  my  terror,  I  see  thousands  of  Ramas,  O  Ravana  I 
The  whole  forest  assumes  the  form  of  Rama  and  even  in 

82 


ARANYA    KANDA 

deserted  places  I  behold  him  .'  O  Chief  of  the  Titans,  in  sleep 
also  he  appear  to  me  and  I  start  up  in  fear.  Such  is  the  terror 
he  inspires  in  me,  that  even  those  words  beginning  with  the 
syllable  *  Ra ',  such  as  *  Ratna  ']  and  *  Ratha  V  fill  me  with 
alarm. 

"  Having  recognized  the  prowess  of  that  descendant  of  Raghu, 
I  am  persuaded  that  thou  art  not  able  to  withstand  him  in 
combat,  when  even  Bali  and  Namuchi  succumbed  to  him. 
Whether  thou  dost  enter  into  conflict  with  him  or  makest  thy 
peace,  do  not  speak  his  name  to  me,  if  thou  wouldst  see  me  live! 

"  In  this  world,  there  are  countless  virtuous  souls  engaged 
in  the  practice  of  Yoga,  fulfilling  their  every  duty,  who  yet 
perish  with  those  about  them  through  another's  fault.  I  too, 
therefore,  should  be  doomed  to  die  for  another's  misdeeds ! 
O  Ranger  of  the  Night,  do  what  thou  deemest  to  be  right, 
but  follow  thee  I  will  not.  Truly  Rama,  who  is  full  of  zeal, 
courage  and  prowess,  will  prove  to  be  the  destroyer  of  the 
titans  of  this  world.  Though  the  wicked-minded  Khara  of 
Janasthana  was  slain  by  him  on  account  of  Shurpanakha, 
how,  in  truth,  is  he  to  blame  for  that  ? 

"  I  have  uttered  these  words  for  thy  good  and  the  good  of 
thy  kinsmen ;  if  thou  disregardest  them,  thou  and  thy  people 
will  assuredly  perish  in  combat  with  Rama !  "

Havana's  Wrath 

As  one  about  to  die  refuses  a  remedy,  so  did  Ravana  repudiate 
Maricha's  judicious  and  opportune  words  and,  having  listened 
to  this  salutory  discourse,  replied  in  harsh  and  ill-considered 
accents,  saying : — 

"  Thou  Wretch,  what  thou  hast  spoken  will  bear  no  fruit, 
as  seed  that  is  sown  on  barren  soil  comes  to  nought,  nor  will 
it  alter  my  determination  to  enter  into  combat  with  Rama, 
who  is  but  a  witless  and  insignificant  creature.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  In  thy  presence  I  shall  bear  away  the  beloved  wife  of 
Rama,  the  slayer  of  Khara,  who  has  renounced  father,  mother, 
kingdom  and  friends  for  a  woman  of  no  account.  O  Maricha, 
my  mind  is  fixed ;  neither  Gods  nor  titans  nor  Indra  himself 
can  alter  my  resolve. 

"  It  is  proper,  when  asked,  to  put  forward  the  advantages 
and  disadvantages  of  a  project  and  what  will  best  serve  or 
injure  a  purpose ;  a  wise  minister,  questioned  by  his  sovereign, 
seeking  his  master's  good,  will  answer  with  due  deference, 
standing  before  him  with  joined  palms,  in  words  fitting  to  the 
occasion,  but  a  gloomy  discourse  does  not  please  a  monarch, 
who,  having  regard  to  his  dignity,  is  thereby  affronted. 

"  Kings  of  limitless  power  represent  the  five  Gods  :  Agni, 
Indra,  Soma,  Yama  and  Varuna,  symbolising  ardour,  valour, 
gentleness,  retribution  and  forgiveness ;  therefore  at  all  times 
they  should  be  honoured  and  revered.  Thou,  nevertheless, 
disregarding  thy  duty,  dost  only  manifest  arrogance.  Thou  to 
whom  I  have  come  as  a  guest  hast  treated  me  as  a  miscreant. 
I  have  not  consulted  thee  regarding  what  is  expedient  or 
proper,  O  Titan,  I  ask  thee  for  thy  support  in  this  enterprise. 
Hear  how  thou  canst  assist  me. 

"  Assuming  the  form  of  a  golden  deer  studded  with  silver, 
proceed  to  Rama's  hermitage  and  pass  to  and  fro  before 
Vaidehi ;  after  captivating  her,  thou  canst  depart.  Seeing  thee 
transformed  into  a  deer  by  thy  magic  power,  Vaidehi  struck 
with  wonder,  will  instantly  call  on  Rama  to  capture  thee. 
When  Kakutstha  is  far  away,  having  left  the  hermitage,  do 
thou,  imitating  his  voice,  utter  such  cries  as :  '  O  Sita  !  O 
Lakshmana  !  ' 

"  At  this  call,  urged  on  by  Sita,  Saumitri,  in  fraternal  love, 
being  perturbed,  will  hastily  follow  in  Rama's  wake.  Kakutstha 
and  Lakshmana  being  both  far  distant,  I  shall  bear  Sita  away, 
as  the  thousand-eyed  God  carried  off  Sachi.  Having  accom- 
plished this  according  to  my  design,  I  shall  confer  half  my 
kingdom  on  thee,  O  Titan. 

H  O  Friend,  do  thou  pursue  the  path  which  leads  to  the 

success  of  this  enterprise  and  I  will  follow  in  my  chariot. 

Obtaining  possession  of  Sita  without  a  struggle  by  deceiving 

Rama,  I  shall  return  to  Lanka  with  thee,  my  purpose  fulfilled.

ARANYA    KANDA 

"  If  thou  dost  not  obey  me,  even  against  thine  inclination, 
O  Maricha,  I  shall  slay  thee  instantly !  I  shall  compel  thee! 
None  can  attain  happiness  and  prosperity  by  opposing  his 
sovereign's  will.  Verily  by  coming  before  Rama  thou  dost  risk 
thy  life,  but  certain  death  awaits  thee  if  thou  oppose  me; 
therefore  reflect  carefully  on  what  is  most  expedient,  and  do 
what  thou  deemest  proper." 


chapter   41 

Maricha  counsels  Havana  further 

Thus  commanded  by  the  imperious  King  of  the  Titans, 
Maricha  replied  in  bold  and  fearless  tones,  saying  : — 

"  What  wretch  has  counselled  thee  to  take  this  course,  which 
will  lead  to  thine  extinction,  together  with  thy  children,  thy 
kingdom  and  thy  counsellors,  O  Ranger  of  the  Night?  O 
King,  who  is  that  evil  person,  envious  of  thy  good  fortune, 
who  seeks  to  open  the  portals  of  death  to  thee  ?  Assuredly  he 
is  thine  enemy,  who  in  his  impotence  plots  thy  defeat  under 
the  blows  of  a  superior  antagonist.  What  miscreant  of  evil 
intent  seeks  to  propel  thee  along  the  path  of  self-destruction  ? 
The  counsellors,  who  do  not  dissuade  thee  from  thy  fell  design, 
merit  death  and  yet  live.  Upright  ministers  ever  restrain  a 
king,  who  following  his  own  desires,  enters  on  an  evil  path. 
Thou  who  should  thus  be  guided  art  blind. 

"  By  the  grace  of  their  sovereign,  ministers  attain  justice, 
profit,  pleasure  and  renown,  but  these  objects  are  never  found, 
O  Ravana,  if  a  king  be  lacking  in  virtue,  and  his  people  suffer 
nought  but  misfortune. 

"  O  Thou,  Foremost  of  Conquerors,  the  king  is  the  root  of 
the  righteousness  and  good  repute  of  his  subjects,  he  should 
therefore  always  be  protected  by  them.  No  kingdom  survives 
under  a  sovereign  who  is  violent,  overbearing  and  intemperate, 
O  Ranger  of  the  Night.  Those  ministers  who  counsel  violence 
perish  with  their  chief,  as  a  chariot  is  precipitated  into  an 
abyss  by  a  reckless  driver.  Many  pious  persons  in  this  world, 
85 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

engaged  in  their  duties,  have  met  with  destruction  with  their 
relatives  through  the  fault  of  others.  A  cruel  despot  is  as  unable 
to  protect  his  subjects  as  a  jackal  is  unable  to  defend  a  herd 
of  deer.  The  titans,  whose  lord  thou  art,  foolish,  ruthless  and 
a  slave  to  thy  passions,  are  doomed. 

"It  is  not  I  who  should  be  pitied  for  this  unexpected 
calamity  that  has  overtaken  me,  but  thou,  who  with  thine 
army  will  soon  meet  with  destruction.  Having  been  struck 
down  by  Rama,  he  will  speedily  despatch  thee.  My  mission 
accomplished,  I  shall  meet  my  death  under  the  blows  of  thine 
adversary.  Rest  assured  that  I  shall  perish  as  soon  as  I  appear 
before  Rama  and  know  well  that  the  abduction  of  Sita  will 
cost  thee  thy  life  as  well  as  that  of  thy  kinsmen. 

"  If  thou  succeedest  in  bearing  Sita  away  from  the  hermitage 
with  mine  aid,  it  is  the  end  of  thee,  of  Lanka  and  of  the  titans. 

"  Though  seeking  thy  good  and  desiring  to  be  of  assistance 
to  thee,  thou  dost  disregard  my  words,  as  those  for  whom  the 
last  hour  has  struck  do  not  heed  the  counsel  of  their  friends." 


CHAPTER     42 

Marietta   assuming  the  form  of  a  Deer  goes  to  the  Hermitage 

Having  addressed  these  bitter  words  to  Ravana,  Maricha,  full 
of  apprehension,  said : — "  Let  us  go,  but  know  that  when  I 
come  before  that  warrior  furnished  with  arrows,  sword  and 
bow,  which  he  will  wield  to  my  destruction,  my  life  is  forfeit ! 
Nay,  he  who  opposes  Rama  will  not  return  alive !  For  thee 
he  will  prove  the  Rod  of  Death  and  thou  shalt  fall  beneath  his 
blows.  In  what  way  can  I  further  thine  evil  design  ?  Yet 
I  will  go.    May  prosperity  attend  thee,  O  Ranger  of  the  Night!  " 

Highly  gratified  by  these  words,  Ravana,  embracing  him 
warmly,  addressed  him  in  honeyed  accents,  saying : — 

"  This  magnanimity  is  worthy  of  thee ;   now  that  thou  art 

willing  to  accede  to  my  request  I  know  thee  truly  to  be  Maricha; 

heretofore  another  demon  addressed  me.    Do  thou  with  me 

ascend  my  winged  chariot,  encrusted  with  gems,  to  which 

86 


ARANYA    KANDA 

mules  with  goblins'  heads  are  harnessed.  Having  captivated 
Vaidehi  in  accord  with  my  desire,  fly  thence,  and  she,  being 
left  alone,  will  be  forcibly  borne  away  by  me." 

"  Be  it  so  ",  answered  Tataka's  son,  whereupon  Ravana 
mounted  the  chariot  resembling  a  celestial  car,  and  leaving  that 
solitary  place  set  out  with  all  speed.  Looking  down  on  many 
villages,  forests,  mountains,  rivers,  kingdoms  and  cities,  they 
finally  reached  the  forest  of  Dandaka  in  which  Rama's  hermitage 
stood.  Descending  from  the  golden  car,  the  Lord  of  the 
Titans,  accompanied  by  Maricha,  beheld  Rama's  retreat  and 
taking  that  demon  by  the  hand,  Ravana  said  to  him : — 

"  Here  is  Rama's  hermitage  shaded  by  palm  trees ;  now 
accomplish  the  purpose  for  which  we  have  come  hither." 

Hearing  Ravana's  words,  Maricha  in  an  instant  transformed 
himself  into  a  deer  and  began  to  pace  to  and  fro  before  Rama's 
hermitage. 

Assuming  a  marvellous  form,  wonderful  to  behold,  the 
points  of  his  horns  studded  with  gems,  his  skin  dappled,  his 
mouth  like  a  red  lotus,  his  ears  azure-tinted,  his  neck  out- 
stretched, his  belly  of  a  sapphire  hue,  his  hanks  the  colour  of 
the  Madhuka  flower,  shining  like  the  filaments  of  the  Kanja 
flower,  his  hoofs  like  emerald,  his  legs  slender  and  well- 
proportioned,  his  haunches  gleaming  with  all  the  colours  of 
the  rainbow,  that  demon  in  an  instant  had  become  a  ravishing 
gazelle  of  iridescent  hue,  studded  with  every  kind  of  gem,  of 
exceeding  beauty.  The  whole  forest  and  Rama's  enchanting 
retreat  were  rilled  with  the  radiance  of  that  form,  wonderful 
to  behold,  that  had  been  assumed  by  the  titan. 

In  order  to  capture  the  glances  of  Vaidehi  with  his  shimmering 
colours,  he  strayed  here  and  there  in  the  grass  among  the 
flowers.  His  skin  was  stippled  with  hundreds  of  silver  spots, 
giving  him  an  enchanting  appearance,  as  he  wandered  about 
nibbling  the  green  shoots  of  the  trees. 

Approaching  the  circle  of  palm  trees,  he  passed  slowly  here 
and  there  between  the  Karnikara  trees  in  the  hermitage,  some- 
times appearing  in  full  view  of  Sita.  That  charming  fawn  of 
many  colours  strayed  hither  and  thither  in  the  vicinity  of 
Rama's  ashrama,  coming  and  going  at  will,  sometimes  dis- 
appearing into  the  distance,  then  drawing  near  again,  gambolling 
87 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

playfully,  thereafter  crouching  on  the  earth,  or  following  a 
herd  of  deer ;  then  again  it  would  appear  at  their  head,  and 
by  every  means  this  titan,  in  the  form  of  a  gazelle  describing 
a  thousand  frolicsome  circles,  sought  to  attract  the  attention 
of  Sita.  The  other  fawns,  approaching,  snuffed  its  scent 
and  then  scattered  in  all  directions,  but  that  demon,  who 
formerly  had  taken  delight  in  slaying  them,  now,  in  order 
not  to  betray  his  real  nature,  abstained  from  molesting  those 
who  approached  him. 

Meantime  Vaidehi  of  brilliant  glances  was  engaged  in 
gathering  flowers,  diverting  herself  in  the  midst  of  the  Karnikara, 
Ashoka  and  Cuta  trees  that  she  loved  so  well.  As  she  wandered 
here  and  there  plucking  the  blossoms,  that  princess  of  tender 
looks,  who  did  not  merit  exile  in  the  forest,  saw  before  her  the 
fawn  studded  with  precious  gems,  its  limbs  encrusted  with 
diamonds  and  pearls.  Beholding  that  doe,  with  its  beautiful 
teeth  and  tips,  its  skin  the  colour  of  silver,  the  slender-waisted 
Sita  opened  her  eyes  wide  in  wonder  and  delight,  and  the 
marvellous  fawn,  seeing  Rama's  beloved  consort,  continued  to 
pace  to  and  fro  before  her,  illumining  the  forest.  Looking  at 
that  deer,  never  before  seen  by  man,  Sita,  the  daughter  of 
Janaka,  was  amazed. 


CHAPTER     43 

Sita  is  enamoured  of  the  Fawn 

Then  the  lovely  Sita,  of  flawless  limbs  and  skin  of  a  pure 
golden  hue,  gathering  flowers,  beheld  that  ravishing  fawn  with 
gold  and  silver  flanks,  and  highly  delighted  called  to  her  Lord 
and  Lakshmana,  who  were  furnished  with  weapons,  saying  : — 
"  O  Prince,  do  thou  come  quickly  with  thy  younger  brother !  " 
Thus  she  cried  again  and  again,  while  continuing  to  watch  the 
deer,  and  at  her  call  those  two  lions  among  men,  Rama  and 
Lakshmana  turned  their  eyes  in  that  direction  and  beheld  the 
fawn. 

88 


ARANYA    KANDA 

Astounded,  Lakshmana  exclaimed : — "  Undoubtedly  the 
titan  Maricha  has  assumed  the  form  of  a  deer.  Kings  who 
hunt  in  the  forest,  lured  by  this  deceptive  snape,  are  slain  by 
him  and,  O  Rama,  this  brilliant  fawn,  whose  radiance  rivals 
the  sun,  is  the  device  of  a  magician ;  such  a  deer  does  not 
exist  on  earth,  O  Master  of  the  World,  it  is  an  illusion,  born 
of  cunning." 

As  Lakshmana  was  speaking  thus,  Sita  with  a  delighted 
smile  interrupted  him  and  being  wholly  captivated  by  this 
phantom,  said : — 

"  O  Son  of  a  King,  this  marvellous  fawn  has  taken  possession 
of  my  heart ;  take  it  captive,  O  Great  Warrior,  it  will  serve  as 
a  plaything.  Many  beautiful  creatures,  lovely  to  look  upon, 
range  the  forest  in  the  vicinity  of  our  hermitage,  such  as 
Chamaras,  Srimaras  and  Rikshas,  while  troops  of  Prishatas, 
Vanaras  and  Kinneras  disport  themselves  here,  but  O  Long- 
armed  Heroes  full  of  grace  and  strength,  I  have  never  seen 
a  wild  creature  whose  brilliance  and  gentle  nimble  ways  are 
equal  to  this  wonderful  fawn's.  With  its  slender  many-coloured 
body  encrusted  with  gems,  it  illumines  the  whole  forest  around 
me  with  a  lustre  resembling  the  moon's.  What  beauty ! 
What  resplendence !  What  grace !  What  radiance !  This 
marvellous  fawn  with  its  graceful  limbs  possesses  me  utterly. 
If  thou  art  able  to  capture  it  alive,  it  will  prove  an  object  of 
supreme  wonder  in  the  hermitage  and  when  our  exile  is  over 
it  will  be  an  ornament  to  the  palace  of  the  queens. 

"  O  Lord !  Prince  Bharata  and  my  mothers,  seeing  this 
celestially  beautiful  deer,  will  be  struck  with  amazement.  If 
thou  art  not  able  to  capture  this  wonderful  fawn  alive,  its 
skin  will  be  most  precious,  O  Lion  among  Men.  I  shall  delight 
to  sit  on  its  golden  hide,  strewn  with  kusha  grass.  I  crave 
pardon  if  this  cruel  wish  may  seem  unworthy  of  a  woman, 
but  the  beauty  of  the  deer  excites  my  admiration !  " 

This  graceful  creature  with  its  golden  skin,  its  horns  set 
with  precious  gems,  shilling  tike  the  rising  sun  or  the  Milky 
Way,  captivated  Rama  himself,  who,  hearing  Ska's  words, 
yielded  to  her  wish  and  gaily  addressed  Lakshmana,  saying : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  mark  how  this  deer  has  excited  Vaidehi's 
desire.  On  account  of  its  supreme  beauty  this  fawn  will  lose 
89 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

its  life  to-day.  Neither  in  the  forest,  nor  in  the  region  of 
Nandana,  nor  in  the  solitude  of  Chaitaratha,  nor  anywhere  on 
earth  does  such  a  fawn  exist. 

"  See  how,  whichever  way  its  velvety  striped  skin  is  brushed, 
it  glistens.  When  it  opens  its  mouth,  its  tongue  shoots  forth 
like  a  bright  name  in  a  lit  brazier  or  lightning  from  a  cloud. 
With  its  head  of  emerald  and  crystal,  its  belly  shining  like 
mother  of  pearl,  whose  heart  would  it  not  steal  away  with  its 
indescribable  beauty  ?  Who,  on  beholding  this  divine  apparition, 
shining  like  gold,  covered  with  every  kind  of  gem,  would  not 
be  charmed? 

"  It  is  for  food  and  sport  that  kings,  bearing  their  bows, 
hunt  wild  beasts  in  the  forest,  and  many  treasures  of  different 
kinds  are  found  there  by  chance,  such  as  pearls,  diamonds  and 
gold,  increasing  man's  possessions,  surpassing  the  imagination 
of  Indra,  and,  O  Lakshmana,  this  is  the  wealth  spoken  of  by 
those  who  are  versed  in  the  Artha-Shastra. 

"  The  slender-waisted  Vaidehi  will  sit  with  me  on  the  fleece 
of  that  marvellous  deer ;  neither  the  skin  of  Kadali,  Priyaka, 
Prabeni  or  Abiki  compares  in  texture  to  that  of  this  deer. 
Truly  exquisite,  this  gazelle  and  its  counterpart1  in  the  heavens 
are  both  divine,  the  one  amongst  the  stars  and  the  other  on 
earth,  yet  if  thou  art  certain  that  this  is  an  illusion  created  by 
the  titan,  O  Lakshmana,  I  will  destroy  it.  That  cruel  and 
evil-souled  Marietta  slew  many  great  ascetics  ranging  in  the 
forest ;  innumerable  kings,  armed  with  bows,  hunting  here, 
have  fallen  under  his  assaults  when  he  assumed  the  shape  of  an 
illusive  deer ;  let  us  therefore  end  his  life. 

"Formerly  Vatapi  oppressed  the  Sages  here  also,  and, 
entering  their  stomachs,  emerged,  riving  them,  as  the  embryo 
of  a  mule  may  cause  the  death  of  its  mother.  One  day  that 
demon  encountered  the  great  Sage  Agastya,  gifted  with  divine 
powers  and  was  devoured  by  him  when  presented  in  the 
form  of  an  offering  by  his  brother  Ilwali ;  when  the  repast 
was  concluded  that  titan  called  out  *  Vatapi  come  forth '  but 
the  excellent  Rishi,  addressing  Ilwali  with  a  smile,  said : — 

" '  Since  being  blinded  by  thy  power,  many  illustrious  sages 

1  This  refers  to  the  fifth  lunar  constellation  Mrigashira,  said  to  resemble  a 
deer. 


ARANYA    KANDA 

have  fallen  victim  to  thee  on  this  earth;  thy  brother  is  now 
wholly  consumed  by  me.' 

"  O  Lakshmana,  this  titan  will  also  be  annihilated  like 
Vatapi  for  having  set  me  at  nought,  who  am  fixed  in  my  duty 
and  master  of  my  senses.  He  shall  meet  his  end,  as  did 
Vatapi  who  defied  Agastya.  Do  thou  remain  here  without 
absenting  thyself  and  guard  Sita  with  care.  It  is  our  first 
duty,  O  Delight  of  the  House  of  Raghu  !  I  shall  either  slay 
that  deer  or  bring  it  back  alive ;  till  I  return  with  the  deer, 
which  I  shall  do  without  delay,  do  thou  remain  here  with  Sita, 
O  Son  of  Sumitra.  She  shall  have  the  fawn ;  its  skin  will  cost 
it  its  life  this  day.  Now  keep  watch  over  Sita  in  the  hermitage. 
Till  with  a  single  arrow  I  have  brought  down  this  dappled 
fawn  and  slain  it,  do  thou  stay  here,  O  Lakshmana,  with  the 
mighty  raven,  Jatayu,  who  is  strong  and  wise  and  ever  engaged 
in  pious  acts,  and  protect  Maithili  in  every  way." 


CHAPTER    44 

Rama  slays  Markka 

Having  issued  this  command  to  his  brother,  that  invincible 
warrior,  the  Delight  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  endowed  with 
great  prowess,  girded  on  his  sword  in  its  golden  scabbard,  and 
taking  up  his  triply-curved  bow,  his  personal  insignia  and  two 
quivers  filled  with  arrows,  he  set  forth  with  long  strides. 
Beholding  that  Indra  among  Men,  the  king  of  the  beasts  in 
fear  disappeared  only  to  re-appear  once  more. 

Girt  with  his  sword  and  bearing  his  bow  in  his  hand,  Rama 
ran  in  the  direction  of  the  deer  and  beheld  it  in  all  its  beauty, 
close  to  him.  Bow  in  hand,  fixing  his  eyes  on  the  fawn  as  it 
fled  into  the  forest,  he  saw  it  sometimes  taking  a  single  bound, 
and  then,  in  order  to  lure  him  on,  allowing  him  to  draw  closer. 
Timid  and  fearful,  it  would  leap  into  the  air,  at  times  becoming 
visible  and  then  disappearing  in  the  depths  of  the  thickets. 

As  in  the  autumn,  stray  clouds  pass  across  the  moon's  face, 
so  that  she  sometimes  shines  in  all  her  brilliance  and  at  others 
91 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

seems  far  away,  so  appearing  and  disappearing,  Maricha,  in 
the  form  of  a  deer,  enticed  Rama  far  from  the  hermitage. 

Kakutstha  found  himself,  despite  his  exertions,  thus  beguiled 
and  the  fawn,  feigning  fatigue,  would  crouch  in  the  grass  or, 
the  better  to  deceive  him,  join  a  herd  of  deer,  but  when  Rama 
approached,  it  would  take  to  flight  once  more,  concealing 
itself,  only  to  re-appear  in  the  distance.  Sometimes,  in  fear, 
it  would  make  itself  invisible,  then,  with  Rama  in  desperate 
pursuit,  it  would  appear  in  a  far  off  thicket.  Thereupon 
increasingly  wrath,  Rama  drew  out  a  death-dealing  glittering 
arrow  more  brilliant  than  the  sun's  rays  and  placing  it  firmly 
on  his  bow,  stretching  it  with  great  energy,  let  fly  that  shaft 
that  resembled  a  fiery  serpent. 

Loosing  that  flaming  arrow,  which  resembled  a  lightning 
flash,  fashioned  by  Brahma  himself,  that  marvellous  shaft, 
pierced  the  heart  of  Maricha,  who  had  assumed  the  form  of 
a  deer.  Thereat,  bounding  into  the  air  as  high  as  a  palm  tree, 
the  titan  fell  mortally  wounded  and  lay  on  the  earth,  having 
but  a  few  moments  to  live.  On  the  point  of  death,  emitting 
a  terrible  cry,  Maricha  abandoned  his  assumed  form. 

Recollecting  the  words  of  Ravana  and  reflecting  on  how  to 
induce  Sita  to  send  away  Lakshmana,  so  that  in  her  isolation 
she  might  be  borne  away,  Maricha,  deeming  the  moment  to  be  at 
hand,  imitating  Rama's  voice,  cried  out "  O  Sita,  O  Lakshmana !  " 

Stricken  to  the  heart  by  that  extraordinary  arrow,  discarding 
his  deer's  form,  Maricha  took  on  the  huge  shape  of  a  titan. 
Then  Rama,  beholding  that  titan  of  formidable  size,  writhing 
on  the  earth  about  to  die,  his  limbs  covered  with  blood, 
remembered  the  words  of  Lakshmana  and  reflected : — "  The 
illusion  created  by  Maricha,  spoken  of  by  Lakshmana  is 
manifest,  it  is  Maricha  whom  I  have  slain.  What  will  Ska 
not  do  on  hearing  the  cry  of  the  stricken  titan :  (  O  Sita,  O 
Lakshmana '  ?  To  what  a  pass  will  the  mighty  Lakshmana 
now  have  come  ?  " 

Thus  did  the  virtuous  Rama  reflect,  his  hair  standing  on 
end  and,  having  slain  the  titan  in  the  form  of  a  deer  and  heard 
his  cry,  a  great  dread  seized  him. 

That  dappled  fawn  being  slain,  Rama  speedily  killed  and  seized 
the  carcase  of  another  deer  and  hastened  towards  the  hermitage.

CHAPTER    45 

Sita  sends  Lakskmana  to  Rama's  Assistance 

Hearing  that  cry  of  distress,  which  seems  to  come  from  her 
lord,  Sita  said  to  Lakshmana : — 

"  Dost  thou  not  recognise  the  voice  of  Raghava  ?  Go  quickly 
and  see  what  has  befallen  him.  Hearing  his  cry,  my  heart  is 
filled  with  anxiety ;  he  must  be  in  great  peril  to  call  out  thus  ; 
go  to  the  assistance  of  thy  brother,  he  is  in  need  of  thee.  He 
has  been  overpowered  by  the  titans  like  a  bull  by  lions." 

Recollecting  Rama's  command,  Lakshmana  withstood  Sita's 
appeal  and  did  not  move,  whereupon  Janaki,  highly  provoked, 
said  to  him  : — 

"  O  Son  of  Sumitra,  under  the  guise  of  affection  thou  dost 
show  emnity  towards  thy  brother,  since  thou  dost  not  instantly 
proceed  to  his  aid !  Because  of  me,  Rama  is  about  to  die ! 
In  thy  desire  to  possess  me,  thou  dost  refuse  to  follow  Raghava; 
thou  dost  welcome  his  death  and  hast  no  affection  for  him. 
It  is  for  this  reason  that  thou  dost  remain  indifferent  to  his 
plight ;  if  he  is  in  peril,  of  what  use  is  my  life  ?  It  is  on  his 
account  that  I  came  hither," 

Thus,  weeping  and  overcome  with  grief,  did  Vaidehi  speak, 
and  Lakshmana  answering  her,  who  was  trembling  luce  a 
frightened  doe,  said : — 

"  O  Vaidehi,  neither  serpents,  titans,  celestial  beings,  Gods, 
giants  nor  demons  can  overcome  thy  lord.  Assuredly,  O 
Princess,  among  Gods  and  Kinneras,  wild  beasts  and  goblins, 
there  are  none  who  can  stand  against  Rama  in  battle.  O 
Beautiful  One,  he  who  is  equal  to  Indra  is  invincible.  Do  not 
speak  thus  t  I  dare  not  leave  thee  alone  in  the  forest  without 
Rama. 

"  Even  the  Three  Worlds  and  the  Gods,  with  Indra  Himself 

at  their  head,  meeting  Rama  in  combat,  would  be  overcome 

by  him,  therefore  calm  thyself  and  banish  all  fear.    Thy  lord 

will  soon  return,  having  killed  the  marvellous  deer ;  that  voice 

93 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

is  assuredly  not  his,  nor  that  of  a  God  ;  it  is  an  illusion,  like 
the  city  of  the  Gandharvas  and  has  been  produced  by  the 
titan. 

"  O  Vaidehi,  thou  hast  been  left  in  my  charge  by  the  magnani- 
mous Rama.  O  Fair  One,  I  dare  not  leave  thee  here  alone. 
We  are  an  object  of  hatred  to  the  titans  since  the  slaying  of 
Khara  and  the  destruction  of  Janasthana.  The  titans  are  able 
to  simulate  the  voices  of  others  in  the  great  forest  and  delight 
in  doing  so  in  order  to  trouble  the  virtuous.  O  Vaidehi,  have 
no  anxiety ! " 
At  these  words,  Sita,  her  eyes  flashing  with  anger,  answered: — 
"  O  Thou  Evil-hearted  Wretch,  Obloquy  of  thy  Race,  who 
delightest  in  Rama's  misfortune !  Is  it  a  source  of  wonder 
that  a  villain  such  as  thou,  perverse,  whose  motives  are  con- 
cealed, should  speak  thus  in  the  hour  of  Rama's  distress  ?  By 
an  excess  of  perfidy,  thou  hast  accompanied  Rama  to  the  forest 
and,  practising  guile,  lusteth  after  me,  while  assuming  the  form 
of  a  friend !  Or  hast  thou  been  engaged  by  Bharata  as  his 
agent?  Thy  design  as  also  Bharata's,  shall  not  succeed,  O 
Saumitri!  How  should  I  desire  another  after  serving  the 
lotus-eyed  Rama  as  my  lord  ?  Rather  would  I  yield  up  my  life 
in  thy  presence,  O  Saumitri ;  without  Rama,  I  cannot  maintain 
life  on  this  earth  for  an  instant." 

Hearing  these  cruel  words,  causing  him  to  shudder, 
Lakshmana,  the  master  of  his  senses,  with  joined  palms 
answered  her,  saying : — 

"  It  is  not  for  me  to  gainsay  thee ;  thou  art  as  a  goddess 
to  me.  An  ill-considered  utterance  from  a  woman  causes  no 
surprise.  Negligent  in  her  duty,  fickle  and  peevish,  woman 
is  the  cause  of  dissension  between  father  and  son ;  truly  I  am 
unable  to  endure  these  words  of  thine  that  pierce  my  ears 
like  flaming  darts,  O  Daughter  of  Janaka !  0  Vaidehi,  may 
all  the  inhabitants  of  the  forest  bear  witness  that  to  my  re- 
spectful address  thou  hast  responded  with  such  bitterness ! 
It  will  go  hard  with  thee  this  day  for  having  set  me  at  nought, 
I,  who  am  obedient  to  the  behests  of  mine  elder  brother ! 
May  all  the  Deities  protect  thee,  O  Lady  of  Large  Eyes  ! 
Sinister  portents  present  themselves  to  me !  May  I  find  thee 
safe  when  I  return !  " 

94 


ARANYA    KANDA 

At  these  words,  the  daughter  of  Janaka  began  to  weep  and 
scalding  tears  bathed  her  countenance  as  she  answered : — 

"  If  I  am  separated  from  Rama,  I  shall  cast  myself  into  the 
river  Godaveri !  O  Lakshmana,  I  shall  hang  myself  or  enter 
into  the  fire,  but  I  shall  never  approach  any  man  other  than 
Raghava ! " 

Thus  protesting  before  Lakshmana,  Sita,  distraught,  beat 
her  breast  with  her  hands  and  lamented. 

In  the  face  of  her  despair,  Lakshmana,  distressed,  sought 
to  comfort  her,  but  she  refused  to  answer  the  brother  of  her 
lord,  whereupon  he,  bending  low  before  her,  set  out  to  rejoin 
Rama,  looking  back  again  and  again. 


CHAPTER    46 

Havana  approaches  Sita 

Stung  by  Sita's  bitter  words,  Lakshmana,  in  his  ardent  desire 
to  rejoin  his  elder  brother  Rama,  set  out  without  further  delay. 

Thereupon  Ravana,  in  the  guise  of  a  mendicant,  availing 
himself  of  the  opportunity,  rapidly  approached  the  hermitage 
with  the  purpose  of  seeking  out  Vaidehi.  With  matted  locks, 
clad  in  a  saffron  robe  and  carrying  a  triple  staff  and  loshta, 
that  highly  powerful  one,  knowing  Sita  to  be  alone,  accosted 
her  in  the  wood,  in  the  form  of  an  ascetic,  at  dusk  when  dark- 
ness shrouds  the  earth  in  the  absence  of  the  sun  and  moon. 
Gazing  on  Sita,  the  consort  of  Rama,  Ravana  resembled  Rahu 
regarding  Rohini  in  the  absence  of  Shasi. 

Beholding  that  monstrous  apparition,  the  leaves  of  the  trees 
ceased  to  move,  the  wind  grew  still,  the  turbulent  course  of 
the  river  Godaveri  subsided  and  began  to  flow  quietly.  The 
ten-headed  Ravana,  however,  profiting  by  Rama's  absence, 
drew  near  to  Sita  in  the  guise  of  a  monk  of  venerable  appear- 
ance while  she  was  overcome  with  grief  on  account  of  her  lord. 

Approaching  Vaidehi  in  an  honourable  guise,  as  Saturn 
draws  near  to  the  Chitra  star,  Ravana  resembled  a  deep  well 

95 


THE  RAMAYANA  OF  VALMIKI 
overgrown  with  grass.  He  stood  there  gazing  on  the  glorious 
consort  of  Rama  of  incomparable  beauty,  Sita,  with  her 
brilliant  lips  and  teeth,  her  countenance  as  radiant  as  the  full 
moon,  seated  on  a  carpet  of  leaves,  overwhelmed  with  grief, 
weeping  bitterly. 

On  seeing  the  Princess  of  Videha  alone,  clad  in  a  yellow 
silken  sari,  whose  eyes  resembled  lotus  petals,  the  titan,  struck 
by  Kama's  arrow,  joyfully  accosted  her,  feigning  the  gentle 
accents  of  a  brahmin.  Praising  her  beauty,  unequalled  in 
the  Three  Worlds,  which  caused  her  to  resemble  Shri,  he 
said: — 

"  O  Thou,  possessed  of  the  brilliance  of  gold  and  silver, 
who  art  clad  in  a  yellow  silken  sari  and  who,  like  a  pool  of 
lilies,  art  wreathed  in  garlands  of  fresh  flowers,  art  thou 
Lakshmi  bereft  of  her  lotus  or  Kirti  or  a  nymph  of  graceful 
aspect  ?  Art  thou  Bhuti  of  slender  hips,  or  Rati  disporting 
herself  in  tht  forest  ? 

"  How  even,  sharp  and  white  are  thy  teeth,  how  large  thy 
slightly  reddened  eyes  with  their  dark  pupils,  how  well  pro- 
portioned and  rounded  are  thy  thighs  and  how  charming  thy 
legs,  resembling  the  tapering  trunk  of  an  elephant!  How 
round  and  plump  are  thy  cheeks,  like  unto  the  polished  fruit 
of  the  Tala  trees ;  how  enchanting  is  thy  bosom,  decorated 
with  pearls  ! 

"  O  Lady  of  Sweet  Smiles,  lovely  teeth  and  expressive  eyes, 
as  a  river  sweeps  away  its  banks  with  its  swift  current  so  dost 
thou  steal  away  my  heart,  O  Graceful  One.  Slender  is  thy 
waist,  glossy  thine  hair,  thy  breasts  touching  each  other  enhance 
thy  loveliness ;  neither  the  consorts  of  the  Gods,  the  Gan- 
dharvas,  the  Yakshas  nor  the  Kinneras  can  compare  with  thee. 
'Till  this  hour,  I  have  never  seen  any  on  earth  so  perfect ; 
thy  youth,  thy  beauty  and  thy  grace  are  unequalled  in  the 
Three  Worlds ! 

"  Seeing  thee  dwelling  here  in  solitude  distresses  my  heart. 
Come  with  me !  It  is  not  fitting  that  thou  shouldst  remain 
here;  this  place  is  frequented  by  ruthless  demons,  who  are 
able  to  assume  different  forms  at  will.  It  is  for  thee  to  reside 
in  sumptuous  and  delightful  palaces  in  the  vicinity  of  pleasant 
cities,  surrounded  by  groves  of  sweet  smelling  shrubs  and 
96 


ARANYA    KANDA 

green  trees,  where  thou  canst  wander  clad  in  beautiful  robes, 
decked  in  fragrant  garlands,  with  a  consort  worthy  of  thy 
beauty,  O  Charming  One.  O  Dark-eyed  Lady  of  Sweet  Smiles, 
art  thou  wedded  to  one  of  the  Rudras,  the  Maruts  or  Vasus  ? 
Thou  appearest  divine  to  me,  yet  these  are  not  the  haunts  of 
the  Gandharvas,  Devas  or  Kinneras,  but  of  the  Titans.  How 
hast  thou  come  here? 

"  Dost  thou  not  fear  to  live  amidst  monkeys,  lions,  tigers, 
deer,  wolves,  bears,  hyenas  and  leopards  ?  O  Fair  One,  dost 
thou  not  tremble  before  those  terrible  elephants,  maddened 
with  the  exudation  of  temporal  juices,  in  this  great  forest  ? 
Who  art  thou  ?  To  whom  dost  thou  belong  ?  For  what  reason 
dost  thou  range  the  Dandaka  Forest  alone,  which  is  frequented 
by  terrible  titans  ?  " 

With  these  flattering  words  did  the  evil-minded  Havana 
address  Sita,  and  seeing  him  in  the  guise  of  a  brahmin,  she 
entertained  him  with  the  traditional  hospitality  due  to  an 
uninvited  guest.  Leading  him  to  a  seat,  she  brought  water 
to  wash  his  feet  and  offered  him  food,  saying : — "  Be  pleased 
to  accept  this  repast ! "  Seeing  him  in  the  form  of  a  Twice- 
born  with  his  loshta  and  saffron  robe,  unrecognizable  in  his 
disguise,  Sita  welcomed  him  as  a  true  brahmin,  saying : — 

"  Be  seated,  O  Brahmin,  and  accept  this  water  for  washing 
thy  feet,  also  this  meal,  composed  of  ripe  fruits  and  roasted 
grain,  prepared  for  thee,  which  please  enjoy." 

Thus  did  she  receive  him  with  hospitable  words,  but  Ravana, 
his  gaze  fixed  on  the  Princess  of  Mithila,  determined  to  bear 
her  away,  thus  preparing  his  own  destruction. 

Sita,  anxiously  expecting  the  return  from  hunting  of  her 
illustrious  lord,  with  Prince  Lakshmana,  searched  the  vast 
and  darkening  forest  with  her  eyes  but  was  unable  to  see  either 
Rama  or  his  brother  there.

The  Conversation  of  Ravana  and  Sita 

Thus  addressed  by  Ravana  in  the  guise  of  a  mendicant,  who 
had  resolved  to  bear  her  away,  Sita  reflected : — 

'  This  person  is  my  guest  and  a  brahmin ;  if  I  do  not  answer 
him  he  may  curse  me ! '  and  thinking  thus,  she  said: — 

"  May  good  betide  thee !  I  am  the  daughter  of  the  high- 
souled  Janaka,  the  King  of  Mithila,  my  name  is  Sita  and  I 
am  the  beloved  consort  of  Rama.  For  twelve  years,  I  dwelt 
in  the  palace  of  Ikshwaku,  where  all  my  desires  were  gratified 
and  I  enjoyed  every  comfort. 

"  In  the  thirteenth  year,  the  king  with  the  approval  of  his 
ministers  decided  to  enthrone  Rama.  All  being  ready  for  the 
installation  of  Raghava,  Kaikeyi,  one  of  my  mothers-in-law, 
requested  a  boon  of  her  lord.  Having  gratified  my  father-in- 
law  by  her  services,  she  extracted  two  promises  from  him,  the 
exile  of  my  husband  and  the  installation  of  her  son  Bharata, 
saying : — '  I  shall  neither  eat  drink  nor  sleep  if  Rama  is 
enthroned  and  it  will  prove  the  end  of  my  life.' 

"  The  Lord  of  the  Earth,  my  father-in-law,  hearing  her 
speak  thus,  offered  her  diverse  gifts,  but  Kaikeyi  refused  them. 
At  that  time,  my  lord  was  twenty-five  years  old  and  I  eighteen. 
Being  loyal,  virtuous,  honourable  and  devoted  to  the  good  of 
all,  my  lord,  Rama,  endowed  with  long  arms  and  large  eyes, 
was  renowned  throughout  the  world.  Our  rather  King 
Dasaratha,  blinded  by  passion,  in  order  to  please  Kaikeyi, 
did  not  install  Rama,  and  when  he  came  before  his  sire,  in 
order  to  receive  the  crown,  Kaikeyi  addressed  the  following 
bitter  words  to  him : — "  O  Ramachandra,  hear  from  me  the 
decree  issued  by  thy  father.  This  great  kingdom  is  to  be 
given  to  Bharata  and  thou  art  to  dwell  in  the  forest  for  fourteen 
years.  Now  go  hence,  and  save  thy  sire  from  the  sin  of 
perjury." 

"  Then  the  imperturbable  Rama  replied :    *  So  be  it  *  and 

acted  accordingly.    My  lord  of  firm  vows,  accustomed  to  give 

98 


ARANYA    KANDA 

and  not  to  receive  commands,  who  ever  speaketh  truth  without 
prevarication,  hearing  these  words  acquiesced  and  has  fulfilled 
his  vow  to  the  uttermost.  His  brother,  the  valiant  Lakshraana, 
a  Lion  among  Men  and  the  companion  of  Rama  in  combat, 
the  Destroyer  of  his  Foes,  given  to  asceticism,  bearing  his  bow, 
followed  Rama  into  exile  with  me. 

"  Thus  Raghava,  fixed  in  his  vow,  wearing  matted  locks, 
accompanied  by  myself  and  his  younger  brother,  penetrated 
into  the  depths  of  the  forest  of  Dandaka.  We  have  all  three 
been  banished  from  the  kingdom  by  Kaikeyi  and,  depending 
on  our  own  strength,  wander  about  in  the  forest.  Remain 
here  awhile,  O  Foremost  of  the  Twice-born,  my  lord  will  soon 
return  with  an  abundance  of  roots  and  fruit  and  sufficient 
venison,  having  slain  deer,  kine  and  boar.  But  thou,  O 
Brahmin,  tell  me  who  thou  an  and  what  thy  name,  family 
and  lineage.    Why  dost  thou  range  the  Dandaka  Forest  alone?  " 

Hearing  the  words  of  Sita,  the  consort  of  Rama,  the  mighty 
titan  replied  in  these  harsh  words  : — 

"  O  Sita,  I  am  that  Ravana,  King  of  the  Titans,  in  fear  of 
whom  the  world,  the  Gods,  titans  and  men  tremble.  O 
Source  of  Delight,  since  I  beheld  thee  shining  like  gold,  clad 
in  silk,  my  consorts  have  ceased  to  find  favour  with  me.  Do 
thou  become  the  chief  queen  of  those  countless  women,  stolen 
away  from  many  quarters  by  me. 

"  Lanka,  my  capital,  set  in  the  midst  of  the  sea,  is  built  on 
the  summit  of  a  hill.  There,  O  Sita,  wander  with  me  in  the 
groves  and  thus  forget  the  forest.  O  Lovely  One,  if  thou 
dost  become  my  wife,  five  thousand  servants  adorned  with 
diverse  ornaments  shall  attend  on  thee." 

The  blameless  daughter  of  Janaka,  being  thus  addressed  by 
Ravana,  was  filled  with  indignation  and  answered  that  titan 
with  contempt,  saying : — 

"  I  am  dependent  on  my  lord,  Rama,  who  is  as  steadfast 
as  a  rock,  calm  as  the  ocean  and  equal  to  Mahendra  himself, 
Rama,  endowed  with  every  good  quality,  who  resembles  the 
Nyagrodha  tree  in  stature.  I  am  dependent  on  that  illustrious 
and  noble  warrior,  whose  arms  are  long,  whose  chest  is  broad, 
whose  gait  is  like  a  lion's,  nay,  who  resembles  that  king  of 
beasts  ;  to  him,  the  greatest  of  men,  I  give  my  whole  allegiance. 
99  h 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

To  Rama,  whose  countenance  resembles  the  full  moon,  the 
son  of  a  king,  master  of  his  passions,  of  immeasurable  renown 
and  power,  I  shall  ever  remain  faithful. 

"  O  Jackal,  thou  desirest  a  she-lion  but  art  no  more  able  to 
possess  me  than  grasp  the  light  of  the  sun !  Thou  Wretch, 
who  seekest  to  carry  off  the  beloved  spouse  of  Raghava  !  Verily 
thou  dost  imagine  the  trees  that  thou  seest  before  thee  to  be 
made  of  gold,1  that  thou  art  seeking  to  draw  the  teeth  of  a 
famished  and  courageous  lion,  that  enemy  of  the  deer,  or 
extract  the  fangs  of  a  poisonous  snake.  Dost  thou  desire  to 
lift  up  the  Mandara  mountain  with  thy  bare  hands  or  live  at 
ease  after  drinking  poison  ?  Thou  dost  seek  to  rub  thine  eyes 
with  a  needle  and  lick  a  razor  with  thy  tongue  !  Thou  desirest 
to  cross  the  ocean  with  a  stone  round  thy  neck  or  grasp  the 
sun  and  moon.  O  Thou  who  seekest  to  bear  away  the  beloved 
wife  of  Rama,  thou  art  endeavouring  to  carry  a  blazing  fire 
in  thy  robe  or  walk  on  iron  spikes. 

"  The  disparity  between  thee  and  Rama  is  as  that  between 
a  jackal  and  a  lion,  a  brook  and  an  ocean,  the  nectar  of  the 
Gods  and  sour  barley  gruel;  between  gold  and  iron,  sandal  and 
mud,  an  elephant  and  a  cat,  an  eagle  and  a  crow,  a  peacock 
and  a  duck,  a  swan  and  a  vulture.  Even  shouldst  thou  steal 
me,  if  that  mighty  archer,  Rama,  whose  prowess  is  equal  to 
the  Lord  of  a  Thousand  Eyes,  still  lives,  thou  wilt  no  more 
be  able  to  devour  me  than  a  fly  can  eat  the  clarified  butter 
into  which  it  has  fallen." 

Addressing  that  cruel  Ranger  of  the  Night  thus,  the  guileless 
Sita  shook  like  a  leaf  in  the  wind. 

Perceiving  her  distress,  Ravana,  terrible  as  death,  began  to 
boast  of  his  race,  his  power,  his  name  and  his  exploits,  in  order 
to  increase  her  fear.

Stta  defies  Ravana 

Provoked  by  Sita's  proud  words,  Ravana,  scowling,  answered 
her  in  fierce  accents  : — 

"  O  Lady  of  Fair  Complexion,  may  prosperity  attend  thee ! 
I  am  the  brother  of  the  Lord  of  Wealth,  my  name  is  Ravana. 
I  am  the  mighty  Dashagriva  from  whom,  as  all  creatures 
before  death,  the  Gods,  Gandharvas,  Pisachas,  Patagas  and 
Nagas  flee  in  terror.  I  have  subdued  my  blood-brother 
Kuvera,  who  for  a  certain  reason  I  incited  to  combat  and  who, 
vanquished  by  me,  fled  in  alarm  from  his  sumptuous  abode 
and  sought  refuge  on  Kailasha,  the  Lord  of  Mountains. 

"  By  virtue  of  my  prowess  I  robbed  him  of  his  marvellous 
chariot,  Pushpaka,  that  moves  according  to  one's  will,  and  in 
it  I  range  the  skies.  Seeing  my  dread  visage,  the  Gods  with 
Indra  at  their  head  flee  in  terror,  O  Maithili.  Wheresoever 
I  roam,  the  wind  blows  temperately  and  the  rays  of  the  sun 
resemble  the  moon's.  Where  I  stay,  the  leaves  of  the  trees 
become  motionless  and  the  rivers  cease  to  flow. 

"  Beyond  the  sea  stands  my  magnificent  capital,  Lanka, 
inhabited  by  powerful  titans,  equal  to  Indra's  citadel,  Amaravati. 

"  That  beautiful  stronghold,  encircled  by  dazzling  battle- 
ments with  golden  ramparts  and  gates  of  emerald,  is  a  city  of 
dreams. 

"  Filled  with  elephants,  horses  and  chariots,  echoing  to  the 
sound  of  bugles,  it  is  embellished  by  pleasant  gardens  planted 
with  diverse  trees,  yielding  fruit  of  every  desirable  taste. 
O  Sita,  OThou  Daughter  of  a  King,  in  that  city  thou  shalt  dwell 
with  me,  forgetting  the  lot  of  mortal  women.  There  thou 
shalt  taste  celestial  delights !  O  Lady  of  exquisite  countenance, 
think  of  Rama  no  more,  who  is  but  human  and  whose  end  is 
near.  Placing  his  beloved  son  on  the  throne,  King  Dasaratha 
sent  his  heir  of  negligible  prowess  to  the  forest.  What 
wouldst  thou  with  that  Rama,  deprived  of  his  kingdom,  living 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

as  an  ascetic  in  solitude,  O  Large-eyed  Beauty  ?  I,  the  Lord 
of  all  the  titans,  have  come  to  thee  in  person,  pierced  by  the 
shafts  of  the  God  of  Love.  It  does  not  befit  thee  to  disregard 
me.  O  Timid  Lady,  if  thou  dost  pass  me  by,  thou  wilt  repent, 
like  Urvashi,  who  thrust  away  Puraravas  with  her  foot.  Rama 
is  but  a  mortal  and  not  equal  to  even  a  finger  of  mine  in  combat. 
By  good  fortune  I  have  come  to  thee ;  do  thou  therefore  yield 
thyself  to  me,  O  Fair  One." 

At  these  words,  Vaidehi,  her  eyes  flashing  with  anger, 
though  alone,  answered  that  Lord  of  the  Titans  boldly,  saying: — 

"  Since  thou  claimest  to  be  the  brother  of  the  God,  Kuvera, 
who  is  held  in  veneration  by  all  the  Celestials,  how  dost  thou 
dare  to  commit  this  infamous  deed,  O  Ravana  ?  Undoubtedly 
all  the  titans  will  meet  with  destruction,  having  so  cruel, 
senseless  and  lustful  a  person  as  thee  as  their  sovereign.  The 
ravisher  of  Indra's  consort,  Sachi,  may  survive,  but  he  who 
bears  away  the  wife  of  Rama  will  never  live  in  peace.  O 
Titan,  it  were  possible  for  the  one  who  deprives  the  Bearer 
of  the  Thunderbolt  of  his  consort  of  unsurpassed  beauty  to 
live  on  earth,  but  he  who  insults  me  will  never  escape  death, 
were  he  to  drink  the  water  of  immortality !  " 


chapter   49 

Sita's  Abduction  by  Ravana 

Hearing  those  words  of  Sita,  the  mighty  Ravana,  striking  one 
hand  on  the  other,  revealed  his  gigantic  form  and,  skilled  in 
speech,  addressed  her,  saying  : — 

"  Methinks  thou  hast  taken  leave  of  thy  senses,  hast  thou 
not  heard  of  my  great  prowess  and  valour  ?  Standing  in  space, 
I  am  able  to  lift  up  the  earth ;  I  can  drink  the  waters  of  the 
ocean  and  destroy  death  himself  in  combat.  With  my  shafts 
I  can  pierce  the  sun  and  cleave  the  terrestial  globe.  Thou, 
who  dost  allow  thyself  to  be  deceived  by  any  trick  and  dost 
follow  any  whim,  behold  how  I  can  change  my  shape  at  will." 

Speaking  thus,  Ravana,  full  of  wrath,  his  eyes  glowing  like 


ARANYA    KANDA 

burning  coals,  resembled  a  flame,  and  discarding  his  benign 
aspect,  he,  the  younger  brother  of  Kuvera,  assumed  a  terrible 
shape,  resembling  death  itself. 

With  smouldering  eyes,  a  prey  to  anger,  resplendent  in 
ornaments  of  fine  gold,  like  a  dark  cloud,  that  Ranger  of  the 
Night  appeared  before  her  with  his  ten  heads  and  twenty  arms. 
Abandoning  his  ascetic  disguise,  the  King  of  the  Titans  took 
on  his  native  form ;  wearing  a  blood-red  robe,  he  fixed  that 
pearl  among  women,  Maithili,  with  his  gaze,  thereafter  address- 
ing her,  who  resembled  the  sun,  whose  hair  was  dark  and 
who  was  clothed  in  a  robe  and  jewels,  saying : — 

"  O  Fair  Lady,  if  thou  desirest  a  master  famed  throughout 
the  Three  Worlds,  then  surrender  thyself  to  me.  I  am  a 
husband  worthy  of  thee ;  do  thou  serve  me  forever !  I  shall 
do  thee  great  honour  nor  will  I  ever  displease  thee.  Re- 
nouncing thine  attachment  to  a  man,  place  thine  affection  on 
me.  What  binds  thee  to  Rama,  O  Thou  Foolish  One  who 
deemest  thyself  wise ;  he  who  has  been  banished  from  his 
domain,  who  has  failed  to  fulfil  his  destiny  and  whose  days 
are  numbered,  Rama,  who  on  the  injunction  of  a  woman  aban- 
doned kingdom,  friends  and  people  to  inhabit  a  forest 
frequented  by  wild  beasts  ?  " 

Speaking  thus  to  Maithili,  who  was  worthy  of  tenderness 
and  gentle  of  speech,  that  wicked  titan,  inflamed  by  passion, 
seized  hold  of  her  as  Budha  seizes  Rohini.  With  his  left 
hand  he  grasped  the  hair  of  the  lotus-eyed  Sita,  and  with  his 
right,  her  thighs.  Seeing  Ravana  with  his  sharp  teeth  like 
the  peak  of  a  mountain,  resembling  death  itself,  the  Celestial 
Beings  fled  away  in  terror.  Then  instantly  the  great  chariot 
belonging  to  Ravana,  made  of  gold,  to  which  braying  mules 
were  harnessed,  appeared  and,  addressing  Sita  in  harsh  tones, 
he  lifted  her  up  and,  clasping  her,  ascended  the  car. 

Then  the  virtuous  and  unfortunate  Sita,  being  overpowered 
by  the  titan,  began  to  cry  aloud,  "  Rama !  Rama !  n  but  he 
was  far  away  in  the  depths  of  the  forest.  Though  she  possessed 
no  love  for  him,  Ravana,  burning  with  passion,  rose  high  into 
the  air  with  her,  as  she  struggled  like  the  consort  of  the  Indra 
of  Serpents. 

Seeing  herself  borne  through  the  air  by  the  King  of  the 
103 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Titans,  Sita  with  piercing  shrieks,  distracted  with  anguish, 
cried  out :  "  O  Lakshmana,  thou  long-armed  warrior,  ever 
ministering  to  the  satisfaction  of  thy  superiors,  dost  thou  not 
know  that  I  am  being  carried  away  by  a  titan  able  to  assume 
any  shape  at  will  ?  O  Raghava  thou,  who  art  willing  to  renounce 
life  and  happiness  in  the  cause  of  duty,  dost  thou  not  see  that 
I  have  been  borne  away  by  one  of  unsurpassed  wickedness  ? 
O  Thou,  the  Scourge  of  Thine  Enemies,  art  thou  not  accustomed 
to  punish  evildoers  ?  Why  dost  thou  not  subdue  the  arrogance 
of  this  wicked  titan  ?  It  is  true  that  an  evil  deed  does  not  bear 
fruit  immediately,  but  time  causes  the  grain  to  ripen. 

"  For  this  outrage,  bereft  of  thy  senses  by  fate,  thou  shalt, 
O  Ravana,  meet  with  a  terrible  retribution,  bringing  about 
thine  end.  Alas !  The  designs  of  Kaikeyi  are  crowned  with 
success,  since  I,  the  virtuous  consort  of  Rama  am  separated 
from  that  hero.  I  invoke  Janasthana  and  the  flowering  Kami- 
kara  trees,  so  that  they  may  tell  Rama  speedily  that  Sita  has 
been  borne  away  by  Ravana !  I  appeal  to  the  Godaveri  river, 
that  re-echoes  to  the  cry  of  cranes  and  swans,  to  inform  Rama 
that  Ravana  has  stolen  Sita  away !  Offering  salutations  to  the 
forest  Deities,  I  call  upon  them  to  tell  my  lord  of  mine  abduc- 
tion !  I  beseech  all  creatures,  whatever  they  may  be,  whether 
beast  or  bird  or  those  that  inhabit  the  forest,  to  make  these 
tidings  known  to  Rama  and  to  tell  him  that  his  tender  spouse, 
dearer  to  him  than  life,  has  been  forcibly  borne  away  by 
Ravana.  Were  death  himself  my  ravisher,  that  mighty-armed 
one,  hearing  this  report,  would  rescue  me  by  his  prowess ! " 

In  the  extremity  of  her  grief,  the  large-eyed  Sita,  uttering 
this  lament,  observed  the  vulture  Jatayu,  perching  on  a  tree. 
Thereupon  beholding  him,  the  beautiful  Sita,  borne  away  by 
Ravana,  who  was  filled  with  carnal  desire,  cried  out  in  piteous 
tones : — 

"  O  Noble  jatayu,  see  how  I  am  being  ruthlessly  carried  off 
by  the  wicked  King  of  the  Titans,  like  a  woman  bereft  of  her 
protector.  Thou  wilt  not  be  able  to  resist  him,  for  this  cruel 
and  evil  Ranger  of  the  Night  is  powerful,  arrogant  and  furnished 
with  weapons.  Nevertheless,  O  Bird,  do  thou  bear  the  tidings 
of  mine  abduction  to  Rama  and  Lakshmana  and  tell  them  all, 
omitting  nothing."

Jatayu  attacks  Ravana 

Jatayu,  who  was  fast  asleep,  awoke  on  hearing  these  words 
and  beheld  Ravana  and  the  daughter  of  Videha. 

Thereupon,  the  King  of  Birds,  with  his  sharp  beak  resembling 
the  peak  of  a  mountain,  perching  on  the  tree,  spoke  softly  to 
Ravana,  saying : — 

"  O  Dashagriva,  I  am  conversant  with  the  Puranas,  firm  in 
my  vows,  and  follow  the  path  of  dharma.  O  Brother,  it  does 
not  become  thee  to  commit  this  infamy  in  my  presence !  My 
name  is  Jatayu,  the  King  of  the  Vultures  ;  she  whom  thou  dost 
seek  to  bear  away  is  the  beautiful  Sita,  the  faithful  and  illustrious 
consort  of  the  Protector  of  the  Worlds,  that  Lord  of  Men, 
Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  who  is  equal  to  Varuna  and 
Mahendra  and  ever  engaged  in  the  welfare  of  all  beings. 

"  How  can  a  king,  fixed  in  his  duty,  look  upon  another's 
wife  ?  O  Thou  of  mighty  prowess,  it  is  for  thee  particularly 
to  defend  the  consorts  of  kings,  therefore  control  thy  base 
inclination  to  insult  the  wife  of  another.  A  noble  person  will 
ever  eschew  that  which  may  bring  reproach  on  him,  and 
protects  another's  wife  as  if  she  were  his  own. 

"  O  Delight  of  Poulastya,  whether  it  concerns  that  which  is 
expedient  or  agreeable,  in  the  absence  of  the  authority  of  the 
scriptures,  men  of  honour  follow  the  example  of  a  king  in 
matters  of  duty.  A  king  represents  duty,  a  king  represents 
desire  and  is  the  supreme  treasury  of  his  subjects  ;  he  is  the 
root  of  good  and  evil. 

"  O  King  of  the  Titans,  thou  art  wicked  and  fickle  by  nature; 
how  hast  thou  obtained  a  kingdom,  like  unto  a  sinner  winning 
the  celestial  abode  ?  It  is  hard  for  an  unruly  and  passionate 
man  to  change  his  nature ;  noble  counsels  are  not  long  remem- 
bered by  perverse  persons.  Since  the  mighty  and  virtuous 
Rama  has  never  done  a  wrong  in  thy  kingdom  or  capital, 
why  dost  thou  seek  to  provoke  him  ?  Is  Rama  of  irreproach- 
105 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

able  action  to  blame  if  he  slew  the  wicked  Khara  in  Janasthana 
on  account  of  Shurpanakha  ?  Why  dost  thou  seek  to  bear  away 
the  consort  of  that  Lotd  of  Men  ?  Release  Vaidehi  this  instant, 
lest,  with  his  dread  glance  resembling  a  glowing  brazier,  he 
consume  thee,  as  Indra  reduced  Vritra  to  ashes  with  his 
thunderbolt. 

"  O  Ravana,  thou  art  unwittingly  carrying  a  highly  venomous 
serpent  in  thy  robe ;  without  discerning  it,  thou  art  wearing 
the  noose  of  death  round  thy  neck.  A  man  should  only  bear 
that  weight  which  will  not  crush  him  and  eat  only  that  which 
does  not  give  rise  to  sickness.  Who  will  engage  himself  in 
an  act  which  is  neither  praiseworthy,  just,  nor  honourable, 
and  which  will  cost  him  his  life  ? 

"  O  Ravana,  I  am  sixty  thousand  years  old  and  have  ruled 
over  the  domain  of  mine  ancestors  with  justice.  I  am  exceed- 
ingly aged,  thou  art  youthful  and  furnished  with  a  bow,  armour 
and  arrows,  mounted  on  a  car,  yet  thou  shalt  not  escape 
without  injury,  if  thou  seekest  to  bear  Vaidehi  away.  Thou 
shalt  no  more  be  able  to  carry  her  away  by  force  in  my  presence, 
than  it  is  possible  to  destroy  the  wisdom  of  the  Veda  by  logic. 

"  If  thou  art  not  afraid,  O  Ravana,  then  halt  an  instant  and 
fight !  Thou  shalt  fall  on  the  earth  as  Khara  before  thee ! 
Rama,  clad  in  robes  of  bark,  who  more  than  once  vanquished 
the  Daityas  and  Danavas  in  the  field,  would  soon  have  slain 
thee  in  combat.  As  for  me,  what  can  I  do  ?  The  two  princes 
are  far  away  and  undoubtedly  thou  art  fleeing  in  all  haste  in 
fear  of  them,  Thou  Wretch !  Yet  while  I  still  live,  thou  shalt 
not  bear  away  the  lovely  Sita,  the  beloved  consort  of  Rama, 
whose  eyes  resemble  the  petals  of  the  lotus.  Even  at  the 
risk  of  my  life  I  shall  render  this  service  to  the  magnanimous 
Rama,  as  if  to  King  Dasaratha  himself.  Stay !  Stay  1  O 
Dashagriva,  reflect  but  for  a  moment.  O  Ravana,  I  shall 
hurl  thee  from  thy  great  chariot  like  a  ripe  fruit  from  its  stalk ! 
O  Prowler  of  the  Night,  I  challenge  thee  to  fight  to  the  last."

CHAPTER    5  I 

The  Combat  between  Jatayu  and  Ravana 

While  Jatayu,  the  King  of  Birds,  was  speaking  thus,  Ravana,  that 
Indra  among  Men,  wearing  golden  earrings,  his  eyes  red  with 
anger,  fell  upon  him  and  a  terrible  struggle  ensued  in  the  sky, 
resembling  clouds  impelled  by  the  force  of  the  wind;  in 
that  conflict  Jatayu,  King  of  Vultures,  and  Ravana,  the  Lord 
of  the  Titans,  resembled  two  vast  winged  mountains. 

Then  Ravana  began  to  shower  innumerable  steel-pointed 
shafts  on  the  mighty  King  of  the  Vultures,  but  he,  the  chief 
of  those  whose  wings  are  their  chariot,  received  them  unmoved 
and  with  his  feet  and  sharp  talons  that  foremost  of  birds  inflicted 
countless  wounds  on  the  titan.  Thereupon  Dashagriva,  filled 
with  fury,  anxious  to  destroy  his  adversary,  taking  out  formidable 
shafts,  equal  to  the  God  of  Death,  drew  his  bow  up  to  his  ear 
and  pierced  the  vulture  with  those  arrows,  which,  flying  straight 
at  their  target,  penetrated  it  with  their  steely  points. 

Seeing  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  her  eyes  bathed  in  tears,  in 
the  titan's  car,  Jatayu,  disregarding  those  shafts,  hurled  himself 
at  his  opponent  and,  with  his  claws  that  valiant  prince  of  the 
feathered  tribe  broke  that  bow  decorated  with  pearls  and 
gems  and  the  arrows  also. 

Thereupon  Ravana,  transported  with  anger,  seized  another  bow 
and  covered  him  with  a  hail  of  hundreds  and  thousands  of  arrows. 
Buried  beneath  those  shafts,  Jatayu  resembled  a  bird  in  its 
nest,  but  flapping  his  wings,  he  broke  through  that  cloud  of 
arrows  and  with  his  sharp  claws  snapped  that  mighty  bow ; 
with  a  stroke  of  his  wings  he  shattered  Ravana's  blazing  shield, 
that  resembled  Are,  and  brushed  aside  the  flaming  darts  that 
encompassed  him. 

Then  Jatayu,  in  that  conflict,  slew  the  swift-coursing  mules 
with  demons'  heads,  harnessed  with  gold,  and  demolished 
the  chariot  of  Ravana,  furnished  with  a  triple  standard  of 
bamboo  staves,  which  was  driven  by  thought  alone,  bright  as 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

fire,  its  steps  studded  with  precious  gems.  With  a  single 
movement  of  his  wings,  Jatayu  struck  down  the  canopy,  like 
unto  a  full  moon,  with  the  chowries  and  the  titans  who  wielded 
them. 

His  bow  shattered,  bereft  of  his  chariot,  horses  and  charioteer, 
Ravana  sprang  to  the  ground,  clasping  Sita  to  his  breast. 
Seeing  Ravana  descend,  his  car  destroyed,  all  beings  voiced 
their  delight  and  praised  the  King  of  the  Vultures  again  and 
again,  paying  obeisance  to  him. 

Ravana,  however,  perceiving  that  winged  hero  to  be  failing 
through  exhaustion  and  age,  greatly  encouraged,  rose  high 
into  the  air,  clasping  the  daughter  of  Janaka  to  him.  Though 
without  a  bow,  his  other  weapons  being  broken  in  combat, 
possessing  his  sword  alone,  he  clasped  Janaki  passionately  to 
his  breast.  Then  the  King  of  the  Vultures  darted  towards 
him,  barring  his  passage,  and  said  to  him : — 

'*  O  Insensate  One,  thou  art  carrying  away  the  beloved 
consort  of  Rama,  radiant  as  lightning ;  it  is  to  thy  perdition 
that  thou  hast  brought  about  her  abduction.  Like  thirsty 
men  drinking  water,  thou  art  swallowing  poison,  with  thy 
friends,  kinsfolk,  ministers,  army  and  people.  Those  who 
through  want  of  discrimination  fail  to  foresee  the  consequences 
of  their  acts  soon  perish,  as  thou  too  shalt  meet  thine  end. 
Caught  in  the  noose  of  death,  whither  wilt  thou  flee  ?  Thou 
art  like  unto  the  fish  that  swallows  the  hook  as  well  as  the  bait. 
Assuredly  those  two  invincible  heroes,  Offspring  of  the  House 
of  Raghu,  will  not  brook  the  violation  of  their  domicile.  The 
deed  that  thou  hast  basely  committed  will  be  denounced  by 
the  world,  as  the  path  frequented  by  brigands  is  eschewed 
by  honest  people.  If  thou  art  not  a  coward,  fight,  O  Ravana, 
or  pause  an  instant  and  thou  shalt  lie  dead  on  the  earth,  as 
did  thy  brother  Khara.  Truly  thou  art  engaged  in  that  which 
will  prove  thy  destruction,  as  one  on  the  brink  of  death  com- 
mits an  impious  deed.  Those  actions  leading  to  evil  are  not 
undertaken  even  by  the  Lord  of  Creation,  Swyambhu  Himself." 

Uttering  these  harsh  words,  the  valiant  Jatayu  swooped  on 

the  ten-headed  demon  and,  seizing  him  in  Ins  claws,  tore  his 

flesh  like  the  rider  of  a  restive  elephant.    Inflicting  deep 

wounds,  he  plunged  his  beak  into  his  back  and  tore  bis  hair 

108 


ARANYA    KANDA 

with  his  talons.  Thus  assailed  by  the  Vulture  King,  the 
titan,  trembling  with  rage,  pressing  Vaidehi  to  his  left  side, 
foaming  with  anger,  struck  Jatayu  with  the  palm  of  his  hand, 
whereupon  the  mighty  vulture  Jatayu,  the  Destroyer  of  his 
Foes,  hurled  himself  on  Dashagriva  and  with  his  beak  tore  off 
his  ten  left  arms.  His  arms  being  severed,  in  an  instant  as 
many  others  sprang  up  again,  like  serpents  issuing  from  an  ant 
heap,  spitting  forth  poison. 

Then,  in  his  anger,  the  mighty  Dashagriva  released  Sita  in 
order  to  beat  off  the  King  of  the  Vultures  with  his  fists  and  feet, 
and  a  mighty  struggle  arose  between  those  two  intrepid  com- 
batants, the  Chief  of  the  Titans  and  the  Foremost  of  Birds,  until 
Ravana,  drawing  his  sword,  cut  off  the  wings  and  feet  of  Jatayu, 
piercing  the  side  of  that  champion  of  Rama.  The  Ranger 
of  the  Skies  having  sundered  the  two  wings  of  that  King  of 
Vultures,  Jatayu  fell  to  the  earth,  at  the  point  of  death,  and 
seeing  him  on  the  ground,  bathed  in  blood,  Vaidehi,  exceed- 
ingly distressed,  darted  towards  him,  as  to  one  of  her  own  kin. 

Then  the  Lord  of  Lanka  beheld  that  noble  bird  of  exceed- 
ing prowess,  with  his  yellow  breast  and  plumage  resembling 
a  dark  cloud,  lying  on  the  earth,  like  an  extinguished  torch, 
whereupon  the  weeping  Sita,  daughter  of  Janaka,  whose 
countenance  was  like  unto  the  full  moon,  pressed  that  winged 
creature,  victim  of  the  wanton  Ravana,  to  her  breast. 


chapter    52 

Jatayu  being  slain,  Ravana  resumes  his  Flight 

Beholding  that  King  of  the  Vultures  struck  down  by  Ravana, 
she  whose  face  was  as  fair  as  the  moon,  stricken  with  grief, 
burst  into  lamentation,  crying  :— 

"  Visions,  omens,  dreams  and  the  cries  of  birds  are  the 

inevitable  signs  of  good  and  evil  fortune  among  men.     O 

Kakutstha,  because  of  me  wild  beasts  and  birds  are  fleeing 

away;  dost  thou  not  understand  that  a  great  calamity  has  befallen 

109 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

me  ?  0  Rama,  this  bird,  out  of  pity  for  me,  sought  to  deliver 
me  and  now  lies  dying  on  the  earth  owing  to  mine  evil  fate ! 
O  Kakutstha,  O  Lakshmana,  hasten  to  mine  aid  !  " 

Thus  did  that  lovely  woman  cry  in  her  terror,  as  if  they 
could  hear  her,  and  the  Chief  of  the  Titans,  Ravana,  continued 
to  pursue  her,  who,  far  from  her  protectors,  bearing  a  faded 
garland,  was  calling  for  aid.  Clinging  to  the  trees  like  a 
twining  creeper,  crying :  "  Save  me !  Save  me  !  ",  she  ran 
hither  and  thither  pursued  by  the  King  of  the  Titans.  Bereft 
of  Raghava,  who  was  tar  away  in  the  forest,  she  was  calling 
"  Rama,  Rama ! "  when  Ravana,  resembling  death  itself, 
to  his  destruction  seized  her  by  the  hair. 

At  this  outrage,  the  whole  universe  of  animate  and  inanimate 
beings  trembled  and  a  profound  darkness  covered  all.  The 
wind  grew  still,  the  sun  dim,  and  the  Grandsire  of  the  World, 
Swyambhu  Himself,  through  his  divine  power  seeing  Sita 
overcome,  exclaimed :  "  Our  purpose  is  accomplished  !  " 
Perceiving  violent  hands  laid  on  Sita,  the  illustrious  Sages 
inhabiting  the  Dandaka  Forest,  recognising  that  the  destruction 
of  Ravana  was  now  assured,  were  filled  with  joy  ! 

The  Lord  of  the  Titans,  however,  laying  hold  of  Sita  who 
was  weeping  and  crying  out :  "Rama!  Rama!  O  Lakshmana!" 
ascended  with  her  into  the  air. 

Of  the  hue  of  molten  gold,  attired  in  a  yellow  sari,  that 
daughter  of  a  king  resembled  lightning  athwart  the  clouds ; 
her  silken  robe,  streaming  in  the  wind,  lent  Ravana  the  sem- 
blance of  a  blazing  volcano,  and  the  coppery  and  fragrant 
lotus  leaves,  falling  from  Vaidehi  of  incomparable  beauty, 
covered  him.  Her  yellow  silken  robe  floating  in  the  air 
resembled  a  cloud  illumined  by  the  setting  sun,  but  her  pure 
countenance,  as  she  was  being  transported  through  space 
far  from  Rama,  had  lost  its  radiance,  like  a  lotus  detached  from 
its  stalk. 

Resembling  the  moon  that  rises  from  the  heart  of  a  dark 
cloud,  Sita,  her  fair  brows  crowned  with  lovely  locks,  appeared 
like  a  lotus  in  flower  that  had  lost  its  brilliance. 

With  her  sharp  and  brilliant   teeth,   glorious   eyes,   well- 
formed  nose,  sweet  mouth  and  ruby  lips,  she  resembled  the 
moon,  lovely  to  look  upon,  and  transported  through  the  air 
no 


ARANYA    KANDA 

in  Ravana's  lap,  her  face,  bathed  in  tears,  shone  as  faintly  as 
does  that  orb  during  the  daylight  hours. 

The  golden-hued  Sita  seen  against  the  dark-bodied  titan 
looked  like  the  girth  of  gold  encircling  an  elephant.  Like 
unto  the  yellow  lotus,  the  daughter  of  Janaka  with  her  shining 
ornaments  irradiated  Ravana  as  lightning  illumines  a  thunder- 
cloud, and  accompanied  by  the  clashing  of  her  jewels  the 
King  of  the  Demons  appeared  like  unto  a  muttering  cloud. 

As  Sita  was  being  borne  away,  the  petals  from  her  hair 
fell  in  a  shower  on  the  earth,  and  this  rain  of  blossom,  caused 
by  Ravana's  rapid  flight,  covered  him  also,  as  a  wreath  of  stars 
encircles  Mount  Meru,  and  suddenly  her  anklet,  encrusted 
with  pearls,  struck  the  earth  like  a  flash  of  lightning. 

Like  rosy  twigs  she  covered  the  dark  limbs  of  the  King  of 
the  Titans  with  a  radiance  equal  to  the  golden  girth  of  an 
elephant  and,  as  a  mighty  meteor  illumines  the  heavens  with 
its  splendour,  so  was  she  borne  through  the  air  by  the  younger 
brother  of  Vaishravana. 

Her  jewels,  flashing  like  fire,  fell  tinkling  on  the  earth, 
where  they  broke  into  pieces,  like  meteors  falling  from  the 
Armament,  and  her  chain  of  pearls,  bright  as  the  moon,  fell 
from  her  breast,  emitting  a  blaze  of  light,  like  the  Ganges 
falling  from  heaven. 

The  trees,  sheltering  a  myriad  birds,  bufTetted  by  the 
following  wind  that  swayed  the  topmost  branches,  seemed  to 
whisper  "  Fear  not !  "  and  the  lakes,  carpeted  with  faded 
lotuses,  filled  with  fish  and  stricken  aquatic  creatures,  appeared 
to  be  weeping  for  Maithili  as  for  a  friend.  Rushing  in  wrath 
from  all  sides,  lions,  tigers  and  other  beasts  and  birds  followed 
Sita's  shadow,  and  the  mountains  too,  with  their  cataracts  like 
faces  bathed  in  tears,  their  crests  like  arms  upraised,  seemed 
to  lament  for  Sita,  as  she  was  being  borne  away.  Beholding 
Vaidehi  carried  through  the  air,  the  glorious  sun,  oppressed 
with  sadness,  lost  its  brilliance  and  became  but  a  pale  disc. 

"  There  is  neither  justice,  equity,  nor  truth,  nor  sincerity, 
nor  kindness,  since  the  consort  of  Rama,  the  Princess  of  Videha, 
is  being  carried  away  by  Ravana."  Thus  did  the  assembled 
beings  lament,  whilst  the  young  of  the  wild  creatures,  forlorn 
and  terrified,  emitted  plaintive  cries.  Lifting  up  their  eyes, 
in 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

glassy  with  fear,  again  and  again,  the  forest  Deities,  trembling 
in  every  limb,  witnessed  the  anguish  of  Vaidebi,  who  was 
being  borne  away  so  cruelly  and  who  was  constantly  looking 
towards  the  earth  and  crying  in  faint  accents :  "  O  Lakshmana, 
ORama". 

The  guileless  Vaidehi,  her  hair  streaming  behind  her,  her 
tilaka  effaced,  was  borne  away  by  Dashagriva  to  his  own 
destruction,  and  Maithili  with  her  beautiful  teeth  and  gracious 
smile,  bereft  of  her  friends,  not  beholding  Rama  or  Lakshmana, 
grew  pale  and  felt  herself  wholly  crushed  under  the  weight 
of  her  despair. 


chapter   53 

Sit  a  censures  Ravana 

Finding  herself  borne  through  space,  Maithili,  the  daughter  of 
Janaka,  greatly  alarmed  and  filled  with  distress,  in  an  access 
of  fear,  her  eyes  red  with  tears  and  indignation,  her  voice 
broken  by  sobs,  addressed  that  ferocious  King  of  the  Titans 
who  was  bearing  her  away,  in  plaintive  tones,  saying :-— , 

"  O  Base  Wretch,  art  thou  not  ashamed  of  this  act  ?  Knowing 
me  to  be  alone,  thou  hast  laid  hands  on  me  and  carried  me 
away.  O  Sinful  Being,  thou  it  was  who,  seeking  to  abduct  me, 
didst  in  the  form  of  a  deer  lure  my  lord  away  by  the  power  of 
illusion. 

"  The  King  of  the  Vultures,  that  friend  of  my  father-in-law, 
who  sought  to  defend  me,  lies  slain !  Verily  thou  hast  shown 
great  courage,  O  Last  of  the  Titans !  To  thine  eternal  shame, 
thou  didst  not  win  me  in  fair  fight  but  without  disclosing  thy 
name  I1  Dost  thou  not  blush  to  commit  such  an  outrage? 
Wretch  that  thou  art,  to  bear  away  a  woman  who  is  defenceless 
and  the  wife  of  another !  Thy  dishonourable  exploit  will  be 
proclaimed  throughout  the  worlds.  Cursed  be  thou,  O 
Infamous  Barbarian,  who  boastcth  of  thine  heroism  1  Cursed 
be  such  valour  and  prowess,  O  Thou,  the  Obloquy  of  thy  Race, 

1  It  was  traditional  to  make  one's  name  known  before  entering  into  combat. 
112 


ARANYA    KANDA 

cursed  be  thou  in  the  world,  for  thy  conduct !  How  should 
any  restrain  thee  who  flcest  so  precipitately?  Halt  but  for 
an  instant  and  thy  life  is  forfeit !  Shouldst  thou  come  within 
the  range  of  those  two  Kings  of  Men,  thou  wouldst  not  survive 
for  a  single  moment  even  wert  thou  supported  by  an  army ! 
As  a  bird  is  not  able  to  bear  the  blazing  forest  fire,  neither 
couldst  thou  withstand  the  least  of  their  shafts ;  therefore, 
for  thine  own  good,  release  me  instantly,  O  Ravana ! 

"  Provoked  by  mine  abduction,  my  lord  with  the  aid  of  his 
brother  will  strive  to  destroy  thee  if  thou  dost  not  let  me  go. 
Thine  evil  intention,  on  account  of  which  thou  dost  seek  to 
bear  me  away,  that  vile  purpose,  will  never  find  fulfilment; 
for  even  were  I  never  again  to  see  my  lord,  who  is  endowed 
with  supreme  wisdom  and  should  fall  a  victim  to  an  enemy, 
I  should  not  survive  long. 

"  Thou  dost  disregard  thine  own  good  and  resemblest  one 
who,  in  his  last  hour,  chooses  what  is  fatal  to  him ;  none  who 
desires  his  end  courts  that  which  will  save  him.  I  see  the 
noose  of  death  about  thy  neck,  since  thou  dost  not  tremble  in 
this  exigency,  O  Titan.  Without  doubt,  thou  shah  see  those 
golden  trees,  with  leaves  like  sharp  swords  and  the  dreadful 
river  Vaitarani  flowing  with  blood  and  the  terrible  forest  and 
Shamali  tree,  with  its  flowers  of  refined  gold  and  its  leaves  of 
emerald,  bristling  with  iron  thorns.1 

"  Having  offered  this  affront  to  the  high-souled  Rama,  thou 
shalt  not  survive  the  poison  that  thou  hast  swallowed,  O  Merciless 
One.  Thou  art  caught  fast  in  the  noose  of  death ;  whither 
wilt  thou  turn  for  refuge  from  my  magnanimous  lord?  He 
who,  in  the  twinkling  of  an  eye,  without  his  brother,  destroyed 
fourteen  thousand  demons  in  combat,  how  should  that  hero, 
issue  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  skilled  in  the  use  of  every  weapon, 
full  of  valour,  not  pierce  thee  with  his  pointed  shafts,  thou 
who  hast  carried  away  his  beloved  spouse?" 

With  these  defiant  words  and  others  uttered  in  plaintive  tones, 
Vaidehi,  borne  away  in  Ravana's  arms,  addressed  him,  though 
filled  with  grief  and  fear.  Yet,  despite  her  distress  and  lamenta- 
tions, Ravana  continued  on  his  way,  bearing  that  sweet  and  gentle 
princess,  still  struggling  to  break  free.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER    54 

Ravana  reaches  Lanka  with  Sita 

Borne  away  by  Ravana,  Vaidehi,  seeing  none  who  would 
defend  her,  suddenly  observed  five  powerful  monkeys  standing 
on  the  summit  of  a  mountain. 

Thereupon  that  large-eyed  princess  of  surpassing  charms, 
let  fall  among  them  her  silken  mantle,  bright  as  gold  and  her 
rich  jewels.  Reflecting (  May  they  convey  the  tidings  to  Rama  *, 
the  beautiful  Sita  dropped  her  cloak  and  ornaments  in  their 
midst. 

In  his  anxiety  the  red-eyed  Dashagriva  did  not  observe  this 
proceeding  but  these  excellent  monkeys  beheld  the  large-eyed 
Sita,  who  did  not  move  her  eyelids  as  she  was  crying  out.1 
Then  that  Lord  of  the  Titans,  passing  beyond  the  Pampa  lake, 
his  face  turned  towards  Lanka,  continued  on  his  way,  clasping 
the  wailing  Maithili.  Although  experiencing  a  transport  of 
joy,  Ravana  in  truth  was  carrying  his  own  destruction  in  his 
arms,  like  a  sharp-toothed  and  poisonous  serpent. 

Coursing  through  the  air,  he  left  behind  forest,  rivers, 
mountains  and  lakes  and  speeding  on  like  an  arrow  shot  from, 
a  bow  he  passed  over  that  sanctuary  of  whales  and  crocodiles, 
the  indestructible  abode  of  Varuna,  the  refuge  of  rivers,  the 
ocean.  Beholding  Sita  borne  away,  the  waters  became  con- 
vulsed and  the  great  serpents  and  fish  were  startled. 

Then  the  voices  of  the  Charanas  and  Siddhas  could  be 
heard  in  the  sky,  saying :  "  The  end  of  Dashagriva  is  at 
hand  I  ".  Ravana  however,  who  symbolised  death  itself,  bear- 
ing the  struggling  Sita  in  his  lap,  entered  the  city  of  Lanka. 

Reaching  that  capital  with  its  broad  and  spacious  highways, 
he  entered  the  palace  and  penetrated  into  the  inner  appartments. 
It  was  there  that  the  dark-browed  Sita,  a  prey  to  grief  and 
despair,  was  set  down  by  Ravana  in  his  own  domain,  as  Maya 
sheds  his  illusion. 

1  Thus  not  betraying  her  intention  to  Ravana. 

114 


ARANYA    KANDA 

Then  Ravana  addressed  those  demons  of  dreadful  aspect, 
saying : — 

"  Let  none  look  on  Sita  without  mine  authority  !  It  is  my 
will  that  she  have  pearls,  rubies,  robes  and  ornaments  to  the 
extent  of  her  desire !  Whoever  speaks  harshly  to  her,  either 
knowingly  or  unknowingly,  will  forfeit  his  life ! " 

Having  spoken  thus  to  the  titan  women,  Ravana  left  the 
inner  apartment  and  began  to  reflect  on  what  more  should 
now  be  done. 

Observing  eight  valiant,  flesh-eating  titans,  that  exceedingly 
powerful  One,  blinded  by  the  boon  he  had  received,  after 
extolling  their  strength  and  heroism,  said  to  them : — 

"  Equipped  with  every  kind  of  weapon,  betake  yourselves 
with  all  speed  to  Janasthana,  where  Khara  formerly  dwelt  and, 
summoning  up  your  courage,  banishing  all  fear,  establish 
yourselves  in  that  place,  which  is  now  a  desert  on  account  of 
the  massacre  of  the  titans.  A  great  and  mighty  army  was 
entrenched  in  Janasthana,  which,  with  Khara  and  Dushana, 
was  destroyed  in  combat  with  Rama.  Since  that  time,  an 
inordinate  rage  which  I  am  unable  to  control  has  taken  possession 
of  me,  precluding  all  rest.  I  wish  to  avenge  myself  on  my 
sworn  enemy,  nor  shall  I  sleep  till  I  have  slain  him  in  fight. 
In  the  hour  that  I  bring  about  the  death  of  the  slayer  of  Khara 
and  Dushana,  I  shall  rejoice,  as  a  beggar  on  the  acquisition  of 
wealth. 

"  Established  in  Janasthana,  keep  me  scrupulously  informed 
concerning  Rama  and  his  movements.  Without  respite,  let 
the  Rangers  of  the  Night  take  action  and  constantly  strive  to 
bring  about  Rama's  end.  Being  acquainted  with  your  valour, 
which  I  have  often  witnessed  in  the  field,  I  have  chosen  you 
to  repair  to  Janasthana." 

Hearing  these  flattering  and  significant  words  of  Ravana's, 
those  titans,  bowing  down  to  him,  left  Lanka  in  a  body  and 
took  the  direction  of  Janasthana  in  all  haste,  having  first  made 
themselves  invisible. 

But  Ravana,  having  secured  Mithila's  daughter  and  brought 
her  to  the  palace,  though  he  had  thus  incurred  the  hostility 
of  Rama,  gave  himself  up  to  transports  of  senseless  joy.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    55 

Ravana  implores  Sita  to  become  his  Consort 

Having  issued  commands  to  those  eight  titans,  renowned  for 
their  prowess,  Ravana,  whose  perception  was  clouded,  con- 
sidered that  he  had  prepared  himself  for  every  eventuality. 

Brooding  on  Vaidehi,  sorely  pierced  by  the  shafts  of  the 
God  of  Love,  he  hastened  to  his  sumptuous  apartments, 
inflamed  with  desire  for  her  presence.  Entering  there,  Ravana, 
the  King  of  the  Titans,  observed  Sita  overcome  with  grief, 
surrounded  by  titan  women,  like  a  ship  foundering  in  the  sea 
at  the  mercy  of  a  storm  or  a  gazelle  separated  from  the  herd 
beset  by  hounds. 

Then  Ravana  approaching  that  princess,  whose  head  was 
bowed  and  who  was  disconsolate,  compelled  her  to  view  that 
mansion  resembling  the  abode  of  the  Gods,  containing  many 
storeys  and  spacious  apartments,  inhabited  by  innumerable 
women  and  enriched  by  countless  gems,  whilst  flocks  of  birds 
filled  it  with  their  carolling.  Graceful  pillars  of  gold,  ivory, 
crystal  and  silver,  encrusted  with  emeralds  and  diamonds 
could  be  seen  and  celestial  gongs  resounded  there. 

Ravana,  in  company  with  Sita,  ascended  the  magnificent 
golden  stairway,  ornamented  with  burnished  gold.  Those 
lofty  buildings  possessed  excellent  windows  of  gold  and  ivory 
covered  with  golden  trellises,  and  their  marble  floors  were 
inlaid  with  precious  stones  that  shed  their  lustre  everywhere. 
Then  Dashagriva  showed  Maithili  the  fountains  and  pools 
covered  with  lotuses  and  every  kind  of  flower ;  all  this  did 
he  bring  to  the  notice  of  Sita  who  was  overcome  with  grief ; 
and  after  directing  Vaidehi's  attention  to  the  splendours  of  the 
palace,  that  perverse  wretch,  with  the  intention  of  seducing  her, 
said: 

"  O  Sita,  apart  from  the  aged  and  the  children,  ten  thousand 
titans,  rangers  of  the  night,  all  of  whom  are  famed  for  their 
exploits,  acknowledge  me  as  their  lord,  and  each  among  them 
116 


ARANYA    KANDA 

has  placed  a  thousand  loyal  servants  at  my  disposal.  This 
entire  state,  as  also  my  life,  is  thine,  O  Large-eyed  Lady. 
Thou  art  dearer  to  me  than  life  itself!  O  Sita,  become  the 
queen  of  those  numerous  excellent  women  who  are  my  wives. 
O  Beloved,  be  my  consort,  it  is  to  thine  advantage.  What 
boots  it  to  consider  aught  else,  do  thou  give  my  proposal  thy 
consideration ;  it  behoves  thee  to  look  favourably  on  me,  who 
am  burning  with  desire. 

"  Surrounded  by  the  ocean,  this  city  of  Lanka,  extending 
for  a  hundred  yojanas,  can  never  be  taken  by  storm,  even  by 
the  Gods  themselves  with  Indra  at  their  head.  Among  the 
Celestials,  Yakshas,  Gandharvas  and  Nagas,  I  can  see  none 
in  all  the  worlds  equal  to  me  in  prowess.  Deprived  of  his 
kingdom,  without  possessions,  dedicated  to  ascetic  practices, 
travelling  on  foot,  what  canst  thou  hope  from  Rama,  a  mere 
man  without  resources  ? 

"  O  Sita,  I  am  a  consort  worthy  of  thee,  do  thou  accept  me ; 
youth  soon  passes,  O  Darling ;  enjoy  these  delights  with  me. 
O  Lady  of  charming  mien,  do  not  think  of  seeing  Raghava 
again.  How  could  he  come  hither  even  in  thought?  Who 
can  fetter  the  impetuous  wind  in  the  sky  or  seize  the  pure 
flame  of  a  brazier  ?  None  in  the  Three  Worlds  may  snatch 
thee  from  mine  arms.  Do  thou  rule  over  this  vast  empire  of 
Lanka  and  all  beings,  animate  and  inanimate ;  even  I  and  the 
Gods  shall  be  thy  servants.  Laving  thyself  in  the  crystal  waters, 
be  happy  and  live  in  delight.  Thy  former  evil  karma  has  been 
expiated  by  the  time  passed  by  thee  in  the  forest.  It  is  here 
that  thou  wilt  be  able  to  pluck  the  fruit  of  thy  good  deeds. 
In  my  company,  O  Maithili,  enjoy  these  garlands  with  their 
divine  fragrance  and  these  magnificent  ornaments.  With  me 
do  thou  disport  thyself  in  the  aerial  chariot  Fuskpaka,  bright 
as  the  sun,  that  was  once  Vaishravana's,  which  I  won  by  my 
prowess  in  combat,  that  vast  and  beautiful  car,  swift  as  thought. 

"  Thy  countenance,  flawless  and  lovely  to  look  upon,  pure 
as  a  lotus,  is  wan  on  account  of  sorrow  and  has  lost  its  radiance, 
O  Lady  of  lovely  limbs  and  gracious  features." 

Whilst  he  was  speaking,  the  beautiful  Sita  covered  her  face 
that  sparkled  like  the  moon  with  the  hem  of  her  robe  and 
allowed  her  tears  to  flow. 


THE    RAMAYANA     OF    VALMIKI 

Thereat  the  sinful  Ravana,  that  Ranger  of  the  Night, 
addressed  Sita  who  was  sunk  in  thought  and  forlorn,  her 
cheeks  pale  on  account  of  grief,  saying : — 

"  O  Vaidehi,  do  not  fear  to  contravene  dharma ;  the  cere- 
mony that  shall  consecrate  our  union  is  sanctioned  by  the 
Veda  !  I  press  thy  tender  feet  with  my  heads ;  grant  my  prayer 
speedily  !  I  am  thy  slave  and  ever  obedient  to  thee !  May 
these  words,  inspired  by  the  torments  of  love,  not  prove  fruit- 
less ;  never  before  has  Ravana  bowed  his  head  before  a  woman." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Maithili,  the  daughter  of  Janaka, 
Dashagriva  under  the  sway  of  destiny,  thought :  "  She  is 
minel " 


CHAPTER    56 

Sita  is  guarded  by  the  Titan  Women 

Hearing  these  words,  Vaidehi,  though  still  distressed,  ceased 
to  tremble  and  placed  a  blade  of  grass  between  herself  and 
Ravana,  saying : — 

"  King  Dasaratha,  the  indestructible  rampart  of  justice, 
whose  piety  brought  him  renown,  had  a  son,  Raghava. 
Famed  in  the  Three  Worlds,  that  virtuous  one,  possessed  of 
powerful  arms  and  large  eyes,  is  my  God  and  my  lord.  It 
is  he,  that  hero,  born  in  the  House  of  Ikshwaku,  illustrious, 
possessing  shoulders  like  unto  a  lion's,  who,  with  his  brother 
Lakshmana  will  rob  thee  of  thy  life ! 

"  Hadst  thou  laid  violent  hands  on  me  in  his  presence,  he 
would  have  compelled  thee  to  refrain  and  would  have  slain 
thee  in  single  combat,  even  as  he  slew  Rhara  himself  in 
Janasthana.  Those  titans  of  grim  visage,  whom  thou  dost 
extol  to  me,  valiant  though  they  be,  would  be  deprived  of  their 
power  in  Raghava's  presence,  as  serpents  yield  up  their  poison 
before  Suparna.  Those  golden  shafts,  loosed  from  the  string 
of  Rama's  bow,  would  pierce  their  bodies,  as  the  Ganges 
bears  away  her  banks !  Though  thou  mayest  not  be  slain  by 
118 


ARANYA    KANDA 
Asuras  or  Gods,  yet  now  that  thou  hast  incurred  the  fury  of 
Raghava,  thou  wilt  not  escape  alive. 

"  Thou  hast  but  a  short  time  to  live !  Raghava  will  compass 
thine  end !  That  life  which  thou  deemest  impossible  to  lose 
is  as  a  beast's  bound  to  the  sacrificial  stake  !  If  Rama  lets  fall 
on  thee  his  glance  inflamed  with  ire,  thou  wilt  instantly  be 
consumed,  O  Titan,  as  Mamatha  by  Rudra !  He,  who  is  able 
to  bring  down  the  moon  from  the  skies  and  destroy  it  or  dry 
up  the  ocean,  is  assuredly  able  to  deliver  Sita.  Thy  life,  thy 
prosperity,  thy  being  and  faculties  are  forfeit ;  Lanka,  bereft 
of  its  inhabitants,  will  be  left  desolate  through  thy  fault.  Nay, 
this  outrage  will  bring  thee  nought  but  misfortune,  O  Thou 
who  in  the  absence  of  my  lord  didst  bear  me  away  by  force, 
never  more  wilt  thou  know  felicity  ! 

"  My  illustrious  lord,  accompanied  by  his  brother,  depend- 
ing on  his  own  energy,  does  not  fear  to  live  in  the  Dandaka 
Forest.  Thy  prowess,  thy  strength,  thine  arrogance  and  thy 
presumption,  will  all  be  wiped  out  under  the  rain  of  his  shafts 
in  battle.  When  the  hour,  appointed  by  destiny  for  the 
destruction  of  beings,  is  at  hand,  they  become  mad  under  its 
sway.  Mine  abduction  presages  thine  end  and  that  of  the 
titans  and  of  those  dwelling  in  the  inner  apartments.  As  an 
untouchable  may  not  approach  the  sacred  altar,  furnished  with 
ladles  and  vessels  of  worship  at  the  time  of  sacrifice,  so  the 
legitimate  spouse  of  one  fixed  in  virtue,  faithful  to  his  vows, 
may  not  be  approached  by  a  sinner  such  as  thou,  O  Last  of 
the  Titans ! 

"  How  should  a  royal  swan,  sporting  amidst  the  tufts  of 
lotuses  with  her  mate,  concern  herself  with  a  cormorant  on  the 
bank  ?  Bind  or  destroy  this  insentient  body1,  I  have  neither 
desire  to  preserve  it  nor  my  life,  O  Titan,  for  I  will  never 
submit  to  dishonour." 

After  speaking  thus  in  her  wrath,  causing  the  blood  to  freeze, 
Vaidehi  became  silent,  and  Ravana  answered  her  in  menacing 
tones,  saying :  "  Reflect  well,  O  Lovely  Princess ;  if  thou 
dost  not  yield  to  me  within  the  period  of  twelve  months,  my 
cooks  shall  cut  thee  to  pieces  for  my  morning  repast." 

1  Implyingthat  the  bodyitself  is  inanimate  when  not  energised  by  Conscious- 
ness. 

119 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Having  spoken  thus,  Ravana,  the  Challenger  of  His  Foes, 
exceedingly  wroth,  addressed  those  female  titans  in  these 
words : — 

"  Ye  terrible  demons  of  ferocious  aspect,  who  subsist  on 
flesh  and  blood,  do  ye  instantly  crush  the  pride  of  this  woman!  " 

When  he  had  said  this,  those  monsters  of  fearful  aspect,  joining 
hands,  surrounded  Maithili,  and  Ravana  commanded  those 
women,  formidable  to  look  upon,  who  walking  struck  the  earth 
with  such  force  that  it  shook,  saying : — 

"  Do  yc  take  Maithili  to  the  centre  of  the  Ashoka  grove,  and 
there,  encircling  her  mount  guard  over  her  secretly,  and  some- 
times by  menaces  and  at  others  by  soft  speech  seek  in  every 
way  to  break  her  will,  as  one  would  a  female  elephant." 

Thus  commanded  by  Ravana,  those  titan  woman,  taking 
hold  of  Maithili,  dragged  her  to  the  Ashoka  grove  which  was 
planted  with  trees  covered  with  flowers  of  every  kind  and 
many  fruits,  able  to  satisfy  every  desire,  where  birds  disported 
themselves  in  love. 

And,  as  a  gazelle  in  the  midst  of  tigresses,  Sita,  the  daughter 
of  Janaka,  her  limbs  giving  way  under  her  despair,  fell  under 
the  sway  of  those  titans. 

Like  a  timid  antelope  taken  in  a  snare,  Maithili,  the  daughter 
of  Janaka,  overwhelmed  with  grief  and  fear,  could  find  no 
relief.  And  threatened  by  those  terrible  monsters,  the  Princess 
of  Mithila,  unable  to  rest,  remembering  her  lord  and  beloved 
brother-in-law,  under  the  weight  of  terror  and  sorrow,  swooned 
away. 


CHAPTER     57 

Rama  sees  Terrible  Portents 

Having  slain  Maricha,  that  titan  able  to  change  his  shape  at 
will  who  wandered  about  in  the  form  of  a  deer,  Rama  took 
bis  way  back  to  the  hermitage  with  all  speed,  eager  to  behold 
Maithili  and,  as  he  hastened  on,  jackals  began  to  howl  mourn- 
fully behind  him.    Hearing  those  dismal  sounds,  causing  him 


ARANYA    KANDA 

to  tremble,  Rama,  seized  with  alarm,  reflected  :  "  Is  Vaidehi 
safe  and  well  or  has  she  become  a  prey  to  the  titans  ?  The 
cry  raised  by  Marietta  in  the  guise  of  a  deer,  imitating  my 
voice,  if  heard  by  Lakshmana,  may  cause  htm  to  leave  Sita 
in  order  to  come  to  mine  aid !  It  may  be  that  the  titans  have 
resolved  to  slay  Sita  and  for  this  reason  Maricha,  in  the  form 
of  a  gazelle,  lured  me  away !  Having  brought  me  a  great 
distance,  that  titan  fell  a  victim  to  my  shafts  and  feigning  my 
voice,  cried  out :  *  O  Lakshmana,  I  am  slain  !  *  Is  all  well 
with  them,  deprived  of  my  presence  in  the  forest  ?  On  account 
of  Janasthana,  I  have  rendered  myself  hateful  to  the  titans, 
and  many  and  dreadful  are  the  portents  I  now  see  around  me." 

Reflecting  thus  on  hearing  the  jackals'  cries,  Rama  hurriedly 
made  his  way  towards  the  hermitage,  pondering  on  the  means 
adopted  by  the  titan  in  assuming  the  form  of  a  deer  to  lure 
him  far  away  from  his  dear  ones. 

Directing  his  steps  towards  Janasthana,  his  heart  filled  with 
apprehension,  he  observed  the  birds  and  beasts  passing  to  his 
left,  emitting  fearful  cries,  and  witnessing  these  dreadful 
signs  Raghava  beheld  Lakshmana  approaching,  pale  of  mien. 
Already  a  prey  to  anxiety,  Rama  became  even  more  distressed 
on  seeing  his  brother  thus  cast  down. 

Observing  that  he  had  left  Sita  alone  in  the  solitary  wood 
frequented  by  titans,  taking  Lakshmana  by  the  left  hand,  he 
spoke  to  him  in  a  gentle  voice,  in  sad  and  reproachful  tones, 
saying : — 

"  Ah !  Lakshmana,  thou  hast  done  wrong  to  come 
hither,  leaving  Sita  unprotected.  O  My  Friend,  how  can  this 
prove  auspicious  ?  Assuredly  the  daughter  of  Janaka  has  been 
slain  or  even  devoured  by  the  titans  who  range  the  woods ! 
Since  so  many  evil  portents  have  appeared  to  me,  O  Lakshmana, 
I  question  whether  we  shall  find  Sita,  the  daughter  of  Janaka, 
alive,  O  Lion  among  Men !  Since  this  multitude  of  beasts  and 
jackals  are  emitting  fearful  cries  and  the  birds  also,  as  they 
fly  towards  the  south,  I  fear  that  all  is  not  well  with  that  king's 
daughter,  O  Hero  of  great  prowess  ! 

"  That  titan,  wearing  the  form  of  a  deer,  deceived  me  and 
drew  me  far  from  the  hermitage.  Having  slain  him  with 
difficulty.,  at  the  point  of  death,  he  revealed  himself  to  me  in 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

his  true  form.  My  heart  is  heavy  and  bereft  of  all  delight, 
and  my  left  eye  throbs.  Undoubtedly,  O  Lakshmana,  Sita 
is  no  longer  there  and  has  either  been  carried  away  or  is  dead 
or  lost  in  the  forest." 


CHAPTER    58 

Rama's  Lament 

Seeing  Lakshmana,  cast  down  and  dejected,  approaching 
without  Vaidehi,  the  virtuous  son  of  Dasaratha  enquired  of 
him,  saying : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  where  is  Vaidehi,  who  followed  me  to  the 
Dandaka  Forest  and  whom  thou  hast  left  alone  to  come  hither? 
Where  is  that  one  of  graceful  form,  the  companion  of  my 
misfortune  when  I  was  banished  from  my  kingdom  and, 
dispirited,  roamed  the  Dandaka  Forest ;  where  is  Sita,  without 
whom  I  cannot  live  for  an  instant,  my  life's  companion,  who 
resembled  a  daughter  of  the  Gods  ? 

"  O  Hero,  separated  from  that  daughter  of  Janaka,  whose 
skin  was  like  gold,  I  have  neither  a  desire  for  the  sovereignty 
of  the  Gods  or  the  earth.  O  Lakshmana,  Sita  is  dearer  to  me 
than  life  itself.  O  Saumitri,  has  my  banishment  been  rendered 
void  ?  If,  on  account  of  Sita,  I  should  die  and  thou  return 
to  the  city  alone,  will  it  not  prove  the  consummation  of  Kaikeyi's 
desires  and  she  find  felicity  ?  Will  not  Kaushalya,  her  son 
dead,  become  the  abject  slave  of  Kaikeyi  when,  having  accom- 
plished her  design,  she  rules  the  dominion  with  her  son? 
If  Vaidehi  still  lives,  I  will  return  to  the  hermitage,  but  if  my 
virtuous  spouse  be  dead,  I  shall  yield  up  my  life,  O  Lakshmana! 
If  on  returning  to  the  ashrama  the  daughter  of  Videha,  whose 
words  were  ever  preceded  by  a  smile,  does  not  speak  to  me, 
I  shall  renounce  my  life. 

"  Tell  me,  O  Lakshmana,  if  Vaidehi  is  living  or  no,  or  whether 
in  consequence  of  thy  leaving  her  that  unfortunate  creature 
has  been  devoured  by  the  titans.  Alas !  The  wretched  Sita, 
so  tender  and  fragile,  never  having  experienced  unhappiness, 


ARANYA    KANDA 

will  be  wholly  desolate  in  mine  absence.  Did  that  titan,  full 
of  cunning  and  craft,  crying  out  *  O  Lakshmana ',  inspire  thee 
with  fear  ?  I  surmise  that  Vaidehi,  hearing  that  cry  for  help 
uttered  in  a  voice  resembling  mine,  besought  thee  to  find  out 
what  had  become  of  me  and  thou  didst  come  hither  with  all 
speed.  Thou  hast  done  an  irretrievable  wrong  in  abandoning 
Sita  in  the  forest,  thus  affording  those  cruel  and  ruthless  titans 
an  opportunity  for  avenging  themselves.  Those  flesh-eating 
demons  are  aggrieved  on  account  of  Khara's  death  and  now, 
without  doubt,  have  slain  Sita.  Alas  !  I  am  wholly  submerged 
in  an  ocean  of  sorrow,  O  Destroyer  of  thy  Foes  !  What  shall 
I  do  now ;  I  tremble  before  that  which  awaits  me  !  " 

Thus  immersed  in  the  thought  of  Sita,  that  paragon  among 
women,  Raghava  hastened  towards  Janasthana  in  company 
with  Lakshmana. 

Heaping  reproaches  on  his  younger  brother,  who  was  over- 
whelmed with  distress,  tormented  by  hunger,  fatigue  and 
thirst,  Rama,  sighing  heavily,  his  countenance  pale,  a  prey  to 
despair,  entered  his  hermitage  and  found  it  deserted. 

Returning  to  the  ashrama,  that  hero  ran  hither  and  thither 
where  Sita  was  wont  to  disport  herself  and,  recollecting  those 
haunts  where  she  used  to  roam,  he  became  distracted,  his 
hair  standing  on  end. 


CHAPTER     59 

Rama  reproaches  Lakshmana 

Issuing  from  the  hermitage,  Rama,  the  Delight  of  the  House 
of  Raghu,  continued  to  address  Lakshmana  in  a  faint  voice, 
saying : — 

"  Having  confided  Maithili  to  thy  care  during  mine  absence 
in  the  forest,  why  didst  thou  abandon  her  ?  Seeing  thee  appear 
alone,  having  left  Maithili  unprotected,  my  spirit  was  troubled, 
apprehending  grave  danger.  O  Lakshmana,  watching  thee 
approach  from  a  distance  unaccompanied  by  Sita,  my  left  eye 
and  arm  twitched  and  my  heart  throbbed." 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

At  these  words,  the  son  of  Sumitra,  who  bore  the  marks  of 
royalty,  was  seized  with  distress  and  said  to  the  stricken  Rama: — 

"  Nay,  it  was  not  of  myself  that  I  came  hither,  nor  of  mine 
own  inclination  that  I  left  Sita  and  set  out  to  meet  thee,  but 
I  was  urged  thereto  by  her  entreaties  to  come  to  thine  aid. 

"  The  cry,  '  O  Lakshmana,  save  me !  *  as  if  uttered  by  her 
lord,  broke  on  Maithili's  ears  and  she,  hearing  this  despairing 
call,  from  affection  for  thee,  weeping  and  filled  with  terror, 
said  unto  me :  *  Go !  Go !  *.  While  she  thus  continued  to 
urge  me,  repeating  *  Go ',  I  spoke  to  her,  seeking  to  reassure 
her,  saying  :  '  I  know  of  no  titan  who  can  excite  Rama's  fear ; 
it  is  not  he,  but  another  who  calls,  O  Sita.  How  should  that 
illustrious  warrior,  the  inspirer  of  awe  in  the  Gods  themselves, 
utter  so  base  and  shameful  a  word  as  *  save  me  *  ?  Who  has 
imitated  the  voice  of  my  brother  and  pronounced  these  cowardly 
words  and  for  what  motive?  Assuredly  it  is  a  demon  who, 
in  his  extremity,  has  uttered  the  cry,  *  Help  ! '.  O  Lovely  One, 
it  does  not  become  thee  to  tremble  like  a  low-born  woman ! 
Take  courage,  calm  thyself  and  banish  thine  anxiety.  There 
is  none  born,  nor  yet  to  be  born  in  the  Three  Worlds,  who  is 
able  to  triumph  over  Raghava  in  the  field  in  open  fight.  He  is 
incapable  of  being  defeated  in  combat,  even  by  the  Gods 
with  Indra  at  their  head.' 

"  Thus  addressed  by  me,  Vaidehi,  distracted  and  shedding 
tears,  uttered  these  cruel  words  : — 

" '  O  Lakshmana,  in  thine  extreme  perversity  thou  seekest 
to  unite  thyself  with  me  on  the  death  of  thy  brother  but  thou 
shalt  never  possess  me !  It  is  on  Bharata's  instigation  that 
thou  hast  accompanied  Rama,  since,  despite  his  despairing 
cry,  thou  dost  not  go  to  his  aid.  Concealing  thy  true  purpose, 
thou  hast  treacherously  followed  Rama  for  my  sake  and  for 
this  reason  dost  refuse  to  assist  him.' 

"  Hearing  Vaidehi's  words,  I  left  the  hermitage,  my  lips 
trembling,  mine  eyes  inflamed  with  wrath." 

When  Saumitri  had  spoken  thus,  Rama,  who  was  distracted 
with  anxiety,  said  to  him :  "  O  Friend,  thou  hast  done  a 
great  wrong  by  coming  hither  without  Sita.  Thou  knowest 
well  that  1  am  able  to  defend  myself  against  the  titans,  yet  on 
account  of  a  hasty  word  thou  didst  abandon  Vaidehi. 
1*4 


ARANYA    KANDA 

"  I  am  not  pleased  that  thou  didst  leave  her  nor  that  thou 
hast  come  here  on  account  of  the  reproaches  of  an  indignant 
woman.  Submitting  to  Sita  and  giving  way  to  the  impulse  of 
anger  has  caused  thee  to  contravene  the  spiritual  law  and 
disobey  my  command. 

"  That  titan  who  assumed  the  form  of  a  deer  in  order  to 
lure  me  from  the  hermitage  now  lies  stricken  by  mine  arrows. 
Stretching  my  bow,  I  placed  an  arrow  on  it  and  loosed  it,  as 
it  were  in  sport,  laying  him  low. 

"  Discarding  his  deer's  form  and  assuming  the  shape  of  a 
titan  adorned  with  bracelets,  he  emitted  cries  of  agony ;  there- 
after feigning  my  voice,  in  accents  capable  of  being  heard  afar 
off,  he  called  out,  and  on  hearing  that  sinister  cry  thou  didst 
abandon  Maithili  and  came  hither." 


chapter    60 

The  Search  for  Sita 

As  Rama  hastened  on,  his  left  eye  began  to  twitch ;  he  stumbled 
and  was  seized  with  a  fit  of  trembling.  Observing  these  in- 
auspicious signs,  he  enquired  repeatedly  of  Lakshmana : — 
"  Can  all  be  well  with  Sita  ?  " 

Eager  to  see  her  again,  he  quickened  his  pace  and  hastened 
on,  but  when  he  reached  the  hermitage,  he  found  it  deserted 
and,  filled  with  apprehension,  began  to  run  hither  and  thither, 
searching  everywhere.  To  that  descendant  of  Kaghu,  his 
thatched  hut,  without  Sita,  appeared  like  a  lake  bereft  of  lotuses, 
shorn  of  its  beauty  at  the  end  of  summer. 

Seeing  the  deserted  hermitage,  with  its  trees  that  seemed  to 
be  weeping,  its  flowers  faded,  the  deer  and  the  birds  melancholy, 
bereft  of  charm,  wholly  desolate,  the  forest  Deities  having 
forsaken  it,  the  mats  and  deer-skins  lying  here  and  there,  the 
grassy  seats  withered  and  trampled  upon,  Rama  began  to 
weep  and  cry  out : — 

125 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Hath  that  timid  one  been  carried  away  or  killed  or  devoured 
or  is  she  drowned  or  has  she  hidden  herself  in  the  forest  ? 
Perchance  she  has  not  yet  returned  from  gathering  fruit  and 
flowers  or  she  has  gone  to  bring  back  water  from  the  pools 
or  the  river  ?  " 

Faint  with  seeking,  without  finding  any  trace  of  his  beloved 
in  the  forest,  running  from  tree  to  tree,  scaling  the  hills,  search- 
ing by  river  and  stream,  lamenting  the  while  and  overcome 
with  grief,  he  appeared  like  one  struggling  in  a  morass ! 

"  O  Kedumbra  Tree  ",  he  cried,  "  hast  thou  not  seen  my 
dear  one,  who  cherished  thee  ?  If  thou  knowest  aught,  then 
tell  me  where  the  lovely  Sita  can  be  found  ?  O  Bilwa  Tree ! 
Say  hast  thou  seen  her,  who  wears  a  silken  robe,  who  is  as 
fair  as  the  young  green  shoots  and  whose  breasts  resemble 
thy  fruit  ?  Or  thou,  O  Arjuna  Tree  !  Give  me  tidings  of  the 
one  who  loved  thee,  that  daughter  of  Janaka;  dost  that  frail 
creature  still  live  ?  This  Kadubha  Tree  knoweth  for  certain 
of  Maithili,  whose  thighs  resemble  its  fruit,  and  here  stands  the 
beautiful  Vanaspati  enveloped  in  flowering  creepers,  buds  and 
leaves,  in  whose  shade  the  bees  hum,  undoubtedly  thou  art 
the  crown  of  trees  !  Surely  this  Tilaka  who  loved  Sita  knows 
where  she  is  now  I  O  Ashoka  Tree,  dispeller  of  grief,  prove 
the  truth  of  thy  name  and  allay  the  pain  pressing  on  my  heart 
by  disclosing  my  loved  one  to  me  without  delay.  O  Tala  Tree, 
have  pity  on  me  and  if  thou  hast  seen  that  fair  damsel,  whose 
breasts  resemble  thy  ripe  fruit,  do  thou  tell  me !  O  Jambu 
Tree,  if  thou  hast  seen  my  dear  love,  whose  radiance  resembles 
the  Jambunada,  then  speak  without  fear,  and  thou,  the  first  of 
the  Karnikara  trees,  whose  flowers  are  of  surpassing  loveliness, 
O  Gentle  One,  say,  hast  thou  seen  my  Beloved  ?  ** 

Thus  did  the  illustrious  Rama  question  every  tree,  Cuta, 
Nipa,  giant  Sala,  Panasa,  Kuravasa,  also  Vakula,  Punnaga, 
Candana  and  Ketaka  trees,  running  hither  and  thither  in  the 
forest  like  one  demented. 

Thereafter  he  addressed  the  beasts,  saying :  "  O  Deer,  do 
ye  not  know  where  Maithili  is  to  be  found,  whose  eyes  resembled 
a  gazelle's,  who  with  her  doe-like  glances  was  followed  by  the 
fawns  she  had  tamed  ?  O  Elephant,  methinks  thou  dost  know 
her,  whose  thighs  resembled  thy  trunk :  pray  tell  me,  hast 
126 


ARANYA    KANDA 

thou  seen  her  ?  0  Tiger,  if  thou  hast  seen  my  gentle  spouse, 
whose  countenance  resembled  the  moon  in  radiance,  then  tell 
me  fearlessly. 

"  Why  art  thou  hiding,  O  My  Beloved  ?  I  see  thee,  O  Lotus- 
eyed  One !  Do  not  conceal  thyself  amidst  the  trees  without 
replying !  Stay !  Stay !  O  Princess  of  lovely  Limbs,  hast 
thou  no  pity  for  me?  Why  dost  thou  mock  me?  It  is  not 
thy  nature  to  yield  thyself  to  this  folly,  O  Lady  of  Fair  Com- 
plexion, it  is  vain  for  thee  to  fly  me,  thy  yellow  sari  renders 
thee  easily  distinguishable,  I  have  seen  thee !  Stay,  if  thou 
hast  any  love  for  me  !  Alas  !  It  is  not  she — my  Sita  of  gracious 
smiles !  Without  doubt,  she  has  perished  since  my  grief 
leaves  her  unmoved ! 

"  Assuredly  that  youthful  woman  has  been  devoured  in 
mine  absence ;  Sita,  with  her  lovely  countenance,  exquisite 
teeth  and  lips,  shapely  nose  and  beautiful  earrings,  whose  skin 
resembles  the  winter  jasmine,  has  perished,  and  her  beauty  is 
extinguished,  as  the  full  moon  under  eclipse.  The  slender 
neck  of  my  well-beloved,  of  the  hue  of  sandal,  adorned  with 
a  necklace,  has  been  devoured,  like  that  of  one  poor  and 
helpless,  possessing  neither  kith  nor  kin. 

"  O  Mighty-armed  One,  dost  thou  not  see  my  loved  one 
anywhere  ?  O  Where  hast  thou  gone,  O  Sita,  O  My  Lovely 
One?" 

Thus  did  Rama  lament,  and  calling,  ran  from  grove  to  grove, 
sometimes  turning  like  a  whirlwind,  sometimes  appearing  like 
one  who  has  lost  his  wits.  Intent  on  finding  his  love,  ranging 
the  forest,  scaling  the  mountain,  exploring  the  rivers  and 
waterfalls,  he  sped  through  the  woodlands  without  rest. 

Searching  on  every  side  without  pause,  seeking  Maithili 
throughout  the  forest,  hoping  to  find  his  Beloved,  he  became 
utterly  exhausted. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER     6  I 

Rama's  Plaint 

Seeing  the  hermitage  and  the  hut  deserted,  with  the  grassy 
seats  strewn  here  and  there  and  not  finding  Vaidehi  anywhere, 
Rama,  the  son  of  Dararatha,  lifting  up  his  beautiful  arms, 
uttered  these  sorrowful  words  : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  where  is  Vaidehi,  where  has  she  gone  ? 
O  Saumitri,  who  has  carried  away  or  devoured  my  dearest 
one  ?  O  Sita,  if  thou  hast  concealed  thyself  behind  a  tree  and 
art  mocking  me,  then  bring  this  jest  to  an  end ;  thou  hast 
enjoyed  my  distress  long  enough !  O  Darling,  the  young 
gazelles  with  whom  thou  didst  play,  languish  in  thine  absence, 
their  eyes  filled  with  tears.  Without  Sita  I  cannot  live,  O 
Lakshmana,  I  am  overwhelmed  with  grief  on  account  of  her 
abduction.  To-day  I  shall  rejoin  that  great  monarch,  my  sire, 
in  the  other  world,  who  will  reproach  me,  saying :  *  How 
comes  it  that  thou,  having  left  me  in  order  to  redeem  my 
vow,  art  come  hither  before  the  appointed  time  ?  O  Slave  of 
thy  desires,  thou  art  bereft  of  honour  and  loyalty,  woe  unto 
thee!* 

"  Without  doubt,  thus  will  my  father  address  me  in  the 
other  region !  O  Cruel  One !  distracted  as  I  am  and  over- 
whelmed with  sorrow,  thou  hast  deserted  me,  as  a  fair  name 
parts  company  with  a  swindler !  O  Lovely  Princess,  do  not 
leave  me !  O  Slender-waisted  Lady,  in  the  abyss  in  which 
thou  hast  plunged  me,  I  shall  yield  up  my  life !  " 

Thus  did  Rama  lament,  desiring  to  behold  Sita  once  more, 
but  the  unfortunate  Raghava  could  not  see  the  daughter  of 
Janaka  anywhere.  Sunk  in  misery  on  account  of  Sita,  he 
resembled  a  mighty  elephant  trapped  in  marshy  ground  in 
which  it  has  set  foot. 

Then  Lakshmana  in  his  ardent  desire  to  console  him  said: — 

"  O  Hero,  O  Mine  of  Wisdom,  do  not  grieve !    Let  us 

unitedly  put  forth  our  endeavours.    This  hill  is  famed  for  its 

many  caves,  and    Maitbili,  who,  enamoured  of  the  woods 

often  wandered  in  these  thickets,  has  doubtless  ventured  into 

128 


AJRANYA    KANDA 

the  deep  forest  or  visited  the  lake  covered  with  lotuses  in  bloom 
or  she  has  gone  to  the  river  filled  with  fish  and  frequented  by 
birds  of  beautiful  plumage.  Perchance  she  has  hidden  herself 
in  the  gorge  to  frighten  us  and  to  see  if  we  will  search  her  out. 
O  Lion  among  Men,  let  us  seek  her  without  delay  !  O  Fortunate 
Prince,  if  thou  deemest  her  to  be  somewhere  in  the  forest,  we 
will  leave  no  quarter  unexplored  ;  do  not  grieve,  O  Kakutstha!" 

These  words  of  Lakshmana,  inspired  by  fraternal  affection, 
comforted  Rama,  who  with  Saumitri  began  to  search  for  Sita 
once  more  with  a  tranquil  heart.  But  ranging  the  woods, 
hills,  rivers  and  lakes  on  every  side,  searching  the  plateaus, 
caves  and  summits  of  the  mountain,  those  two  sons  of  Dasaratha 
could  not  find  Sita  anywhere,  and  having  sought  her  in  every 
part  of  that  mountain  Rama  said  to  Lakshmana : — 

"  I  see  no  trace  of  the  lovely  Vaidehi  on  this  mountain,  O 
Saumitri ! " 

Then  Lakshmana  in  great  distress  addressed  his  brother, 
who  was  endowed  with  flaming  energy,  saying : — "  It  is  by 
ranging  the  Dandaka  Forest  that  thou  wilt  be  re-united  with 
Maithili,  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  O  Sagacious  One,  as  Vishnu 
covered  the  earth  on  subduing  Bali." 

Being  thus  addressed  by  the  valiant  Lakshmana,  Raghava, 
whose  heart  was  heavy  with  sorrow,  answered  in  piteous 
accents,  saying : — 

"  The  whole  forest  has  been  searched  with  care  by  us  and 
the  lakes  where  the  lotus  blooms  and  this  mountain  with  its 
many  caves  and  waterfalls  also,  O  Prudent  Prince,  yet  no  trace  of 
Vaidehi  who  is  dearer  to  me  than  my  life's  breath  can  I  find." 

Thus  mourning,  Rama,  overcome  by  anxiety,  his  heart 
contracted  with  grief,  in  an  excess  of  anguish,  swooned  away. 
Trembling  in  every  limb,  his  mind  bewildered,  stunned  and 
broken,  that  unhappy  prince  heaving  deep  and  burning  sighs,  in 
a  voice  strangled  with  sobs,  cried  out :  "  O  Sita,  O  My  Beloved ! " 

Thereupon  Lakshmana,  distracted  with  anxiety,  sought  to 
console  his  dear  brother  by  every  means,  standing  before  him 
with  joined  palms. 

But  Rama  gave  no  heed  to  the  words  that  fell  from 
Lakshmana's  lips  and,  not  beholding  his  dear  Sita,  continued 
to  call  upon  her  again  and  again. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER     62 

His  Despair 

In  the  absence  of  Sita,  the  lotus-eyed,  righteous  and  mighty 
Rama,  his  mind  distraught  with  suffering,  tortured  by  love  for 
her,  though  unable  to  see  her,  with  bitter  sighs,  reproached  her 
as  if  she  were  present,  saying : — 

"  O  Thou,  whose  youthful  flowering  is  more  graceful  than 
the  Ashoka  branches,  do  not  conceal  thyself  and  increase  my 
pain  !  O  Darling !  Thy  thighs  resemble  the  plaintain  boughs 
which  conceal  thee,  yet,  O  Goddess,  thou  canst  not  hide  from 
me !  Laughing,  thou  hast  taken  refuge  in  the  Karnikara  grove, 
but  enough  of  this  jesting  which  is  torturing  me !  It  is  not 
fitting  to  sport  thus  in  a  hermitage,  though  I  know  laughter 
to  be  natural  to  thee,  O  Darling !  Return,  O  Large-eyed 
Damsel,  thy  hut  is  desolate  ! 

'*  Alas  !  It  is  certain  that  those  titans  have  devoured  my 
Sita  or  borne  her  away  and  it  is  for  this  reason  that  she  does 
not  appear ;  she  would  never  mock  me  thus  in  my  sorrow, 
O  Lakshmana ! 

"  O  Saumitri,  observe  these  deer  from  whose  eyes  the  tears 
fall  and  who  seem  to  say  that  Sita  has  been  devoured  by  those 
Rangers  of  the  Night.  O  Noble  Lady,  where  hast  thou  gone  ? 
O  My  Chaste  One,  my  Lovely  One !  Alas !  The  desires  of 
Kaikeyi  are  fulfilled  to-day !  I  went  into  exile  with  Sita  and 
shall  now  return  alone.  How  shall  I  enter  the  palace  of  the 
queens  bereft  of  her  presence  ?  Will  not  the  people  say : 
*  He  is  a  heartless  wretch  !  * 

"  By  the  loss  of  Sita,  I  shall  bear  the  stigma  of  cowardice 
and  when  my  exile  is  over,  Janaka,  the  King  of  Mithila,  will 
enquire  of  me  as  to  our  welfare.  How  shall  I  answer  him  ? 
The  Sovereign  of  Videha,  seeing  me  return  without  Sita,  will 
be  overwhelmed  with  grief  on  account  of  her  death  and  become 
a  prey  to  madness ! 

130 


ARANYA    KANDA 

"  No,  I  will  never  return  to  Ayodhya  ruled  over  by  Bharata  ; 
heaven  itself  would  prove  a  desert  without  Sita.  Do  thou 
leave  me  in  the  forest  and  return  to  the  opulent  city  of  Ayodhya. 
As  for  me,  I  cannot  live  anywhere  without  Sita.  Embracing 
Bharata  tenderly,  say  to  him  in  my  name :  *  It  is  Rama's 
command  that  thou  rule  the  earth.*  Making  obeisance  to  our 
mothers,  Kaikeyi,  Sumitra  and  Kaushalya,  with  due  respect, 
protect  them  with  all  thy  might,  taking  counsel  of  the  wise. 
O  Destroyer  of  Thy  Foes,  it  is  for  thee  to  recount  to  them  the 
death  of  Sita  and  mine  own,  in  every  detail." 

Thus  did  Raghava  lament,  while  ranging  the  forest  full  of 
distress,  far  from  Sita  of  lovely  locks,  whilst  Lakshmana,  his 
features  blanched  with  terror,  felt  himself  about  to  lose  his 
reason  in  the  excess  of  his  grief. 


CHAPTER    63 

He  continues  to  lament 

That  son  of  a  king,  stricken  with  sorrow  and  a  prey  to  anxiety, 
separated  from  his  dear  one,  having  caused  his  brother  distress, 
fell  into  deeper  and  deeper  despondency.  Sunk  in  an  abyss 
of  grief,  Rama  with  burning  sighs  and  deep  groans  addressed 
Lakshmana,  who  was  overwhelmed  with  anxiety,  in  words 
inspired  by  his  own  affliction,  saying : — 

"  There  is  none  in  the  world  I  deem  more  wretched  than  I ; 
misfortune  after  misfortune  follow  each  other  in  uninterrupted 
succession ;  it  is  breaking  my  heart.  Surely,  formerly  I 
either  designed  or  executed  innumerable  evil  acts  and  now 
their  fruit  has  matured  and  greater  and  greater  calamities 
beset  me !  The  loss  of  my  kingdom,  separation  from  my 
relatives,  the  parting  from  my  mother,  the  remembrance  of 
these  things  adds  to  the  sum  of  mine  unhappiness.  Yet 
those  griefs  were  forgotten  as  also  the  privations  of  mine 
exile  in  the  forest,  but  now  the  disappearance  of  Sita  re- 
131  k 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

awakens  their  memory  as  an  almost  extinct  brazier  suddenly 
bursts  into  flame. 

"  My  youthful  and  timid  spouse  has  been  carried  away 
through  the  sky  by  a  titan,  emitting  heart-rending  cries  un- 
ceasingly in  her  terror,  she  who  formerly  was  wont  to  converse 
so  sweetly.  Assuredly  the  breast  of  my  Beloved,  sprinkled 
with  saffron  of  great  price,  is  now  soiled  with  blood  and  dust, 
yet  I  still  live  !  Sita,  whose  speech  was  gentle,  clear  and  sweet, 
whose  beauty  was  enhanced  by  her  curly  locks,  has  grown  pale, 
having  fallen  a  prey  to  the  titans  and  she  has  lost  her  radiance, 
as  the  moon  in  the  mouth  of  Rahu.  The  neck  of  my  beloved 
and  faithful  consort,  decorated  with  a  string  of  pearls,  may 
even  now  have  been  severed  by  the  titans  in  some  deserted 
place,  where  they  are  drinking  her  blood.  Deprived  of  my 
presence,  surrounded  by  titans  in  the  forest  where  they  dwell 
and  borne  away  by  them,  the  unfortunate  large-eyed  Sita  will 
be  crying  out  pitifully  like  a  wounded  osprey. 

"  In  this  valley  Sita  of  gracious  mien,  sitting  beside  me, 
addressed  thee  with  gentle  words  and  sweet  smiles,  O  Laksh- 
mana.  Is  she  perchance  wandering  on  the  banks  of  this  most 
beautiful  of  rivers,  the  Godaveri,  so  loved  by  her,  but  no, 
she  was  never  wont  to  walk  alone !  She  whose  face  resembled 
the  lotus,  her  eyes  like  their  petals,  has  gone  to  gather  water 
lilies,  but  how  is  this  possible,  since  without  me  she  would 
never  gather  flowers  ? 

"  Has  she  entered  the  forest  full  of  blossoming  trees,  fre- 
quented by  flocks  of  birds  of  every  kind  ?  Alas,  no !  She  was 
too  timid  to  venture  forth  alone  and  would  have  died  of  fear  ! 
O  Sun,  witness  of  all  that  takes  place  on  earth  and  of  every 
act,  be  it  good  or  evil,  has  my  beloved  wandered  away  or  has 
she  been  abducted?  O  tell  me,  lest  I  die  of  grief!  O  Wind, 
nothing  in  the  world  is  unknown  to  thee ;  say,  has  Sita,  the 
flower  of  her  race,  lost  her  way  or  been  carried  off,  or  is 
she  dead  ?  " 

Thus  did  Rama  lament,  a  victim  to  grief  and  despair,  and 
the  valiant  Saumitri,  fixed  in  his  duty,  addressed  him  in  words 
fitting  to  the  occasion  saying : — 

"  O  Hero,  abandon  thy  grief  and  take  heart !  Look  on  the 
disappearance  of  thy  spouse  with  detachment  and  engage  with 
132 


ARANYA    KANDA 

vigour  in  thy  search  for  her.  Men  of  spirit  do  not  allow 
themselves  to  be  cast  down,  even  in  the  race  of  extreme 
adversity." 

Thus  did  the  highly  powerful  Lakshmana  speak,  despite 
his  distress,  but  Rama,  the  foremost  of  the  House  of  Raghu, 
paid  no  heed  to  his  words  and  once  again  gave  himself  up 
to  his  great  sorrow. 


CHAPTER     64 

Rama's  Wrath 

Stricken  with  grief,  Rama  addressed  Lakshmana  in  broken 
accents,  saying : — "  O  Lakshmana,  repair  with  all  haste  to  the  river 
Godaveri;  it  may  be  that  Sita  has  gone  thither  to  gather  lotuses." 

At  these  words,  Lakshmana  immediately  proceeded  to  the 
lovely  river  Godaveri  and  having  visited  the  sacred  fords, 
returning,  spoke  to  Rama,  saying : — 

"  I  have  searched  all  the  holy  places  but  I  have  not  seen  her 
anywhere  nor  does  she  answer  to  my  call.  Where  can  Vaidehi 
have  gone  ?  I  do  not  know  where  that  lady  of  slender  waist 
can  be,  O  Rama." 

Hearing  Lakshmana  speak  thus,  the  unfortunate  Rama,  dis- 
tracted with  anxiety,  ran  to  the  banks  of  the  Godaveri  river 
and  there  cried  out : — "  Where  is  Sita  ?  " 

But  neither  the  spirits  of  the  forest  nor  the  river  dared  to 
inform  Rama  that  she  had  been  borne  away  by  that  Indra  of 
Titans  who  merited  death. 

The  Godaveri,  recollecting  the  former  exploits  of  the  wicked 
Ravana,  was  restrained  by  fear  from  imparting  what  was 
known  to  her  of  Vaidehi's  fate.  The  river's  silence  caused 
Rama  to  abandon  all  hope  of  seeing  Sita  again  and  overcome 
with  despair  at  her  disappearance  he  said  to  Saumitri : — 

"  The  beloved  Godaveri  has  no  answer  for  me,  O  Lakshmana. 
What  shall  I  say  to  Janaka  or  Vaidehi's  mother  when,  returning 
without  her,  we  meet  once  more  ?  Seeing  me  without  Vaidehi, 
I  shall  become  an  object  of  odium  to  them. 

"  When,  dispossessed  of  my  kingdom}  I  was  forced  to  live 
in  the  forest  on  wild  fruits,  my  misery  was  assuaged  by  the 

i33 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Princess  of  Videha.  Where  is  she  now  ?  Far  from  my  kins- 
men, unable  to  find  Vaidehi,  how  shall  I  pass  the  long  nights  • 
without  sleep  ? 

"  I  have  searched  everywhere,  by  the  Mandakini,  in 
Janasthana  and  on  the  mountain  Prasravana  to  find  Sita.  O  Hero, 
observe  the  wild  deer,  full  of  energy,  who  regard  me  unceasingly 
and  by  their  glances  seem  to  wish  to  communicate  with  me." 

Beholding  them,  that  Lion  among  Men,  Raghava,  fixing  his 
gaze  on  them  cried : — "  Where  is  Sita  ?  "  in  a  voice  broken 
by  sobs.  Thus  addressed  by  that  Lord  of  Men,  the  deer  rose 
and  turned  their  heads  towards  the  south,  looking  upward, 
thus  indicating  the  path  by  which  Sita  had  been  borne  away. 

Thereafter  those  deer,  turning  southwards,  sometimes 
fixing  their  gaze  on  that  Chief  of  Men  and  then  looking  towards 
the  sky,  emitted  cries,  running  in  front  of  the  two  brothers, 
seeking  to  attract  their  attention,  and  Lakshmana,  understanding 
their  movements  and  their  cries,  said  to  his  elder  brother : — 

"  O  My  Lord,  since  thou  accosted  these  deer  saying : 
*  Where  is  Sita  ? '  they,  rising  up,  have  indicated  a  southerly 
direction,  let  us  therefore  follow  that  path ;  perchance  we 
shall  discover  some  trace  of  that  noble  lady  or  she  herself." 

"  Be  it  so  "  answered  Kakutstha,  directing  his  step  towards 
the  south,  followed  by  Lakshmana.  Thereafter  casting  his  gaze 
on  the  earth,  he  observed  some  flowers  scattered  on  the  ground 
and,  exceedingly  distressed,  said  to  his  brother  : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  I  remember  these  flowers,  for  I  gathered 
them  in  the  forest  and  gave  them  to  Vaidehi,  with  these  she 
decorated  her  hair.  Methinks  the  sun,  the  wind  and  the  earth 
have  preserved  them  for  my  pleasure." 

Thereafter  Rama  addressed  the  mountain  of  innumerable 
torrents,  saying : — 

"  O  Lord  of  the  Hills,  hast  thou  seen  that  princess  of  lovely 
limbs,  that  gracious  one  I  left  in  this  charming  grove  ?  " 

Thereupon,  in  tones  of  anguish  he  began  to  threaten  that 
mountain,  as  a  lion  roars  in  the  presence  of  a  deer,  and  cried 
out : — "  O  Mountain,  show  me  that  lady  whose  skin  resembles 
beaten  gold  or  I  will  shatter  thy  crests." 

Thus  questioned  by  Rama  concerning  Sita,  the  Princess  of 
Mithila,  the  mountain  would  fain  have  spoken  but  through 
»34 


ARANYA    KANDA 

fear  of  Ravana  it  remained  silent ;    whereupon   the  son  of 
Dasaratha  addressed  that  rocky  mass,  saying ; — 

"  My  fiery  arrows  shall  reduce  thee  to  ashes,  thou  shalt  be 
stripped  of  thy  verdure,  thy  trees,  and  thy  creepers,  and  none 
shall  inhabit  thee.  O  Lakshmana,  this  river  too  shall  be 
dried  up  by  me  if  it  does  not  reveal  where  Sita  may  be  found, 
whose  radiance  resembles  the  full  moon  in  her  course." 

In  his  wrath,  Rama  would  fain  have  consumed  the  mountain 
with  his  glance,  when  suddenly  he  beheld  the  imprint  of  the 
titan's  foot  on  the  ground  and  those  of  Vaidehi,  who  in  her 
terror  had  run  hither  and  thither  before  being  dragged  away 
by  him. 

Seeing  the  marks  of  Sita's  feet  and  those  of  the  titan, 
with  the  shattered  bow,  two  quivers  and  parts  of  the  chariot, 
Rama,  his  heart  beating  rapidly,  said  to  his  beloved  brother : — 

"  See,  O  Lakshmana,  the  scattered  fragments  of  Vaidehi's 
ornaments  and  the  many  garlands  and  the  drops  of  blood 
shining  like  molten  gold  covering  the  earth  on  every  side. 
It  is  certain,  O  Lakshmana,  that  the  titans  who  change  their 
form  at  will,  have  hewn  the  body  of  Sita  to  pieces,  which  they 
have  now  devoured.  On  account  of  Sita,  a  terrible  struggle 
has  taken  place  here,  O  Saumitri. 

"  This  great  bow,  encrusted  with  pearls,  marvellously  inlaid, 
which  is  broken  and  lying  on  the  earth,  to  whom  can  it  belong, 
O  Friend  ?  To  what  titan  or  to  what  God,  O  My  Child,  does 
this  golden  armour  belong,  bright  as  the  rising  sun,  enriched 
with  emeralds  and  pearls,  the  pieces  of  which  are  strewn  on 
the  earth  ?  Whose  canopy  is  lying  here,  possessing  a  hundred 
staves,  decorated  with  celestial  garlands,  its  supports  broken  ? 
And  whose  are  these  mules,  harnessed  with  gold,  having 
goblins'  heads,  terrible  to  behold,  that  have  been  slain  in  the 
fight?  This  chariot  of  war,  shining  like  a  flame,  which  is 
overturned  and  broken,  to  whom  does  it  belong?  These 
arrows  too,  a  hundred  fingers  in  length,  of  terrifying  aspect, 
their  golden  tips  blunted,  lying  in  a  hundred  fragments  and 
the  two  quivers  filled  with  excellent  shafts,  whose  are  they  ? 

"  See  the  charioteer  lying  on  the  earth,  the  lash  and  reins 
still  in  his  hands,  who  was  his  master  ?  Without  doubt  these 
footprints  are  those  of  a  mighty  titan,  O  Lakshmana.    Behold 
135 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

how  under  a  thousand  guises  the  bitter  hatred  of  these  titans, 
who  are  ruthless  and  able  to  change  their  form  at  will,  is  made 
manifest !  Alas,  the  blessed  Vaidehi  has  been  carried  hence 
or  she  is  dead  and  has  been  devoured  !  If  virtue  was  not  able 
to  protect  Vaidehi  from  being  carried  away  by  stealth  in  the 
great  forest  and  she  has  been  devoured,  O  Lakshmana,  how 
can  even  the  great  ones  of  this  world  offer  me  any  solace  ? 
The  supreme  Creator  of  the  Universe  Himself,  were  He  to 
manifest  compassion,  would  be  misunderstood  and  held  in 
contempt  by  the  world,  and  Z,  who  am  by  nature  gentle,  who 
have  subdued  my  senses  and  who  exercise  mercy,  desiring 
the  welfare  of  all,  shall  be  thought  wanting  in  valour  by  the 
Gods. 

"  O  Lakshmana,  my  virtues  shall  be  overshadowed  to-day, 
as  thou  shalt  soon  witness,  and  my  wrath  be  manifest  in  the 
destruction  of  the  demons  and  all  created  beings !  As  the 
rising  sun  obscures  the  splendour  of  the  moon,  so  will  my 
great  attributes  be  withdrawn  and  my  naked  splendour  blaze 
forth ;  there  will  be  no  escape  for  any  in  the  Three  Worlds, 
neither  Yaksha,  Gandharva,  Pisacha,  Rakshasa,  Kinnera, 
nor  man,  O  Lakshmana.  Soon  shalt  thou  see  mine  arrows 
filling  the  firmament,  the  planets  stayed  in  their  courses,  the 
moon  veiled,  fire  and  wind  restrained,  the  brightness  of  the 
sun  obscured,  the  crests  of  the  mountains  shattered,  the  lakes 
dried  up,  creepers  and  trees  uprooted  and  the  ocean  drained. 

"  If  the  Gods  do  not  bring  back  Sita  to  me,  I  shall  blot  out 
the  Three  Worlds !  Then,  O  Saumitri  they  will  be  forced  to 
acknowledge  my  prowess  !  None  shall  find  refuge  anywhere  in 
space,  O  Lakshmana  j  to-day  thou  shalt  see  the  universe  pass 
beyond  its  bournes.  With  the  help  of  the  arrows  loosed  from 
my  bow,  which  I  shall  stretch  up  to  mine  ear,  no  being  will 
be  able  to  survive ;  for  Sita's  sake  I  shall  rid  the  world  of 
goblins  and  demons  and  the  Gods  shall  witness  the  power  of 
these  missiles,  loosed  in  my  wrath. 

"  The  worlds  of  the  Gods,  Giants,  Yakshas  and  Titans  will 
be  annihilated  under  the  impact  of  my  shafts.  With  mine 
arrows  I  shall  shatter  the  defences  of  the  Three  Worlds,  if 
the  Gods  do  not  restore  Vaidehi  to  me  as  she  was  before  she 
was  borne  away.  If  they  do  not  bring  back  my  beloved  un- 
136 


ARANYA    KANDA 

harmed,  I  shall  lay  waste  the  entire  universe  and  ail  contained 
therein.  Until  I  find  myself  in  Sita's  presence  once  more, 
I  shall  let  loose  every  weapon  of  destruction." 

Having  spoken  thus,  Rama,  his  eyes  flashing  with  anger,  his 
lips  compressed  and  trembling,  tied  fast  his  robe  of  bark  and 
deerskin  and  knotted  his  hair,  whereupon  that  sagacious  One 
resembled  Rudra  bent  upon  the  destruction  of  Tripura. 

Taking  his  bow  from  Lakshmana's  hands,  he  drew  it  with 
might,  selecting  a  terrible  steel-pointed  shaft  resembling  a 
venomous  serpent,  and  the  effulgent  Rama,  filled  with  wrath, 
the  Scourge  of  his  Foes,  resembling  the  Fire  at  the  destruction 
of  the  world,  said  : — 

"  As  beings  cannot  escape  old  age,  destiny  or  death,  so  is 
none  able  to  restrain  my  wrath !  O  Lakshmana,  if  I  do  not 
recover  Sita  this  day  in  all  her  pristine  beauty,  I  shall  destroy 
the  universe  with  its  Gods,  Gandharvas,  human  beings, 
Punnagas  and  mountains." 


CHAPTER     65 

Lakshmana  seeks  to  pacify  Rama 

A  prey  to  grief  on  account  of  Sita's  abduction,  Rama,  resembling 
the  Fire  of  Dissolution,  sought  to  bring  about  the  destruction 
of  the  Worlds. 

With  burning  sighs  he  contemplated  the  stringed  bow,  as 
Hara  at  the  end  of  the  world-cycle  stands  ready  to  consume 
the  universe. 

Seeing  Rama  transported  with  rage,  hitherto  never  manifested 
by  him,  Lakshmana,  his  features  pale  with  terror,  addressed  him 
with  joined  palms,  saying  : — 

"  Formerly  thou  wert  ever  gentle,  of  controlled  mind  and 
devoted  to  the  welfare  of  all  beings,  do  not  now  give  way  to 
wrath  and  renounce  thy  true  nature.  As  the  radiance  of  the 
moon,  the  brilliance  of  the  sun,  the  velocity  of  the  wind  and 
the  forbearance  of  the  earth,  so  is  thy  glory  manifested  without 
equal  and  without  end.  Wherefore  dost  thou  seek  to  destroy 
the  worlds  on  account  of  one  man's  sin  ? 
137 


THE  RAMAYANA  OF  VALMIKI 
"  It  is  not  yet  known  to  whom  this  shattered  chariot  belongs 
nor  because  of  whom  nor  between  whom,  the  struggle,  of 
which  we  see  the  traces,  took  place.  This  spot  bears  the  marks 
of  wheels  and  feet  and  is  sprinkled  with  drops  of  blood ;  it  is 
the  scene  of  a  desperate  struggle,  O  Son  of  a  King,  but  it  is 
a  fight  between  single  combatants,  O  Most  Eloquent  of  Men  ! 
I  see  no  trace  of  a  great  army  and  it  is  not  fitting  that  thou 
shouldst  destroy  the  worlds  on  account  of  one  man. 

"  Kings  should  always  rule  with  justice,  gentleness  and 
moderation.  Thou  wast  ever  the  refuge  of  all  beings  and 
their  supreme  asylum.  Who  would  condone  the  bearing 
away  of  thy  consort,  O  Raghava  ?  Rivers,  seas,  mountains, 
Gods,  Gandharvas  and  Danavas  have  no  desire  to  displease 
thee,  even  as  the  officiating  priest  will  not  harm  the  one  under- 
taking a  sacrifice  after  he  has  performed  the  preparatory  rites. 
"  O  Prince,  it  is  for  thee  to  seek  out  Site's  abductor,  followed 
by  the  great  sages  and  by  me  with  my  bow.  We  will  search  the 
ocean,  the  hills,  the  forests,  the  deep_  caves  and  innumerable 
lakes  filled  with  lotuses.  We  will  enquire  of  the  Gods  and 
Gandharvas  in  every  region,  until  we  find  the  captor  of 
thy  consort.  If  the  Chiefs  of  the  Gods  do  not  restore  thy 
wife  peaceably,  then,  O  King  of  Koshala,  adopt  those  measures 
that  thou  considerest  fitting.  If,  through  gentleness,  humility 
and  prudence,  thou  dost  not  regain  thy  spouse,  O  Indra  among 
Men,  then  let  loose  thine  innumerable  golden-tipped  arrows, 
resembling  Mahendra's  thunderbolts." 


CHAPTER    66 

Lakskmana  seeks  to  inspire  Rama  with  Courage 

Overcome  by  grief  and  wailing  like  one  orphaned,  Rama, 
sick  at  heart,  was  plunged  in  misery,  whereupon  Lakshmana, 
the  son  of  Sumitra,  taking  hold  of  his  feet  and  pressing  them, 
sought  to  console  and  comfort  him,  saying : — 

"  By  great  austerity  and  innumerable  pious  acts  did  the 
King  Dasaratha  obtain  thee,  as  the  Celestials  acquired  the 
138 


ARANYA    KANDA 

Nectar  of  Immortality.  Bound  to  thee  by  thy  virtues,  that 
great  monarch  on  thy  departure  returned  to  the  heavenly 
region,  thus  have  we  heard  from  Bharata.  If  thou  art  not 
able  to  endure  the  calamity  that  has  overtaken  thee,  then  how 
should  an  ordinary  man  do  so  ? 

"  O  Chief  of  Men,  take  courage  !  What  living  being  is  not 
subject  to  adversity,  which  approaches  like  a  flame  and  instantly 
passes  away?  Even  so  is  the  world.  Did  not  Yayati,  the 
son  of  Nahusha,  fall  from  heaven  overcome  by  ill  fortune  ? 
In  a  single  day  the  great  Sage  Vasishtha,  the  chief  priest  of 
our  sire,  was  bereft  of  four  hundred  sons  born  to  him ;  and 
the  Mother  of  the  World,  the  Earth  herself,  revered  by  all,  is 
sometimes  known  to  tremble,  O  Master  of  Koshala  I  The 
sun  and  moon,  the  eyes  of  the  world,  the  very  symbols  of 
virtue  by  whom  all  things  are  ordered,  suffer  eclipse.  Those 
great  beings,  the  Gods  themselves,  are  subject  to  fate,  O  Lion 
among  Men  ;  how  much  more  man  ?  It  is  said  that  even  Indra 
and  the  Gods  endure  vicissitudes ;  it  doth  not  behove  thee, 
therefore,  to  lament. 

*'  Even  should  Vaidehi  be  dead  or  carried  away,  O  Raghava, 
it  is  not  worthy  of  thee  to  yield  to  despair  like  a  common  man. 
Thine  equals  are  never  moved  even  in  the  greatest  perils  but 
look  on  all  with  equanimity,  O  Kakutstha ! 

"  O  Thou  Best  of  Men,  after  due  consideration,  discriminate 
between  that  which  is  good  and  that  which  is  evil ;  persons  of 
right  wisdom  are  ever  cognizant  of  what  is  right  or  wrong. 
Owing  to  the  element  of  uncertainty,  one  cannot  at  once 
distinguish  the  advantage  or  disadvantage  of  a  deed,  but  if  one 
fails  to  act  the  desired  result  will  not  take  place.  Thus  hast 
thou  often  instructed  me,  O  Hero,  and  who  is  able  to  teach  thee 
anything?  Not  even  Brihaspati  himself.  Even  the  Gods  are 
powerless  to  fix  the  limit  of  thy  wisdom,  O  Thou  of  Mighty 
Intellect. 

"  I  would  fain  arouse  the  power  that  sorrow  has  quenched 
in  *thee !  Having  reflected  on  the  strength  of  the  Gods,  of 
men  and  of  thyself,  O  Lion  of  the  Ikshwakus,  prepare  to 
overcome  thine  enemies  !  Of  what  use  were  it  for  thee  to 
destroy  the  world,  O  Thou  Best  of  Men  ?  Seek  out  thy  per- 
fidious adversary  and  put  an  end  to  his  life !  " 
139 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER     67 

Rama  encounters  Jatayu 

At  these  apposite  words,  full  of  wisdom,  uttered  by  his  younger 
brother  Lakshmana,  Raghava,  regaining  possession  of  himself, 
rallied  his  courage  anew.  Controlling  his  wrath,  the  long- 
armed  Rama,  leaning  on  his  marvellous  bow,  said  to 
Lakshmana  : — "  O  My  Friend,  what  should  be  done  ?  Whither 
shall  we  go,  O  Lakshmana  ?  How  shall  we  find  Sita  again  ? 
Let  us  consider  these  things  carefully." 

To  these  anxious  enquiries,  Lakshmana  answered  : — "  It  is 
for  thee  to  search  Janasthana  which  is  inhabited  by  innumerable 
titans  and  covered  with  trees  and  .creepers  of  every  kind. 
There,  inaccessible  cliffs,  chasms  and  caves  are  to  be  found 
and  dark  caverns  inhabited  by  herds  of  wild  beasts,  the  retreat 
of  Kinneras  and  the  resort  of  Gandharvas ;  with  me  explore 
these  places.  As  the  mountains  are  not  affected  by  tempest, 
neither  can  adversity  daunt  the  wise  such  as  thou,  O  Lion 
among  Men." 

Thus  speaking,  Lakshmana  began  to  scour  the  forest,  and 
Rama,  still  chafing  under  adversity,  advanced  holding  his  bow 
on  which  was  strung  a  formidable  steel-pointed  shaft,  when 
suddenly  he  beheld  Jatayu,  that  excellent  King  of  Birds, 
resembling  a  mountain  peak,  lying  on  the  earth  covered  with 
blood.  Seeing  that  great  vulture,  like  unto  the  crest  of  a 
mountain,  Rama  said  to  Lakshmana  : — 

"  Without  doubt,  here  is  the  titan,  who,  ranging  the  forest 
under  the  guise  of  a  vulture,  has  destroyed  Sita,  the  Princess 
of  Videha  !  Having  satisfied  himself  by  devouring  that  large- 
eyed  princess,  he  is  resting  at  ease ;  I  shall  pierce  him  with  my 
dread  and  fiery  shafts  that  fly  straight  to  their  target." 

Speaking  thus,  Rama,  fixing  a  sharp  arrow  on  his  bow,  ran 
towards  him  and  in  his  ire  it  seemed  he  would  destroy  the 
earth,  whose  boundaries  are  the  sea. 
140 


ARANYA    KANDA 

Vomiting  blood,  that  bird  then  addressed  Rama  the  son  of 
Dasaratha,  in  the  mournful  accents  of  one  about  to  die, 
saying: — 

"  O  Thou  of  long  life,  that  divinity  whom  thou  seefcest  in 
the  great  forest,  as  one  does  a  healing  herb,1  has  been  borne 
away  by  Havana,  as  has  my  life  also. 

"  O  Raghava,  in  the  absence  of  Lakshmana  and  thyself, 
that  princess  was  seen  by  me,  being  dragged  away  by  the  all- 
powerful  Ravana.  Flying  to  the  aid  of  Sita,  O  Lord,  Ravana 
was  thrown  to  the  earth  by  me  in  the  struggle  that  ensued, 
and  his  chariot  and  canopy  shattered.  With  a  stroke  of  my 
wing,  I  slew  the  charioteer,  but  being  at  the  end  of  my  strength, 
my  two  wings  were  severed  by  Ravana's  sword,  and  he,  seizing 
hold  of  Sita,  the  Princess  of  Videha,  escaped  into  the  air. 
That  titan  has  left  me  here  to  die ;  do  not  slay  me,  O  Prince." 

Receiving  these  precious  tidings  concerning  Sita,  Rama, 
dropping  his  great  bow,  embraced  the  King  of  the  Vultures, 
and  then,  despite  his  resolve,  fell  to  the  ground  overcome  with 
grief  and  began  to  lament  with  Lakshmana.  Seeing  Jatayu 
alone  in  that  perilous  and  isolated  pathway,  moaning  un- 
ceasingly, Rama,  overwhelmed  with  pity,  said  to  Saumitri : — 
"  The  loss  of  my  kingdom,  exile  to  the  forest,  the  abduction 
of  Sita  and  the  death  of  this  Twice-born,  renders  my  fate  such 
that  it  would  consume  fire  itself.  Even  were  the  sea  filled 
to  the  brim  and  I  to  enter  it  this  day,  that  Lord  of  the  Rivers 
would  dry  up  on  account  of  my  misfortunes. 

"  Such  is  the  adversity  that  encompasses  me  that  there  is 
none  in  all  the  worlds  amongst  animate  and  inanimate  beings 
who  is  so  wretched  as  I !  On  account  of  mine  evil  karma,  this 
childhood  friend  of  my  sire,  the  mighty  King  of  the  Vultures, 
lies  dying  on  the  earth !  " 

Repeating  these  words  again  and  again  to  Lakshmana  who 
accompanied  him,  Rama  began  to  caress  Jatayu,  passing  his 
hand  lovingly  over  the  body  of  his  father's  friend.  Thereafter 
taking  the  King  of  the  Vultures,  whose  wings  were  severed 
and  who  was  bathed  in  blood,  in  his  arms,  he  said  :— 

"  Where  has  Maithili  gone,  who  is  dearer  to  me  than  life  ?  " 
and  having  spoken  thus,  Raghava  sank  down  on  the  earth.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER    68 

Jatayu's  Death 

In  the  presence  of  the  vulture,  whom  the  terrible  Ravana  had 
struck  down,  Rama,  full  of  compassion  for  all,  addressed  the 
son  of  Saumitri  in  these  words : — 

"  This  bird,  who  sought  to  defend  my  interests,  has  been 
mortally  wounded  in  the  struggle  with  the  titan  and  for  my 
sake  now  lies  dying  here.  Its  vital  breaths  are  barely  per- 
ceptible, O  Lakshmana,  its  eyes  are  dim  and  it  is  unable  to  speak. 

"  O  Jatayu,  if  it  be  possible  for  thee,  then  say  what  has 
become  of  Sita  and  how  thou  hast  come  to  this  sorry  pass. 
For  what  reason  has  Ravana  carried  away  my  dear  one  ?  How 
did  that  radiant  and  enchanting  face,  resembling  the  moon, 
appear  at  that  time,  O  Best  of  the  Twice-born.  What  words 
did  Sita  utter  at  that  moment?  What  is  the  strength,  the 
appearance  and  the  karma  of  that  titan  ?  Where  does  he 
dwell,  O  Friend,  answer  me !  " 

Beholding  Rama  lamenting  like  an  orphan,  the  virtuous 
Jatayu  answered  in  feeble  accents : — 

"  Sita  has  been  carried  away  by  that  Indra  of  Titans, 
Ravana,  that  evil  wretch  who  resorts  to  the  aid  of  sorcery  and 
is  able  to  loose  the  wind  and  the  tempest.  O  Dear  Child,  I 
being  exhausted,  that  Prowler  of  the  Night  severed  my  two 
wings  and,  thereafter  taking  hold  of  Sita,  fled  in  a  southerly 
direction.  My  breathing  is  laboured  and  my  sight  dim,  O 
Raghava,  I  see  before  me  the  golden  trees  with  leaves  formed 
of  Ushira.1  The  hour  in  which  Ravana  bore  Sita  away  was 
that  in  which  the  loser  soon  recovers  that  which  is  lost, 
1  Vindya '  is  its  name,  O  Kakutstha,  and  Ravana  was  unaware 
of  it.  Like  a  fish  that  swallows  the  bait,  he  will  soon  perish  ! 
Do  not,  therefore,  despair  of  recovering  Janaki;  thou  wilt 
soon  sport  with  her,  having  slain  Ravana  in  battle  1  " 

While  the  vulture  was  thus  replying  to  Rama,  blood  and 
morsels  of  flesh  flowed  from  his  beak  and,  on  the  verge  of 
death,  retaining  his  consciousness,  Jatayu  added  : — "  Ravana  is 

1  TJshira — A  hair-like  grass  said  to  grow  on  the  trees  in  hell. 

142

the  son  of  Vishravas  and  the  brother  of  Vishravana ! "  and 
thereafter  yielded  up  his  life. 

"  Speak !  Speak  further !  "  cried  Rama,  addressing  him 
with  joined  palms,  but  the  life-breaths,  withdrawn  from  that 
vulture's  body,  were  already  dissipated.  Thereupon  the  King 
of  the  Vultures  fell  on  the  earth,  his  legs,  body  and  head 
stretched  out  and,  beholding  that  bird  resembling  a  mountain 
of  vast  proportions,  that  bird  of  reddened  eyes,  deprived  of  life, 
Rama,  staggering  under  the  weight  of  his  misfortune,  said  to 
Saumitri  in  bitter  tones  : — 

"  Passing  many  years  happily  in  the  forest,  the  resort  of 
titans,  this  bird  has  at  length  given  up  his  life !  Having  lived 
innumerable  years,  he  now  lies  here  inanimate !  None  can 
withstand  the  course  of  destiny !  Behold,  O  Lakshmana,  this 
vulture  who  died  in  my  service  having  sought  to  protect  Sita,  and 
who  has  been  slain  by  Ravana  of  superior  power.  He  renounced 
the  dominion  bequeathed  to  him  by  his  ancestors  and  sacrificed 
his  life  for  my  sake.  Undoubtedly  the  virtuous  practise 
courage,  devotion  and  the  fulfilment  of  duty,  even  in  the 
animal  kingdom,  O  Saumitri !  I  did  not  feel  so  keen  a  grief 
for  Sita's  abduction  as  for  the  death  of  this  vulture,  who  has 
sacrificed  himself  for  me,  O  Scourger  of  Thy  Foes  ! 

"  I  hold  this  King  of  Birds  in  the  same  veneration  as  I  did 
the  illustrious  and  fortunate  monarch,  Dasaratha,  O  Saumitri ! 
Do  thou  bring  fuel  that  I  may  ignite  the  pyre  of  that  King  of 
Vultures,  who  died  for  me.  Placing  the  body  of  that  protector 
of  the  realm  of  winged  creatures  on  the  funeral  pile,  who 
has  been  destroyed  by  the  cruel  titan,  I  shall  cremate  it. 
O  King  of  the  Vultures,  O  Magnanimous  Being,  cremated 
and  blessed  by  me,  depart,  and  ascend  to  those  regions, 
further  than  which  it  is  not  possible  to  go  and  which  are  the 
abode  of  those  who  habitually  offer  sacrifice,  those  heroes 
who  never  retreat  on  the  batde  field  and  those  who  distribute 
land  in  charity." 

With  these  words,  the  virtuous  Rama  placed  the  King  of 
Winged  Creatures  on  the  funeral  pyre  and,  full  of  grief,  ignited 
the  flame  as  if  performing  the  rite  for  his  own  kinsman. 

Thereafter,  the  illustrious  Rama,  accompanied  by  Saumitri, 
entered  the  forest  and,  killing  a  few  fet  Rohi  deer,  strewed  the 
143 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

flesh  on  the  green  grass  as  an  oblation  to  that  bird.  Tearing 
off  the  flesh  of  those  deer  and  kneading  it  into  balls,  he  offered 
it  to  the  vulture  in  that  pleasant  forest  land,  placing  it  on  fresh 
grass.  Thereafter,  in  order  that  Jatayu  might  soon  reach  the 
celestial  abode,  he  recited  those  sacred  formulas  uttered  by  the 
brahmins,  after  which  the  two  princes  repaired  to  the  Godaveri 
river  to  offer  water  in  honour  of  the  kingly  bird.  Following 
the  traditional  rites,  those  two  Descendants  of  Raghu  bathed 
and  performed  the  Udaka1  ceremony  for  the  King  of  the 
Vultures,  who,  having  fallen  on  the  held  of  battle,  had  executed 
a  glorious  and  difficult  deed  and  now,  blessed  by  Rama,  had 
attained  to  the  place  prepared  for  him  in  the  realm  of  the 
saints. 

Thereupon  those  two  princes,  after  offering  the  last  rites 
in  honour  of  that  excellent  bird,  as  if  to  their  sire,  entered 
the  forest,  their  minds  set  on  the  recovery  of  Sita,  like  Vishnu 
and  Vasava,  the  Sovereigns  of  the  Gods. 


CHAPTER    69 

Rama  and  Lakskmana  meet  Ayomukki  and  Kabandha 

Having  performed  the  purificatory  rites  in  honour  of  Jatayu, 
the  two  princes  entered  the  forest  in  quest  of  Sita,  proceeding 
in  a  south-westerly  direction.  Armed  with  sword,  bow  and 
arrow,  those  offshoots  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku  followed  a 
hitherto  untrodden  path,  overgrown  with  bushes,  trees  and 
creepers  of  various  kinds,  which  was  difficult  of  access,  with 
dense  thickets  on  either  side  and  of  sinister  appearance;  never- 
theless the  two  mighty  warriors  pressed  on  through  that  vast 
and  dangerous  wood. 

Having  traversed  Janasthana  and  covered  a  further  three 
leagues,  those  brothers,  endowed  with  great  energy,  penetrated 
into  the  thick  woodlands  of  the  Krauncha  Forest,  which 
resembled  a  group  of  clouds  and  presented  a  smiling  aspect 

1  Udaka  Ceremony — ritual  presentation  of  water  to  the  ancestors. 
144 


ARANYA    KANDA 

with  its  many  brilliant  flowers  and  the  herds  of  wild  deer  and 
flocks  of  birds  that  inhabited  it. 

After  exploring  this  forest,  anxious  to  behold  the  Princess  of 
Videha  once  more,  sometimes  halting  to  bewail  her  disappear- 
ance, the  two  brothers  resumed  their  journey,  and  covering  a 
distance  of  three  leagues  came   to  the  hermitage  of  Matanga. 

Having  searched  the  whole  forest  filled  with  fearful  beasts 
and  birds  and  planted  with  innumerable  trees  and  dense 
thickets,  the  two  sons  of  Dasaratha  beheld  a  cave  in  the  moun- 
tain, deep  as  the  region  under  the  earth  where  eternal  darkness 
reigns. 

Then  those  two  Lions  among  Men,  approaching  that  cave, 
perceived  the  vast  shape  of  a  female  titan  of  hideous  appear- 
ance. Fearful  of  aspect,  she  was  an  object  of  terror  to  weaker 
creatures  with  her  loathsome  countenance,  vast  stomach,  sharp 
teeth,  immense  stature  and  harsh  voice. 

This  monster  subsisted  on  the  flesh  of  ferocious  beasts  and 
now  appeared  before  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  her  hair  dis- 
hevelled, and  addressed  them,  saying : — 

"  Come  let  us  pass  the  time  in  dalliance  together."  There- 
after she  laid  hold  of  Lakshmana,  who  had  preceded  his  brother 
and  added: — 

"  I  am  named  Ayomukhi,  I  am  thine ;  do  thou  become  my 
lord,  O  Hero !  Let  us  give  ourselves  up  to  a  long  life  of 
pleasure  on  the  summits  of  the  mountains  and  among  the 
islands  in  the  rivers." 

Hearing  these  words,  the  Slayer  of  his  Foes,  Lakshmana, 
full  of  wrath,  drew  his  sword  and  cut  off  her  ears,  nose  and 
breasts.  Her  ears  and  nose  being  severed,  that  terrible  titan 
ran  away  with  all  speed,  and  when  she  had  disappeared,  the 
two  brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  Scourgers  of  their  Foes, 
hastily  pressed  on  and  entered  the  dense  forest. 

Thereafter  the  mighty  Lakshmana,  full  of  loyalty,  charm 
and  nobility,  addressed  bis  resplendent  brother  with  joined 
palms,  saying: — 

"  I  am  conscious  of  a  violent  throbbing  in  my  left  arm  and 

my  mind  is  filled  with  apprehension,  whilst  on  every  side  I 

perceive  inauspicious  omens ;   do  thou  therefore  hold  thyself 

in  readiness,  O  Great  One,  and  follow  my  counsel;   these 

145 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

different  portents  foretell  imminent  danger.  The  Vanchulaka  bird 
is  emitting  fearful  cries  which  indicate  a  speedy  victory  for  us." 

Thereupon  the  two  brothers  courageously  began  to  explore 
the  entire  forest,  when  a  terrible  clamour  arose  appearing  to 
rend  the  trees  ;  such  was  the  uproar  that  it  seemed  as  though 
a  mighty  wind  had  suddenly  swept  through  the  forest. 

Seeking  to  ascertain  the  cause  of  this  disturbance,  Rama, 
armed  with  a  sword,  bow  in  hand,  advancing  with  his  younger 
brother,  beheld  a  titan  of  vast  proportions,  possessing  huge 
thighs,  standing  before  him.  Headless,  his  mouth  in  his  belly, 
covered  with  brisding  hairs,  in  stature  equal  to  a  mountain, 
his  complexion  that  of  a  dark  cloud,  terrible  to  look  upon,  his 
voice  resounded  like  thunder. 

Shining  like  a  lit  torch,  he  seemed  to  emit  sparks  ;  his  single 
eye,  furnished  with  yellow  lids  opening  in  his  breast,  was 
strange  and  hideous  and  this  monster,  possessed  of  enormous 
teeth,  was  licking  his  lips.  Despite  their  ferocity  and  size, 
he  fed  on  bears,  lions,  deer  and  birds,  catching  them  with  his 
great  arms  at  a  distance  of  four  miles.  With  his  hands  he 
seized  hold  of  flocks  of  birds  and  herds  of  deer,  which  he  put 
into  his  mouth. 

Having  observed  them  a  mile  off,  he  obstructed  the  progress 
of  the  two  brothers  and  stood  awaiting  them.  That  colossal, 
hideous  and  dreadful  creature  of  sinister  aspect,  with  his 
trunk  and  vast  arras,  fearful  to  behold,  stretching  out,  seized 
the  two  valiant  brothers  and  gripped  them  with  all  his  strength. 

On  account  of  his  coolness  and  courage,  the  valiant  Raghava 
remained  unmoved,  but  Lakshmana,  being  a  mere  stripling  and 
volatile  by  nature,  began  to  tremble,  and  that  younger  brother 
of  Raghava  said  to  him  : — 

"  O  Hero,  behold  how  I  have  fallen  into  the  power  of  this 
titan ;  do  thou  leave  me  as  an  offering  to  the  evil  forces  and 
go  thy  way  happily ;  thou  wilt  soon  be  re-united  with  Vaidehi, 
this  is  my  firm  conviction !  O  Kakutstha,  when  thou  hast 
regained  the  kingdom  of  thy  forbears  and  art  installed  on  the 
throne,  remember  me  !  " 

At  these  words,  uttered  by  Lakshmana,  the  son  of  Sumitra, 
Rama  answered : — "  Have  no  fear,  O  Valiant  One,  persons  of 
thy  valour  are  never  perturbed." 
146 


ARANYA    KANDA 

Meanwhile  the  headless  titan,  of  huge  arms,  the  foremost 
among  the  giants,  said  to  them : — 

"  Who  are  you,  whose  shoulders  resemble  a  bull's,  armed 
with  great  swords  and  bows  ?  It  is  fortunate  indeed  for  me  that 
by  chance  you  have  come  within  my  range  in  this  dangerous 
place.  Say  for  what  reason  you  have  come  here,  where  I  wait 
ravaged  by  hunger,  ye  who  are  armed  with  arrows,  bows  and 
swords  and  resemble  bulls  with  pointed  horns?  Having 
approached  me,  your  death  is  imminent." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  wicked  Kabandha,  Rama,  his  face 
growing  pale,  said  to  Lakshmana : — 

"We  have  fallen  from  one  danger  into  a  greater  one,  O 
Hero ;  this  ill  chance  may  cost  us  our  lives  without  our  being 
able  to  rejoin  our  beloved  Sita.  The  power  of  destiny  over 
all  beings  is  inexorable,  O  Lakshmana  !  See,  O  Lion  among 
Men,  how  ill-fortune  drives  us  to  the  last  extremity ;  there  is 
nothing  that  weighs  so  heavily  on  man  as  destiny.  Even  the 
brave,  the  mighty,  the  great  and  skilful  warriors  on  the  field 
of  battle,  overtaken  by  destiny,  are  swept  away  like  banks 
of  sand." 

Thus  spoke  that  heroic  and  illustrious  son  of  Dasaratha,  filled 
with  distress,  his  eyes  fixed  on  Saumitri,  while  in  his  soul  his 
composure  was  fully  established. 


CHAPTER    70 

Rama  and  Lakshmana  sever  the  Arms  of  Kabandha 

Seeing  the  two  brothers  fallen  into  bis  arms  as  if  into  a  snare, 
Kabandha  said  to  them : — 

"  What  ails  you,  O  Foremost  among  Warriors  ?  Since  I  am 
tormented  with  hunger,  fate  has  destined  you  for  my  food  and 
for  this  reason  has  deprived  you  of  your  wits." 

Hearing  these  words  Lakshmana,  though  sore  distressed, 
determined  to  display  his  valour  and  addressed  Rama  in  words 
worthy  of  the  occasion,  saying : — 

M7  l 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  We  shall  soon  become  the  food  of  this  vile  demon,  who 
with  his  vast  and  powerful  arms  subdues  all  beings ;  let  us 
with  our  swords  sever  his  arms  with  all  speed,  O  Lord,  or  he 
will  make  an  end  of  us.  It  is  shameful  for  warriors  to  make 
away  with  those  who  cannot  defend  themselves  like  an  animal 
deprived  of  its  freedom  that  is  led  to  sacrifice." 

These  words  infuriated  the  demon,  who  opened  his  terrible 
mouth  wide,  preparing  to  devour  them,  whereupon  the  two 
brothers,  choosing  a  favourable  moment,  as  if  in  sport  cut  off 
bis  two  arms  at  the  shoulders,  Rama  cutting  the  right  and 
Lakshmana  with  a  vigorous  stroke  of  his  sword,  the  left.  There- 
upon Kabandha,  his  vast  arms  severed,  emitting  loud  shrieks 
which  resounded  through  the  earth  and  sky  like  thunder,  fell 
upon  the  ground.  Beholding  his  two  arms  severed  and  the 
blood  flowing  in  streams,  the  unfortunate  demon  enquired  of 
those  two  warriors  in  feeble  accents  : — "  Who  are  you  ?  " 

Thus  accosted,  the  supremely  courageous  Lakshmana  began 
to  extol  the  virtues  of  Kakutstha,  saying  : — 

"  This  is  Rama,  the  descendant  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku, 
known  throughout  the  earth,  and  I  am  his  younger  brother, 
Lakshmana.  Deprived  of  his  kingdom  by  the  Queen  Kaikeyi, 
Raghava  was  exiled  to  the  great  forest,  where  he  lived  with  his 
consort  and  myself.  While  this  hero,  mighty  as  a  God,  dwelt 
in  that  pastoral  retreat,  a  titan  bore  away  his  consort,  in  search 
of  whom  we  have  come  hither. 

"  And  thou,  who  art  thou,  wandering  in  these  woods  emitting 
flames,  thy  thighs  sunk  into  thy  body  ?  " 

On  hearing  Lakshmana,  Kabandha,  calling  Indra's  words  to 
mind,  answered  joyfully : — 

"  Welcome  to  you,  O  Tigers  among  Men,  beholding  you 
is  my  salvation ;  for  my  good,  you  have  cut  off  my  arms.  Do 
you  hear,  how,  due  to  mine  arrogance,  I  came  to  assume  this 
monstrous  shape.  O  Illustrious  Ones,  I  snail  relate  all  to  you 
truthfully."

ARANYA    KANDA 


CHAPTER    71 

Kabandha  tells  his  Story 

"  O  Long-armed  Rama,  formerly  I  was  filled  with  unimaginable 
energy  and  courage ;  my  beauty  was  famed  throughout  the 
Three  Worlds  and  equal  to  the  sun,  the  moon  and  Indra 
himself.  Assuming  a  terrible  form,  I  became  an  object  of 
fear  to  all  and  struck  terror  into  the  hearts  of  the  ascetics  living 
in  the  forest. 

"  O  Rama,  on  a  certain  occasion  I  incurred  the  wrath  of  a 
great  Rishi  named  Sthulashira,  whom  I  tormented  in  this 
loathsome  shape,  whilst  he  was  gathering  wild  fruits.  Fixing 
his  gaze  on  me,  he  pronounced  a  terrible  curse,  saying : — 
*  Do  thou  retain  for  ever  this  fearful  form,  assumed  by  thee 
in  order  to  harm  others  !  * 

"  Appealing  to  that  provoked  ascetic  to  rescind  his  curse, 
he  took  compassion  on  me  and  said :  '  When  Rama  cremates 
thee  in  the  lonely  forest,  having  severed  both  thine  arms, 
thou  shalt  regain  thy  great  and  wonderful  form.' 

"  O  Lakshmana,  know  that  I  am  really  the  son  of  Danu, 
who  was  extremely  handsome  to  look  upon ;  my  present 
appearance  is  due  to  a  curse  pronounced  by  Indra  on  the 
field  of  battle. 

"  By  rigorous  penances  I  gained  the  goodwill  of  Brahma, 
and  he  granted  me  the  boon  of  longevity.  Thereafter  I  was 
filled  with  pride  and,  thinking  '  What  can  Indra  do  to  me 
now ',  I  challenged  him  to  combat,  whereupon  he  hurled  his 
mace  of  a  hundred  edges  at  me.  By  the  force  of  this  weapon, 
my  thighs  and  head  were  thrust  into  my  body ;  I  prayed  to 
him  to  end  my  life,  but  he,  saying :  '  May  the  words  of  Brahma 
prove  true ',  compelled  me  to  go  on  living.  Then  I  addressed 
Mahendra,  saying: — 'How  shall  I  live  without  food,  since 
thou  hast  thrust  my  head  and  thighs  into  my  body  ?  * 
149 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Thereat,  Indra  caused  my  arms  to  extend  over  four  miles 
and  placed  a  mouth  with  sharp  teeth  in  my  belly.  Ever 
since,  stretching  out  my  arms,  I  wander  in  the  forest  and 
seize  hold  of  lions,  tigers  and  deer  and  put  them  into  my 
mouth.  Then  Indra  said  to  me  :  *  When  Rama  and  Lakshmana 
cut  off  thine  arms,  thou  shalt  attain  heaven  \ 

"  Since  then,  O  Great  One,  I  have  laid  hold  on  every  living 
being  I  have  found  in  the  forest  and  have  been  awaiting  Rama 
to  sever  my  arms ;  anticipating  this,  I  have  waited  for  death. 
Now,  O  Lord,  thou  hast  come,  be  thou  blessed !  None  but 
thou  can  put  an  end  to  my  life ;  the  words  of  the  great  Rishi 
have  proved  true,  O  Illustrious  One.  I  will  put  my  counsel 
at  thy  service,  O  Bull  among  Men,  and,  when  I  have  received 
the  consecration  of  fire,  will  form  a  pact  of  friendship  with 
you  both." 

At  these  words  of  Danu,  Rama,  in  the  hearing  of  Lakshmana, 
answered  him,  saying  : — 

"  Ravana  has  borne  away  mine  illustrious  consort,  Sita, 
whilst  I  and  my  brother  were  absent  from  the  hermitage.  I 
am  conversant  only  with  the  name  of  that  titan  but  not  with 
his  form,  nor  are  we  acquainted  with  his  strength,  nor  where 
he  dwells.  Helpless  and  distressed,  we  wander  here  and  there 
in  the  forest ;  it  behoveth  thee  to  show  thy  compassion  to  us. 
After  gathering  all  the  branches  that  are  dry  and  have  been 
broken  down  by  elephants  and  digging  a  large  pit,  we  will 
cremate  thee  at  the  time  indicated  by  thee.  Do  thou  tell  us 
who  has  carried  Sita  away  and  where  she  is  to  be  found. 
Render  us  this  great  service,  if  thou  art  acquainted  with  the 
truth." 

Thus  addressed  by  Rama,  Danu,  skilled  in  speech,  answered 
Raghava,  saying : — "  I  am  not  possessed  of  divine  foresight, 
neither  am  I  acquainted  with  the  Princess  Sita,  but  being 
cremated  by  thee,  resuming  my  natural  form,  I  shall  be  able 
to  point  out  one  to  thee,  who  will  know  what  has  become  of 
her.  Without  being  consumed  by  fire,  I  am  unable  to  tell 
thee  who  is  acquainted  with  that  titan  who  has  carried  Sita 
away.  Through  a  curse,  my  foresight  has  been  destroyed, 
O  Raghava,  and  through  mine  own  fault  I  have  become  an 
object  of  loathing  to  the  whole  world,  but  before  the  sun  with 
150 


ARANYA    KANDA 

his  tired  steeds  withdraws  behind  the  western  horizon  cast 
me  into  the  pit,  O  Rama,  and  cremate  me  according  to  the 
traditional  rites. 

"  Cremated  by  thee  with  due  ceremonial,  O  Joy  of  the 
House  of  Raghu,  I  shall  tell  thee  who  is  acquainted  with  that 
titan.  It  is  for  thee  to  seal  a  pact  of  friendship  with  him 
according  to  the  law.  O  Raghava,  that  swift-footed  hero  will 
lend  thee  his  assistance. 

"  For  one  reason  or  another,  he  has  traversed  the  Three 
Worlds  and  there  is  nothing  in  the  Universe  that  is  not  known 
to  him." 


CHAPTER     72 

Kabandha  tells  Rama  how  to  find  Sita 

After  Kabandha  had  spoken  thus,  those  two  warriors,  the 
foremost  among  men,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  sought  out  a 
hollow  on  the  mountain-side  and  ignited  a  fire.  With  the  aid 
of  glowing  brands,  Lakshmana  lit  the  pyre  that  burst  into 
flame  on  every  side.  The  vast  trunk  of  Kabandha  began  to 
melt  in  the  heat  of  the  fire  like  a  lump  of  butter,  and  later 
the  powerful  Kabandha,  scattering  the  ashes,  rose  up  from  the 
pyre  wearing  spotless  raiment  and  a  celestial  garland,  and  that 
handsome  demon,  his  limbs  covered  with  diverse  ornaments, 
ascended  a  chariot  of  dazzling  beauty  drawn  by  swans,  in  his 
splendour  illumining  the  ten  regions.  Thereafter,  standing  in 
the  sky,  he  addressed  Rama,  saying : — 

"  Learn,  O  Raghava,  by  what  means  thou  shalt  be  able  to 
recover  Sita.    There  are  six  expedients1  by  which  misfortune 

1  Six  expedients : 
Sand  hi — making  peace.

Yana — inarching  against  the  enemy. 
Ashana — maintaining  a  post  against  the  enemy. 
Daidibhava — sowing  dissention. 
Samshraya — seeking  the  protection  of  others.

may  be  combated,  and  in  the  light  of  which  all  things  should 
be  considered.  He  who  has  fallen  into  the  worst  misfortune 
may  find  solace  if  he  has  someone  with  whom  to  share  his  lot, 
but  thou  and  Lakshmana  are  deprived  of  this  consolation  in 
the  calamity  that  has  befallen  you  through  the  theft  of  Sita. 
O  Rama,  thou  who  art  thyself  the  foremost  of  friends  art  in 
need  of  a  friend.  After  due  reflection,  I  see  no  possibility 
of  success  for  thee  except  by  this. 

"  Hearken,  O  Rama,  to  what  I  am  about  to  tell  thee.  There 
is  a  monkey  named  Sugriva,  who  was  banished  in  anger  by 
his  brother  Bali,  the  son  of  Indra.  This  sagacious  and  valiant 
Sugriva  with  four  of  his  companions  inhabits  the  lofty  mountain 
Rishyamuka  situated  on  the  borders  of  Lake  Fampa. 

"  This  Indra  among  Monkeys,  who  is  full  of  energy  and 
prowess,  of  brilliant  appearance,  loyal,  temperate,  intelligent 
and  magnanimous,  skilful,  courageous,  wise  and  powerful, 
has  been  banished  by  his  brother  for  the  sake  of  the  kingdom. 
He  will  surely  prove  thy  friend  and  assist  thee  in  thy  search 
for  Sita.  O  Rama,  do  not  be  disturbed  on  this  account ; 
that  which  is  destined  must  come  to  pass.  O  Lion  among  the 
Ikshwakus,  fate  is  inexorable ! 

"  Do  thou  go  hence  with  all  speed,  O  Valiant  Raghava,  and 
seek  out  the  powerful  Sugriva.  Without  delay  conclude  an 
alliance  with  him  and,  swearing  mutual  loyalty  in  the  presence 
of  fire,  unite  thyself  with  that  beneficent  being.  Thou  shouldst 
not  disregard  that  King  of  the  Monkey  Tribe,  Sugriva,  who 
is  of  a  grateful  disposition,  able  to  change  his  form  at  will  and 
worthy  of  thy  friendship.  Thou  too  wilt  be  able  to  accomplish 
his  designs,  but  benefited  by  thee  or  no,  he  will  execute  thy 
purpose. 

"  This  son  of  Riksharajas'  consort  and  of  Bhaskara, 
wanders  about  resdessly  on  the  borders  of  Lake  Pampa  and  is 
at  war  with  Bali.  Laying  aside  thy  weapons,  seek  out  the 
retreat  of  that  monkey  on  the  Rishyamuka  Mountain  without 
delay  and  enter  into  a  bond  of  friendship  with  that  inhabitant 
of  the  forest.  That  Foremost  of  Monkeys  is  conversant  with 
all  the  haunts  of  the  flesh-eating  titans  in  the  world  and  has 
thoroughly  explored  their  retreats ;  there  is  nothing  on  this 
earth  that  is  not  known  to  him,  O  Raghava.

"  As  long  as  the  many-rayed  sun  continues  to  shine,  O 
Scourge  of  Thy  Foes,  he  with  his  companions  will  search 
the  rivers,  the  crags,  the  inaccessible  mountains  and  the  caves 
for  thy  consort.  He  will  send  out  his  monkeys  of  vast  stature  to 
scour  every  region  in  order  to  find  Sita,  separation  from  whom 
has  rent  thine  heart.  He  will  seek  for  Maithili  of  lovely  limbs 
even  in  Ravana's  own  abode.  Should  thine  irreproachable  and 
beloved  Sita  have  been  taken  to  the  summit  of  Mount  Meru  or 
abandoned  in  the  nethermost  hell,  that  Lion  among  the  Monkey 
Tribe,  having  slain  the  titans,  will  restore  her  to  thee." 


chapter    73 

Kabandka's  Counsel  to  Rama 

Having  revealed  the  way  to  recover  Sita,  the  resourceful 
Kabandha  counselled  Rama  in  the  following  significant  words, 
saying : — 

"  This  is  the  path  leading  westwards  to  the  Mount  Rish- 
yamuka,  O  Rama,  abounding  in  blossoming  trees ;  Jambu, 
Priyala,  Panasa,  Nyagrodha,  Plaksha,  Tinduka,  Ashwattha, 
Karnikara,  Cuta,  Naga,  Tilaka,  Naktamala,  Nilashoka,  Kadamba, 
Karavira,  Agnimukha,  Ashoka,  Raktachanda,  Paribhadraka  and 
many  other  trees  grow  there  and,  climbing  or  bending  them 
by  force,  they  should  be  used  by  you  to  sustain  yourselves  on 
the  way  with  their  sweet  fruits. 

"Passing  through  these  flowery  woodlands,  O  Kakutstha, 
thou  wilt  reach  others  resembling  the  Nandana  Gardens, 
where,  as  with  the  northern  Kurus,  the  trees  bear  fruit  and 
produce  honey  in  every  month  of  the  year  and  every  season 
is  represented  simultaneously  as  in  the  forest  of  Chaitaratha. 
There,  great  trees  with  mighty  branches,  bowed  under  the 
weight  of  their  fruit,  resemble  towering  clouds  on  the  mountain 
side.  Lakshmana  will  climb  those  trees  with  ease  or  pull 
them  down  to  offer  thee  the  fruit  equal  in  taste  to  the  Nectar 
of  Immortality.  Ranging  over  those  lovely  mountains,  wander- 
ing from  hill  to  hill  and  wood  to  wood,  O  Hero,  ye  shall  reach 
the  lake  Pampa  covered  with  lotuses,  free  from  boulders  and 
153 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

gravel,  whose  level  banks  present  no  crevice  and  therefore  no 
danger  of  falling.  O  Rama,  its  bed  is  sandy  and  it  is  covered 
with  floating  lilies ;  swans,  ducks,  herons  and  ospreys  are 
heard  calling  sweetly  on  the  waters  of  that  lake ;  nor  do  they 
fear  man,  O  Raghava,  since  none  has  ever  hunted  there.  Do 
ye  feed  on  these  birds,  fat  as  butter,  O  Rama,  as  well  as  on 
Rohita,  Chakratunda  and  Nala. 

"  O  Rama,  the  devoted  Lakshmana  will  offer  thee  diverse 
and  excellent  fish,  devoid  of  scale  or  fin,  plump,  possessing  a 
single  bone,  which  may  be  speared  with  arrows  and  roasted 
on  the  fire.  And  when  thou  hast  feasted,  Lakshmana,  drawing 
pure  water,  fragrant  with  the  scent  of  lotuses,  fresh,  limpid, 
sparkling  like  silver,  shall  offer  it  to  thee  on  a  lotus  leaf. 

"  In  the  evening,  ranging  here  and  there,  Lakshmana  will 
point  out  to  thee  the  great  monkeys  who  dwell  in  the  woods 
and  in  the  hollows  of  the  hills,  and  thou  shalt  see  those  wild 
and  savage  apes,  roaring  like  bulls,  coming  to  the  borders  of  the 
lake  to  drink. 

"  Wandering  abroad  at  dusk,  thy  grief  will  be  assuaged  on 
beholding  the  flowering  trees  and  the  auspicious  waters  of 
the  lake,  and  thou  shalt  see  the  blossoming  Tilaka  and  Naktamala 
trees  with  the  red  and  white  full-blown  lotuses,  which  will 
dispel  thy  sorrow.  .  No  man  has  ever  gathered  those  blooms 
nor  do  the  garlands  made  of  them  ever  fade  away,  O  Raghava, 
for  the  disciples  of  the  great  ascetic  Matanga  lived  there,  who, 
proficient  in  penance,  laden  with  the  wild  fruits  they  had 
collected  for  their  Guru,  covered  the  earth  with  drops  of  their 
perspiration  from  which  these  flowers  have  sprung;  by 
virtue  of  their  austerities  these  blooms  never  die. 

"  Those  ascetics  have  now  passed  away  but  there  still 
liveth  one  who  served  them,  a  mendicant  woman  named 
Shabari.  O  Kakutstha,  she,  who  is  ever  fixed  in  her  duty,  is 
now  extremely  old  and,  on  beholding  thee  who  art  honoured 
by  the  whole  world,  will  ascend  to  heaven. 

"  O  Rama,  having  reached  the  western  bank  of  Lake  Pampa, 
thou  shalt  see  a  lovely,  isolated  and  concealed  spot,  which  is 
Matanga's  hermitage.  There,  in  fear  of  his  divine  authority, 
no  elephant  dare  enter,  though  there  be  many.  This  place  is 
known  as  the  Matanga  Wood,  O  Raghava,  and  there,  0  Joy 
154 


ARANYA   KANDA 

of  the  House  of  Raghu,  where  every  variety  of  bird  sings  and 
which  resembles  the  Garden  of  Nandana  or  a  celestial  grove, 
thou  wilt  be  able  to  rest. 

"  The  Rishyamuka  mountain,  covered  with  flowering  trees 
and  filled  with  birds,  rises  opposite  Lake  Pampa  and  is  difficult 
of  access,  young  elephants  barring  the  way.  This  lofty  moun- 
tain was  formerly  created  by  Brahma  and  a  virtuous  man 
who  sleeps  on  its  summit  and  dreams  of  treasure  will  find 
wealth  on  waking,  whereas  an  evil-doer  who  attempts  to 
scale  it  will  be  seized  by  demons  while  yet  asleep.  There  too, 
the  trumpeting  of  the  young  elephants  who  disport  themselves 
in  the  Lake  Pampa  can  be  heard.  O  Rama,  in  that  part  of  the 
hermitage  where  Matanga  lodged  them,  wild  elephants  of 
vast  size,  streaming  with  crimson  ichor,  rush  to  the  lake,  full 
of  ardour,  like  great  clouds ;  there  they  slake  their  thirst  in 
the  cool  waters,  that  are  limpid,  pleasant  and  extremely 
auspicious  to  those  who  bathe  in  them  and  which  exhale  a 
sweet  fragrance.  Having  disported  themselves,  these  elephants 
re-enter  the  thickets  with  the  bears,  panthers  and  wolves. 
Beholding  them,  as  also  the  deer  of  gentle  countenance  re- 
sembling sapphire,  who  are  harmless  and  do  not  fear  man,  thy 
grief  will  be  assuaged. 

"  O  Kakutstha,  on  this  mountain,  hewn  out  of  the  rock 
is  a  great  cavern,  difficult  of  access,  covered  on  all  sides  with 
delightful  fruits,  and  at  the  entrance  is  a  great  lake  of  cool 
water  filled  with  every  kind  of  reptile ;  there  the  virtuous 
Sugriva  and  his  companions  dwell,  though  sometimes  he 
resides  on  the  summit  of  the  hill." 

Having  thus  instructed  the  two  princes,  Rama  and  Lakshmana, 
Kabandha,  resembling  the  sun  in  brilliance,  wreathed  in 
garlands,  illumined  the  heavens  with  his  splendour.  Thereupon 
those  two  heroes,  seeing  that  blessed  One  stationed  in  the  sky, 
spoke  unto  him,  saying :— "  Go  in  peace  !  "  whereto  Kabandha 
answered  saying : — "  Do  ye  proceed,  ye  will  achieve  your 
purpose ! " 

Then  Kabandha,  having  regained  his  pristine  beauty,  shining 
in  grace  and  splendour,  fixed  his  gaze  on  Rama  and  spoke 
again  from  the  sky,  saying : — "  Enter  into  an  alliance  with 
Sugriva." 

155 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER     74 

Rama  visits  Shabari 

The  two  princes,  following  the  instructions  of  Kabandha, 
proceeded  along  the  path  to  the  west  leading  to  Lake  Pampa. 
Wending  their  way,  desirous  of  finding  Sugriva,  they  gazed  on 
the  many  trees  laden  with  flowers  and  fruit,  tasting  of  nectar, 
growing  on  the  mountain-sides.  Passing  the  night  on  a 
plateau,  those  two  Descendants  of  Raghu  reached  the  western 
bank  of  the  Pampa  abounding  in  lotuses  and  beheld  Shabari's 
pleasant  retreat. 

Approaching  that  charming  hermitage,  shaded  on  all  sides 
by  innumerable  trees,  they  beheld  that  perfected  One  who, 
seeing  them,  rose  up  and  with  joined  palms  touched  the  feet 
of  Rama  and  the  prudent  Lakshmana  and,  according  to 
tradition,  offered  water  to  rinse  their  mouths  and  bathe  their 
feet. 

Thereupon  Rama  addressed  that  female  ascetic,  fixed  in  her 
spiritual  duty,  and  said : — "  Hast  thou  overcome  all  obstacles 
to  asceticism,  O  Thou  of  gentle  speech  ?  Do  thine  austerities 
increase  daily  ?  Hast  thou  subdued  thine  anger  and  thy  need 
for  food  ?  O  Solitary  One,  hast  thou  observed  thy  vows  and 
attained  inner  tranquillity  ?  Has  thine  attendance  on  thy 
Guru  borne  fruit  ?  " 

Thus  interrogated  by  Rama,  the  virtuous  Shabari,  revered 
by  the  Gods,  extremely  aged,  standing  before  him,  offered  him 
homage  and  said  : — 

"  Blessed  by  thy  presence,  I  have  acquired  perfection  and 
my  asceticism  is  crowned.  To-day  my  birth  has  borne  fruit 
and  the  service  of  my  Gurus  has  been  fully  honoured.  To-day 
my  pious  practices  have  found  fulfilment.  O  Foremost  of 
Men,  Greatest  of  the  Celestials,  worshipping  thee,  I  shall 
attain  the  heavenly  realm.  O  Gentle  One,  O  Slayer  of  thy 
Foes,  O  Thou  who  dost  confer  honour  on  men,  purified  by 
thy  compassionate  regard,  I  shall,  by  thy  favour,  attain  the 
imperishable  worlds,  O  Subduer  of  Thy  Foes. 
156 


ARANYA    KANDA 

"  When  thou  didst  set  foot  on  the  Mount  Chittrakuta,  those 
ascetics  I  served,  ascending  celestial  cars  of  incomparable 
splendour,  departed  to  heaven  and  those  great  sages,  conversant 
with  virtue,  said  to  me  : — 

" '  Rama  will  visit  thy  holy  retreat ;  do  thou  receive  him 
and  Lakshmana  with  traditional  hospitality.  On  beholding 
him,  thou  shalt  attain  the  highest  sphere  from  whence  none 
returneth.* 

"  O  Foremost  of  Men,  thus  did  those  blessed  ascetics  address 
me,  and  for  thee  I  have  gathered  the  wild  fruits  of  diverse 
kinds  that  grow  on  the  borders  of  Lake  Pampa." 

Hearing  these  words,  Raghava  said  to  her,  who  had  not  been 
left  in  ignorance  by  her  Gurus  concerning  the  past  and  the  future: — 

"  I  have  heard  the  truth  about  the  greatness  of  thy  Gurus 
from  Danu  and  now  I  would  fain  witness  it  with  mine  own 
eyes,  if  thou  judgest  it  fitting." 

Listening  to  these  words  falling  from  Rama's  own  lips, 
Shabari,  guiding  the  two  brothers  to  the  vast  forest,  addressed 
them,  saying : — 

"  O  Raghunanda,  behold  this  forest  resembling  a  dark  cloud, 
filled  with  birds  and  beasts,  known  as  the  Matanga  Wood. 
Here  my  Gurus  of  pure  soul  sacrificed  unto  fire,  their  persons 
consecrated  by  mantras  through  which  they  had  purified  them, 
thus  consecrating  the  forest  and  rendering  it  a  holy  place. 
Here  too  is  the  altar  facing  the  west,  where,  with  hands 
trembling  with  fatigue,  my  worshipful  preceptors  offered 
flowers  to  their  Gods.  O  Foremost  of  the  Raghus,  behold 
this  altar  of  incomparable  beauty,  which,  through  the  power  of 
their  penances,  still  sheds  its  lustre  illumining  the  four  regions. 
Behold  also  the  Seven  Seas,  drawn  here  by  virtue  of  their 
thought,  since,  through  fasting  and  the  weight  of  years,  they 
were  unable  to  walk.  These  robes  of  bark,  left  hanging  on  the 
trees  by  them  at  the  completion  of  their  ablutions,  are  still 
wet  and  the  lotuses  of  azure  hue  offered  by  them  in  worship 
have  not  faded. 

"  Now  thou  hast  seen  the  forest  and  hast  heard  all  that  thou 
didst  desire  to  know ;  I  will  abandon  my  body  so  that  I  may 
approach  those  pure-souled  ascetics  whom  I  used  to  wait  upon, 
to  whom  this  hermitage  belongs  and  whose  servant  I  am." 
157 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Hearing  these  pious  words,  Rama,  who  was  accompanied  by 
Lakshmana,    experienced    great    delight   and    exclaimed : 
"  Wonderful  it  is !  "   Thereafter,  addressing  Shabari  of  ascetic 
practices,  he  said : — 

**  O  Holy  One,  I  have  been  fully  honoured  by  thee ;  now 
repair  whither  thou  wilt  and  be  happy." 

Having  received  permission  from  Rama  to  depart,  Shabari, 
wearing  matted  locks,  robes  of  bark  and  a  black  antelope  skin, 
cast  herself  into  the  fire,  thereafter  rising  into  the  air  like  a 
bright  flame. 

Adorned  with  celestial  ornaments,  wreathed  in  garlands, 
emitting  a  divine  fragrance,  sprinkled  with  sandal-paste  and 
clad  in  celestial  raiment,  she  appeared  exquisite  and  illumined 
the  heavens  like  a  flash  of  lightning.  By  virtue  of  her  medita- 
tions she  ascended  to  those  sacred  abodes  where  her  spiritual 
preceptors,  those  bigh-souled  ascetics,  dwelt. 


chapter    75 

Rama  reaches  the  Lake  Pampa 

When  Shabari  had  ascended  to  heaven  through  the  merit  of 
her  spiritual  prowess,  Rama  with  bis  brother  Lakshmana 
began  to  ponder  over  the  pious  influence  of  those  great  ascetics 
and,  reflecting  within  himself  on  the  divine  authority  of  those 
holy  men,  Raghava  said  to  his  brother  : — 

"  O  Friend,  I  have  now  visited  the  retreat  of  those  magnani- 
mous sages  of  miraculous  deeds,  where  deer  and  tigers  roam, 
together  with  birds  of  every  kind.  O  Lakshmana,  we  have 
performed  our  ablutions  in  the  sacred  waters  of  these  seven 
seas  and  have  offered  oblations  to  our  ancestors.  Our  evil 
karma  has  thereby  been  destroyed  and  prosperity  made 
manifest;  my  heart  is  filled  with  peace.  Methinks,  O  Lion 
among  Men,  that  we  shall  soon  meet  with  good  fortune. 
Come,  let  us  walk  towards  the  enchanting  Lake  Pampa  !  The 
Rishyamuka  Mountain  may  be  seen  in  the  distance;  it  is 
158 


ARANYA    KANDA 

there  that  the  four  great  monkeys  with  Sugriva,  Surya's  son, 
dwell  in  constant  fear  of  Bali.  I  am  impatient  to  see  this 
Lion  of  the  Monkey  Tribe,  Sugriva,  for  it  is  he  who  will 
ascertain  where  Sita  can  be  found." 

Thus  did  the  heroic  Rama  speak,  and  Saumitri  answered 
him,  saying : — 

"  Let  us  repair  thither  without  delay ;  my  heart  too  reaches 
out  to  that  place."  Thereupon,  issuing  from  Matanga's 
hermitage,  the  mighty  Rama,  Lord  of  Men,  accompanied  by 
Lakshmana,  proceeded  towards  lake  Pampa. 

On  every  side  he  saw  innumerable  trees  in  full  flower  and 
pools  where  small  white  cranes  nested  in  the  reeds,  and  peacocks, 
lapwings  and  woodpeckers,  rilling  the  forest  with  their  cries,  as 
also  a  multitude  of  other  birds. 

Enjoying  the  trees  of  varying  fragrance  and  the  many  ponds, 
Rama,  transported  with  delight,  approached  one  whose  waters, 
delicious  to  the  taste,  were  drawn  from  the  Matanga  lake. 
There  the  two  Descendants  of  Raghu  stood  in  quiet  recollection. 
Thereafter,  grief  once  more  invading  the  heart  of  Raghu,  the 
son  of  Dasaratha,  he  entered  the  enchanting  lake  covered  with 
lotuses. 

Adorned  on  all  sides  with  Tilaka,  Ashoka,  Punnaga,  Vakula 
and  Uddalaka  trees,  which  were  nourished  by  its  waters,  it 
was  framed  in  charming  groves  and  its  waves,  pure  as  crystal, 
on  which  hibiscus  blooms  floated,  flowed  over  fine  sand.  Fish 
and  turtle  abounded  there  and  the  banks  were  embellished  by 
trees  intertwined  with  friendly  creepers.  Kinneras,  Uragas, 
Gandharvas,  Yakshas  and  Rakshasas  frequented  it  and  diverse 
trees  and  shrubs  cast  their  shade  over  it.  That  lake  was 
verily  a  jewel  with  its  fresh  and  limpid  waters,  its  lotuses  and 
water-lilies  lending  it  a  coppery  sheen,  whilst  clumps  of 
nymphoae  cast  silvery  reflections  and  the  blue  of  sapphire 
was  added  by  other  flowers.  Aravinda  and  Utpala  blooms 
abounded  round  the  lake,  which  was  covered  with  innumerable 
lotuses,  whilst  groves  of  mango  in  flower  lent  their  shade,  and 
peacocks  filled  it  with  their  cries. 

Rama,  the  mighty  son  of  Dasaratha,  who  was  accompanied 
by  Lakshmana,  seeing  the  Lake  Pampa  adorned  like  a  bride 
with  Tilaka,  Bijapura,  Vata,  Lodhra,  Sukladruma,  Karavira, 
159 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Punnaga  in  flower,  bushes  of  Malati  and  Kunda,  Bandira, 

Nichula,  Ashoka,  Saptaparna,  Ketaka,  Atknukta  and  diverse 

other  trees  of  varying  perfume,  gave  expression  to  his  grief : — 

"  There  stands  on  the  right  bank  the  mountain  Rishyamuka, 

abounding  in  various  metals  and  famed  for  the  variety  of  its 

trees  and  flowers,  spoken  of  by  Kabandha,  where  the  son  of 

the  magnanimous   Riksharajas,  the  valiant   Sugriva,   dwells. 

'  O  Foremost  of  Men,  seek  out  the  King  of  the  Monkeys ', 

were  his  words." 

Thereafter,  Rama  spoke  to  Lakshmana  again,  saying : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  how  will  Sita  be  able  to  live  without  me?" 

Having  spoken   thus  to  Lakshmana,  the  foremost  of  the 

Raghus,  tormented  by  his  love,  which  precluded  him  from 

thinking  of  aught  else,  entered  the  marvellous  Lake  Pampa, 

having  given  voice  to  his  sorrow. 

Proceeding  slowly,  observing  the  forest,  Rama,  coming  to 
Lake  Pampa,  surrounded  on  all  sides  with  enchanting  groves, 
filled  with  a  multitude  of  birds,  entered  its  waters  with 
Lakshmana.

CHAPTER     I 

Rama  describes  the  Spring  and  the  Sentiments  it  evokes  in  him 

Directing  his  steps  towards  Lake  Pampa,  which  was  covered 
with  lotuses  of  various  kinds,  Rama,  who  was  accompanied  by 
Lakshmana,  his  mind  troubled,  began  to  lament.  Beholding 
that  lake,  his  heart  was  filled  with  delight,  and  under  the  sway 
of  love,  he  said  to  the  son  of  Sumitra  : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  how  beautiful  is  the  Lake  Pampa  with  its 
pure  and  limpid  waves,  its  lotuses  and  flowering  water-lilies, 
its  many  kinds  of  trees.  Oh  !  How  delightful !  O  Saumitri, 
observe  the  Pampa  Woods,  how  pleasant  they  are  to  look  upon, 
those  magnificent  trees  resembling  crested  mountains.  I  am 
overwhelmed  and  stricken  with  grief  on  recollecting  Bharata's 
distress  and  the  abduction  of  Sita. 

"  Though  my  heart  is  heavy,  yet  the  Pampa  lake  is  still  able 
to  charm  me,  with  its  ravishing  woods  luxuriant  with  every 
kind  of  blossom  and  its  fresh  and  delicious  waters.  The  month 
of  flowering  lotuses1  lends  it  an  extreme  beauty ;  serpents  and 
wild  animals  frequent  it,  whilst  deer  and  birds  abound.  The 
thick  grass,  of  a  deep  emerald  hue,  is  sprinkled  with  different 
flowers  that  have  fallen  from  the  trees  and  resembles  a  bright 
carpet.  On  every  side  the  tops  of  the  trees,  bending  under  the 
weight  of  their  blossom,  are  wholly  hidden  by  the  creepers 
with  their  flowering  fronds. 

"  O  Lakshmana,  it  is  the  season  of  auspicious  breezes  and 
tender  love,  the  fragrant  spring  month  when  flowers  and  fruit 
are  brought  to  birth  on  the  trees.  See  how  lovely  are  these 
flowering  woods,  O  Saumitri,  showering  down  a  rain  of  petals, 
like  water  from  the  clouds. 

"  In  the  enchanting  valleys  on  the  escarpments,  innumerable 
trees,  shaken  by  the  wind,  scatter  their  blossom  on  the  earth. 
O  Lakshmana,  see  how  the  breeze,  agitating  the  myriad  branches

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  the  flowering  trees,  seems  to  play  with  the  blossom  that  has 
fallen  or  is  still  on  the  trees.  The  God  of  the  Wind  frolics 
to  the  accompaniment  of  the  humming  of  bees  and  to  the  song 
of  the  amorous  nightingale,  desiring,  as  it  were,  to  make  the 
trees  dance.  Emerging  from  the  mountain  caves,  the  wind 
gives  forth  a  kind  of  music,  shaking  the  trees  violently  from 
side  to  side,  causing  the  extreme  tips  of  their  branches  to  meet, 
uniting  them  one  with  the  other.  The  zephyr  with  soft  caress- 
ing breath,  diffusing  the  perfume  of  sandalwood,  dispels  all 
fatigue. 

"  Agitated  by  the  wind,  these  trees  seem  to  add  their  voices 
to  the  humming  of  the  bees  amidst  the  soft  and  fragrant  groves. 
"  On  the  enchanting  mountain  plateaus,  the  crags,  whose 
points  touch,  resplendent  with  large  trees  bearing  beautiful 
flowers,  sparkle  with  beauty,  and  the  trees,  tossed  by  the  airy 
currents  that  stir  them,  their  crests  covered  with  blossom  and 
crowned  with  bees,  seem  about  to  break  into  song. 

**  See,  on  every  side,  the  marvellous  blossoming  of  the 
golden  Karnikara  trees,  resembling  men  robed  in  silk !  This 
season  of  Spring,  0  Lakshmana,  with  its  choir  of  birds  of 
every  kind  revives  the  pain  caused  by  Sita's  absence.  In  this 
overwhelming  grief,  pangs  of  love  torment  me.  The  gay 
trilling  of  the  cuckoo  tantalizes  me ;  the  joyful  Datyuhaka 
bird  that  sings  from  the  waterfalls  of  the  forest  increases  my 
pain,  O  Lakshmana !  Formerly  when  she  heard  its  voice  in 
our  hermitage,  my  beloved,  intoxicated  with  love  and  happiness, 
would  call  to  me. 

"  See  how  the  birds  of  varied  plumage,  giving  forth  every 
kind  of  note,  seek  refuge  on  all  sides  amongst  the  trees,  bushes 
and  creepers !  The  females  accompanied  by  the  males 
flock  together  according  to  their  kind  and  rejoice ;  intoxicated 
by  the  Bhringaraja's  exultant  cries,  they  chirrup  melodiously. 
Here,  in  the  home  of  Sita,  the  assembled  birds  are  made  merry 
by  the  joyous  song  of  the  Datyuhaka  responding  to  the  cuckoo's 
call. 

"  The  rustling  of  the  trees  rekindles  the  fire  of  my  love,  of 
which  the  bunches  of  the  Ashoka  blooms  are  the  fuel,  the 
humming  of  the  bees  the  crackling,  and  the  buds  the  golden 
tongues  of  flame.

KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

"  This  fire  of  Spring  is  consuming  me  !  Nay,  far  from  that 
lady  of  lovely  eyelashes,  beautiful  looks  and  gentle  speech,  I 
cannot  survive,  O  Saumitri !  The  season  that  brings  delight 
to  the  woods  is  the  time  she  loved,  and  beyond  all,  she  was 
enamoured  of  the  forest  echoing  to  the  call  of  the  cuckoo  on 
every  side,  O  Irreproachable  Hero  ! 

"  The  tender  feelings  I  bear  for  my  sweet  One  and  the 
delights  of  Spring  that  increase  them  are  a  burning  fire  that 
will  soon  consume  me  utterly.  I  shall  not  live  long  separated 
from  my  spouse ;  the  beauty  of  these  trees  increases  the  pangs 
of  my  love.  Being  unable  to  see  Sita  any  more  intensifies  my 
anguish,  whilst  the  presence  of  Spring  causes  the  sweat  of 
desire  to  break  forth  on  me.  Thinking  of  that  lady,  whose 
eyes  resemble  a  doe's,  grief  holds  me  in  thrall ;  the  cruel  Spring 
breeze  from  the  woods  tortures  mc,  O  Saumitri ! 

"  Here  and  there,  peacocks  dance,  spreading  their  brilliant 
wings  in  the  breeze,  and  their  tails,  decorated  with  eyes, 
resemble  crystal  lattices.  The  females  surrounding  them  are 
intoxicated  with  desire  and  this  strengthens  the  love  with  which 
I  am  filled. 

"  See,  O  Lakshmana,  on  the  mountain  plateau,  how  the 
peacock  dances  and  how  the  peahen,  her  heart  intoxicated  with 
joy,  closely  follows  him !  He  spreads  his  radiant  wings  and 
his  cries  seem  to  mock  my  pain,  for  in  the  forest  his  loved  one 
has  not  been  carried  away  by  a  titan  and  he  can  dance  in  these 
enchanting  groves  with  his  tender  love.  In  this  month  of 
flowers,  in  Sita's  absence,  my  stay  here  is  unendurable ! 

"  See,  O  Lakshmana,  love  is  found  even  among  lower  animals! 
At  this  moment,  the  peahen  is  ardently  attracted  to  the  steps 
of  the  male ;  even  thus  would  the  large-eyed  daughter  of 
Janaka  follow  my  steps  with  renewed  love,  had  she  not  been 
borne  away. 

"  O  Lakshmana,  the  flowers  that  bear  down  the  forest 
branches  with  their  weight  in  the  autumn  will  produce  no 
fruit  for  me  and,  though  so  lovely,  will  fall  rotting  to  the 
ground  with  their  swarms  of  bees. 

"  The  birds  at  this  time,  in  joyous  flight,  carolling  in  love, 
seem  to  call  to  one  another,  invoking  deep  transports  of  desire 
in  me.    If  the  Spring  also  reigns  where  my  loved  one,  Sita, 
165 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALM1KI 

dwells,  who  has  now  fallen  under  the  sway  of  another,  she 
will  be  sharing  my  ardour.  Yet  if  the  Spring  has  not  reached 
that  place  where  she  is,  how  will  that  dark-eyed  lady  be  able 
to  go  on  living  in  my  absenec  ?  If  this  season  has  not  come 
to  where  my  gentle  love  resides,  what  will  that  fair-limbed  lady 
do,  who  has  been  overpowered  by  a  mighty  adversary  ?  My 
youthful  and  beloved  consort,  whose  eyes  resemble  lotus  petals 
and  who  is  gentle  of  speech,  will  certainly  yield  up  her  life  at 
the  first  breath  of  Spring.  In  my  heart,  I  feel  assured  that 
the  gentle  Sita  will  not  be  able  to  survive  separation  from  me. 
Devotion  to  Vaidehi  invades  my  entire  being  and  my  love  is 
wholly  centred  on  her. 

"  When  I  remember  my  gentle  love,  this  caressing  breeze, 
so  fresh  and  cool,  carrying  the  fragrance  of  flowers,  is  like  a 
burning  fire  to  me.  The  God  of  the  Wind,  who  was  ever 
welcome  when  Sita  was  present,  is  to-day  a  source  of  pain  to  me. 
In  her  absence,  that  bird  flying  through  the  air  emitting 
cries,  the  crow  now  perching  on  a  tree,  makes  a  delightful  sound.1 
This  winged  creature  will  prove  a  messenger  and  bring  my 
remembrance  to  the  mind  of  the  large-eyed  Vaidehi. 

"  Listen,  O  Lakshmana,  to  the  birds'  intoxicating  chorus  of 
love,  as  they  warble  in  the  flowery  crested  trees.  That  bee 
suddenly  flying  towards  the  young  green  shoots  of  the  Tilaka 
tree,  blown  by  the  breeze,  is  like  a  lover  trembling  with  desire. 
The  Ashoka  tree,  that  increases  the  torment  of  lovers,  rises 
with  its  plumes  of  flowers  waving  in  the  wind,  to  tantalize  me. 
Look,  O  Lakshmana,  at  the  flowering  mango  trees,  resembling 
those  who  are  distracted  by  the  pangs  of  love ! 

"  O  Saumitri,  O  Lion  among  Men !  See  how  amidst  the 
magnificent  range  of  trees  that  grow  on  the  borders  of  Lake 
Pampa,  the  Kinneras  wander  about  on  every  side !  Observe 
those  Nalina  flowers  of  subtle  scent,  O  Lakshmana,  gleaming 
on  the  water  like  unto  the  sun  about  to  rise.  See  the  calm 
surface  of  the  Pampa  Lake,  fragrant  with  lotus  and  blue  water- 
lilies,  frequented  by  swans  and  waterfowl,  and  the  stamens  of 
the  lotus  flowers,  bright  as  the  dawn,  that  the  bees  have  scattered 
on  the  waves. 

1  This  refers  to  a  crow  cawing  at  the  time  of  Rama's  wedding,  indicating 
that  he  would   shortly  be  separated   from   her  ;    now   the   sound  signifies 


KISHKINDHA    KA'NDA 

"  How  the  Lake  Parapa  sparkles  !  Waterfowl  abound  there 
in  every  season ;  how  wonderful  are  its  woodland  glades ! 
It  is  enchanting  with  its  herds  of  elephants  and  deer,  that  love 
to  come  and  bathe  in  it.  The  water-lilies  rocking  on  the 
breast  of  the  limpid  waves,  the  waters  whipped  by  the  impetuous 
wind  sparkle  with  beauty,  O  Lakshmana. 

"  Far  from  Vaidehi,  whose  eyes  are  as  large  as  the  petals  of 
of  the  lotus,  who  ever  loved  the  water-lilies,  life  has  no  attraction 
for  me.  O  Perfidious  Kama,  now  I  am  no  longer  able  to  rejoin 
her,  thou  seekest  to  evoke  in  me  the  memory  of  that  sweet 
lady,  whose  speech  was  a  thousand  times  sweeter  still;  it  were 
possible  to  bear  the  love  I  feel  for  her,  if  the  Spring  with  its 
flowers  and  trees  did  not  increase  my  torment !  Those  things 
that  enchanted  me,  when  I  was  with  her,  in  her  absence,  have 
no  further  charm  for  me.  On  seeing  the  petals  of  the  lotus 
cup,  I  say  to  myself :  '  These  resemble  Sita's  eyes  ',  O  Laksh- 
mana. The  fragrant  breeze,  blowing  through  the  stamens  of  the 
lotus  flowers  and  the  trees,  resembles  her  breath. 

"  O  Saumitri,  see  how  marvellous  is  the  brilliance  of  the 
flowering  trunk  of  the  Karnikara  on  the  ridges  of  the  mountain 
to  the  right  of  Lake  Pampa.  Those  ravishing  trees  with  their 
flowers,  stripped  of  leaves,  seem  to  set  the  mountain  ridges  on 
fire ;  whilst  those  growing  on  the  banks  of  the  lake,  that  irrigates 
them,  give  off  a  delicate  perfume. 

"  Malatis,  Mallikas,  Karaviras  and  Padmas  in  flower, 
Ketaki,  Sinduvara  and  Vasanti  trees,  Matulinga,  Purna  and 
Kunda  bushes  on  every  side;  Shiribilva,  Madhuka,  Vanjula, 
Bakula,  Champaka,  Tilaka,  Nagavriksha,  Padmaka,  Ashoka 
with  their  azure  flowers,  Lodhra,  Simhakesara,  Pinjara  trees 
are  seen  everywhere.  Ankola,  Kuranta,  Shurnaka,  Pari- 
bhadraka,  Cuta,  Pataii,  Kovidara,  Mucukunda  and  Arjuna 
trees  spread  their  blossom  on  the  slope  of  the  mountain.  Rakta- 
kurava,  Ketaka,  Uddalaka,  Shirisha,  Shingshapa,  Dhava, 
Shalmali,  Kingshuka,  Kurubaka  with  its  red  flowers,  Tinisha, 
Naktamala,  Candaka,  Syandana,  Hintala,  Tilaka  and  Naga- 
vriksha,  these  blossoming  trees  are  entwined  with  flowering 
spiked  creepers. 

"  See,  O  Saumitri,  how  they  crowd  together  on  the  banks  of 
Lake  Pampa,  their  branches  waving  in  the  wind ;  the  creepers 
167 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

seem  to  be  pursuing  each  other,  resembling  lovely  women 
at  play. 

"  The  breeze  passes  through  the  trees  from  crag  to  crag, 
from  wood  to  wood.  Amongst  them,  some  are  in  full  flower 
and  give  off  a  soft  fragrance,  others,  covered  with  buds,  have 
a  sombre  air.    What  sweetness !  How  pleasant !  What  blossom! 

"Amidst  these  trees  on  the  borders  of  Lake  Pampa,  the 
bees  seem  to  be  resting  in  the  heart  of  the  flowers,  staying  a 
moment,  then  flying  off  again,  quickly  alighting  elsewhere, 
greedy  for  nectar. 

"  The  fortunate  earth  is  heaped  with  masses  of  blossom  that 
has  fallen  on  the  ground,  resembling  the  covering  of  a  couch. 
On  the  mountain  sides  unrolls  a  brilliant  carpet  of  gold  and  red 
flowers  of  every  kind,  O  Saumitri.  At  the  end  of  winter  all 
these  trees  are  now  in  full  flower,  O  Lakshmana.  In  this 
month  of  blossom,  the  plants  open,  vying  with  each  other, 
and  the  trees,  where  the  six-legged  insects  hum,  seem  to 
challenge  one  another,  manifesting  a  great  brilliance,  their 
branches  crowned  with  flowers. 

"  The  Karandava  bird  plunging  into  the  limpid  waves,  dis- 
porting itself  with  its  mate,  seems  in  some  way  to  inspire  love. 
Like  that  of  the  Mandakini,  the  beauty  of  the  Lake  Pampa  is 
enchanting ;  its  perfections  are  famed  throughout  the  world 
and,  in  proximity,  ravish  the  heart. 

"  If  I  might  find  my  gentle  Love  once  again,  and  we  could 
take  up  our  abode  here,  I  should  not  even  covet  India's  realm 
or  regret  Ayodhya.  Here,  on  these  charming  slopes,  I  should 
sport  with  her  and  neither  my  thoughts  nor  desires  would 
lead  me  away. 

"  In  the  absence  of  my  beloved,  the  trees  of  these  woods, 
wholly  covered  with  every  kind  of  flower,  almost  deprive  me 
of  my  reason. 

"  Gaze  on  this  lake  of  limpid  waters,  O  Saumitri,  which  is 
covered  with  lotuses,  frequented  by  the  Chakravaka  bird,  the 
abode  of  Karandavas,  abounding  in  pelicans,  herons  and  wild 
beasts  and  re-echoing  to  the  warbling  of  birds;  verily  Lake 
Pampa  is  a  paradise !  The  myriad  birds  with  their  delightful 
antics  and  the  memory  of  that  youthful  woman,  my  beloved, 
whose  face  shines  like  the  moon,  whose  eyes  resemble  lotuses, 
168 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

all  inflame  my  desire.  I,  who  am  separated  from  Sita,  whose 
eyes  resemble  the  doe's  and  the  gazelle's,  on  seeing  them  dis- 
porting themselves  there,  am  troubled,  as  it  were. 

"  On  that  pleasant  hillside,  filled  with  flocks  of  birds,  intoxi- 
cated with  love,  might  I  but  see  my  gentle  One,  I  should  be 
content.  O  Saumitri,  I  should  certainly  live  anew  if  Sita  of 
slender  waist  were  inhaling  the  auspicious  air  of  Lake  Pampa 
at  my  side.  Fortunate  is  he,  O  Lakshmana,  who  drinks 
that  pleasant  air  from  the  woods  of  Lake  Pampa  that  carries 
the  fragrance  of  the  lotus  and  dispels  all  grief. 

"  How  is  that  youthful  woman,  whose  eyes  resemble  lotus 
petals,  the  beloved  daughter  of  Janaka,  able  to  bear  the  exist- 
ence of  a  slave  ?  What  shall  I  say  to  that  virtuous  king,  the 
faithful  Janaka,  when,  in  the  presence  of  the  people,  he  asks 
me  if  all  is  well  with  Sita  ? 

"  She  who  followed  me  to  the  dreary  forest  whither  my  father 
had  banished  me,  that  Sita,  fixed  in  her  duty,  where  is  she, 
my  beloved,  now  ?  Separated  from  her,  how,  in  mine  adversity, 
O  Lakshmana,  shall  I  be  able  to  endure  life  ?  I  am  losing 
my  reason!  When  shall  I  hear  the  incomparable  voice  of 
Vaidehi  again  ?  Though  she  found  nought  but  misfortune  in 
the  forest,  yet  that  youthful  woman,  in  her  tenderness,  con- 
versed sweetly  with  me,  who  was  consumed  with  love,  as  if 
she  had  ceased  to  be  unhappy  and  was  full  of  joy.  How  shall 
I,  in  Ayodhya,  reply  to  Kaushalya,  O  Prince,  when  that  vener- 
able queen  asks  me  :  '  Where  is  my  daughter-in-law  and  what 
has  befallen  her  ? ' 

"  O  Lakshmana,  return  and  seek  out  Bharata,  our  devoted 
brother;  as  for  me,  I  can  no  longer  continue  living  without 
the  daughter  of  Janaka." 

Thus  did  the  magnanimous  Rama  lament,  as  if  deprived  of 
support,  and  his  brother,  Lakshmana,  in  judicious  and  measured 
words,  answered  him,  saying : — "  O  Rama,  summon  up  thy 
courage  and  be  happy,  do  not  grieve,  O  Thou,  the  Best  of  Men. 
Those  in  thy  condition  have  nothing  with  which  to  reproach 
themselves  and  should  not  give  way  to  despair.  Calling  to 
remembrance  the  grief  caused  by  separation  from  that  being 
who  is  dear  to  thee,  banish  all  excessive  attachment.  In 
proximity  to  intense  heat,  even  a  damp  net  catches  fire.  Though

be  descend  into  hell  or  yet  lower,  Ravana  will  in  no  way 
survive  his  deed,  O  Beloved  Rama.  Let  us  first  seek  out  this 
wicked  demon ;  either  he  shall  yield  up  Sita  or  he  is  lost. 
Should  Ravana  descend  into  the  womb  of  Diti1  with  Sita, 
I  shall  slay  him  if  he  does  not  restore  her  to  thee.  Return 
to  thy  normal  state,  My  Noble  Friend,  and  throw  off  these 
mournful  thoughts.  Assuredly  no  success  is  gained  by  those 
who  abandon  their  undertakings  without  making  due  efforts. 
Exertion  is  a  powerful  weapon,  O  Lord,  there  is  no  power 
superior  to  it.  With  effort,  nothing  is  impossible  in  this 
world.  Resolute  men  do  not  fail  in  their  pursuits.  By  our 
efforts  alone  we  shall  recover  Janaki.  Do  not  permit  thyself 
to  be  dominated  by  thy  love  or  thy  grief;  cast  it  behind  thee. 
Hast  thou  perchance  forgotten  the  greatness  of  thy  soul,  the 
fixity  of  thy  purpose  and  character  ?  " 

Thus  spurred  on  by  Lakshmana,  Rama,  who  had  allowed 
himself  to  be  overcome  by  sorrow,  banished  his  grief  and 
distraction  and  regained  his  valour. 

Calm  and  brave  beyond  imagining,  Rama  crossed  the  Pampa 
that  was  full  of  charm,  enchanting  with  its  trees  of  waving 
branches.  When  he  had  explored  the  whole  forest  with  its 
waterfalls  and  ravines,  the  magnanimous  Rama,  agitated  and 
overcome  with  grief,  set  out  with  Lakshmana,  and  with  the 
joyous  gait  of  an  elephant  intoxicated  with  Mada  juice,  the 
intrepid  and  magnanimous  Saumitri,  with  rapid  strides  went 
on  his  way  serenely,  consoling  Rama  by  his  fidelity  and  valour. 

As  they  neared  the  vicinity  of  Rishyamuka,  the  King  of  the 
Monkeys  observed  those  heroes  of  unusual  aspect  and,  despite 
his  courage,  trembled  but  made  no  move  towards  them.  That 
magnanimous  monkey,  who  walked  with  the  dignity  of  an 
elephant,  seeing  those  two  brothers  advancing,  was  filled  with 
extreme  apprehension  and  became  distracted  with  fear. 

In  their  terror  at  the  sight  of  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  those 
monkeys  concealed  themselves  in  that  pleasant  solitude,  the 
refuge  of  the  Deer  of  the  Trees.8

Sugriva  sends  Hanuman  to  interview  Rama 

Beholding  those  two  illustrious  brothers,  Rama  and  Laksbmana, 
bearing  great  swords  in  their  hands,  Sugriva  grew  anxious  and, 
with  a  beating  heart,  glancing  round  on  every  side,  could  find 
no  place  in  which  to  take  refuge.  Seeing  those  two  heroes, 
he  moved  about  restlessly  from  place  to  place  and,  in  his  terror, 
felt  himself  about  to  swoon.  Exceedingly  perturbed,  the 
virtuous  Sugriva  with  his  companions  began  to  ponder  on  the 
varying  aspects  of  the  situation  and  that  Chief  of  the  Monkey 
Tribe,  pointing  out  those  two  warriors,  Rama  and  Lakshmana, 
to  his  ministers,  said  : — 

"  Without  doubt,  Bali  has  sent  these  two  heroes  to  this  wood, 
which  is  inaccessible  to  him,  and  they,  assuming  robes  of  bark, 
have  come  hither  and  have  penetrated  this  stronghold.'* 

Then  those  counsellors  of  Sugriva,  perceiving  the  two 
skilful  archers,  sped  away  from  that  ridge  to  a  higher  crest, 
slipping  off  hurriedly  behind  their  leader  and  thereafter  they 
encircled  that  King  of  the  Forest  Dwellers.  In  close  formation, 
they  leapt  from  crag  to  crag,  causing  the  rocks  to  tremble  with 
their  bounds.  Jumping  with  extreme  force,  they  broke  down 
the  flowering  trees  growing  in  that  altitude  and  those  amazing 
monkeys,  leaping  in  every  direction  on  that  great  mountain, 
struck  terror  in  the  hearts  of  the  deer,  the  wild  cats  and  the 
tigers. 

Thereafter,  the  counsellors  of  Sugriva,  assembling  on  that 
Indra  of  mountains,  gathered  round  their  sovereign  with 
joined  palms,  and  the  eloquent  Hanuman  addressed  Sugriva, 
who  in  his  terror  suspected  some  project  of  his  brother's  to  be 
afoot,  saying : — 

"  Let  all  banish  fear  of  Bali !  There  is  nothing  to  inspire 
terror  on  this,  the  highest  of  mountains.  I  do  not  see  any 
sign  here  of  that  cruel  Bali  of  evil  aspect,  who  has  filled  thee 
171 


THE    RAMAYAKA    OF    VALMIKI 

with  apprehension  and  caused  thy  flight,  O  Bull  among 
Monkeys.  That  cunning  creature  whom  thou  fearest,  thy 
wicked  elder  brother,  is  not  here,  O  Friend :  I  see  no  cause  for 
thine  apprehension.  It  is  evident,  O  Plavamgama,  that  thy 
simian  nature  is  asserting  itself,  since,  by  giving  way  to  dis- 
traction of  mind,  thou  art  not  able  to  see  clearly.  Thou  art 
intelligent,  experienced,  able  to  read  the  expression  of  others 
and  fully  prepared  for  any  eventuality,  but  a  prince  who  gives 
way  to  agitation  is  not  able  to  forestall  any." 

Hearing  Hanuman's  pregnant  utterance,  Sugriva  answered 
him  with  greater  calm  saying : — 

"  Seeing  those  two  long-armed  warriors  of  large  eyes,  armed 
with  bows  and  swords,  resembling  the  offspring  of  the  Gods, 
who  would  not  be  afraid  ?  I  deem  these  two  powerful  heroes 
to  be  the  messengers  of  Bali.  Kings  have  many  friends,  and 
I  do  not  feel  able  to  trust  them.  Those  who  are  cautious 
invariably  find  the  weak  spot  in  those  who  are  over-confident. 
Bali  is  crafty  in  every  enterprise.  Those  monarchs  who  are 
well-informed  are  able  to  overcome  their  enemies  and  should 
spy  out  their  actions  with  the  help  of  ordinary  men. 

"  Go,  O  Plavamgama,  in  the  guise  of  a  common  man  and 
find  out  the  intentions  of  these  two  strangers.  Study  their 
gestures,  their  manners  and  their  speech  j  observe  their 
attitude  and  how  they  are  disposed. 

"  By  praise  and  repeated  courtesies  inspire  them  with 
confidence.  Interrogate  those  two  archers  in  my  name,  O 
Bull  amongst  Monkeys,  and  enquire  of  them  for  what  reason 
they  have  come  to  these  woods.  Discover  if  their  purpose 
be  honest,  O  Plavamgama;  their  speech  and  manner  will 
betray  them  if  they  are  ill-intentioned." 

Thus  commanded  by  Sugriva,  the  Son  of  Maruta  prepared 
to  seek  out  Rama  and  Lakshmana. 

His  master,  through  extreme  fear,  having  rendered  himself 
unapproachable,  the  monkey  Hanuman  of  noble  attributes, 
listening  to  his  words  with  respect,  answered :    "  Be  it  so  !  " 
and  went  forth  to  meet  the  mighty  Rama  and  Lakshmana 
who  accompanied  him.

CHAPTER     3 

Hanuman's  Meeting  with  Rama 

At  the  command  of  the  magnanimous  Sugriva,  Hanuman, 
with  one  bound,  left  the  Mountain  Rishyamuka  and  placed 
himself  in  the  path  of  the  two  Raghavas. 

Discarding  his  monkey  form,  Hanuman,  the  son  of  Maruta, 
by  the  power  of  illusion,  assumed  the  guise  of  a  wandering 
monk  and,  in  gentle  and  pleasing  tones,  addressed  those  two 
brothers  with  humility,  paying  obeisance  to  them. 

Approaching  those  two  heroes,  that  Foremost  of  Monkeys 
praised  them  as  they  deserved,  offering  them  every  courtesy 
and  in  accord  with  Sugriva's  wish  spoke  graciously  to  them, 
saying : — 

"  O  Ascetics  of  renowned  penance,  who  are  full  of  faith  and 
valour  and  who  resemble  the  Rishis  and  the  Gods,  why  have 
you  come  to  this  region,  sowing  fear  amongst  the  herds  of  deer 
and  other  denizens  of  the  forest,  surveying  the  trees  on  every 
side  that  grow  on  the  borders  of  Pampa,  that  lake  of  sparkling 
waves,  the  splendour  of  which  you  enhance  with  your  radiance, 
O  Heroes  of  Great  Daring  ? 

"  O  Valiant  Strangers,  who  are  you,  whose  skin  gleams  like 
gold  and  who  are  clad  in  robes  of  bark,  possessing  strong  arms, 
you  who  are  sighing  deeply  and  whose  sight  inspires  fear  in  all 
beings  ?  You  have  the  air  of  lions  or  warriors  who  are  full  of 
courage  and  heroism,  armed  as  you  are  with  bows,  resembling 
Indra's,  the  Destroyers  of  your  Foes  ? 

"  Full  of  majesty  and  beauty,  mighty  as  great  bulls,  your 
arms  resembling  the  trunks  of  elephants,  radiant,  the  first 
among  men,  youthful,  illumining  the  king  of  the  mountains  with 
your  effulgence,  you  who  are  worthy  of  ruling  kingdoms  and 
like  unto  the  Gods,  what  purpose  brings  you  here  ?  O  Heroes, 
whose  eyes  are  as  large  as  lotus  petals,  who  wear  your  matted 
locks  coiled  like  crowns  on  your  heads,  who  resemble  each 
173 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

other,  have  you  come  hither  from  the  celestial  region  ?  Verily 
the  sun  and  moon  have  descended  to  earth  of  their  own  free 
will.  O  Broad-chested  Warriors,  ye  who  are  men,  yet  nave 
the  aspect  of  divine  beings,  whose  shoulders  are  like  unto  a 
lion's,  who  are  endowed  with  great  strength  and  resemble  two 
bulls  intoxicated  with  desire,  whose  large  and  massive  arms 
look  like  clubs  that  should  be  adorned  with  every  kind  of 
ornament,  yet  bear  none,  it  seems  that  you  are  both  worthy 
of  ruling  the  whole  earth,  whose  decorations  are  the  Vindhya 
and  Mem  mountains  with  their  lakes  and  forests.  How 
beautiful  arc  your  two  shining  bows,  glistening  with  perfumed 
paste,  covered  with  gold  and  shining  like  the  mace  of  Indra ; 
the  two  quivers  also,  rilled  with  sharp  death-dealing  and 
formidable  arrows  resembling  hissing  snakes ;  your  two 
swords  of  immense  length  and  size,  encrusted  with  fine  gold 
that  gleam  like  serpents  that  have  just  cast  their  slough !  But 
why  do  ye  not  answer  me  ? 

"  Sugriva  is  the  name  of  that  virtuous  King  of  the  Monkeys, 
that  hero  banished  by  his  brother,  who  roams  the  earth  in 
great  distress.  I  have  come  here  under  the  orders  of  that 
magnanimous  one,  the  Chief  of  the  Great  Monkeys.  The 
illustrious  Sugriva  desires  your  friendship.  Know  me  to  be 
his  minister,  a  monkey,  the  son  of  Pavana,  ranging  where  I 
please  and  coming  here  under  the  guise  of  a  wandering  monk 
from  the  Rishyamuka  Mountain  in  order  to  please  him." 

Having  addressed  those  two  heroes,  Rama  and  Lakshmana, 
in  discreet  and  courteous  terms,  Hanuman  fell  silent  and  hearing 
that  speech,  the  blessed  Rama,  delighted,  addressed  Lakshmana 
who  stood  beside  him,  saying  : — 

"  This  is  the  minister  of  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  the 
magnanimous  Sugriva,  whom  I  seek.  O  Saumitri,  answer 
Sugriva's  counsellor  who  is  eloquent  and  warm-hearted  and 
the  subduer  of  his  foes  in  courteous  terms.  Only  one  versed 
in  the  Rig- Veda  and,  who  is  conversant  with  the  Yajur  and  the 
Sama  Vedas,  would  speak  thus.  He  has  studied  grammar 
thoroughly,  and  though  he  has  spoken  at  length,  it  has  been 
void  of  error.  I  see  naught  to  offend,  either  in  his  mouth, 
his  eyes,  his  brow,  limbs,  or  attitude.  His  speech  is  neither 
lacking  in  fulness,  depth,  assurance  or  distinction ;  his  voice 
174 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

issues  from  his  breast  in  clear  modulated  tones.  He  expresses 
himself  with  admirable  felicity  without  any  hesitation ;  his 
tone  is  harmonious  and  moves  the  heart  agreeably.  What  foe, 
having  drawn  his  sword,  would  not  be  disarmed  by  the  charm 
of  that  voice  that  enunciates  each  syllable  so  perfectly.  O 
Irreproachable  Prince,  the  king  who  employs  messengers 
gifted  with  such  talent  is  certain  to  succeed  in  all  his  under- 
takings, since  they  are  enhanced  at  the  very  outset,  by  such 
eloquence." 

On  this,  Saumitri  addressed  that  eloquent  minister  of 
Sugriva's  in  well-chosen  words,  saying : — "  O  Sage,  we  have 
been  told  of  the  great  attributes  of  Sugriva  and  are  at  this 
moment  looking  for  that  King  of  the  Monkeys.  That  which 
he  commands  we  will  carry  out  on  thine  instructions,  O 
Excellent  Hanuman." 

When  he  heard  this  gracious  speech,  that  monkey,  born  of 
Pavana,  who  wished  nothing  more  than  that  Sugriva  should 
triumph,  resolved  to  bring  about  a  friendly  alliance  between 
Rama  and  his  master. 


CHAPTER     4 

Hanuman  bears  Rama  and  Lakshmana  into  the  presence  of  Sugriva 

Listening  to  Lakshmana's  courteous  words  and  marking  the 
feeling  of  goodwill  towards  his  master,  Hanuman,  deeming 
Rama  would  be  willing  to  assist  him,  joyfully  reflected  that 
Sugriva's  triumph  was  already  assured. 

He  thought :  "  Undoubtedly  the  magnanimous  Sugriva  will 
not  fail  to  regain  his  kingdom,  for  here  is  one  who  will  enable 
him  to  accomplish  his  design." 

Then  the  wholly  delighted  and  eloquent  Hanuman,  the 
Foremost  of  Monkeys,  said  to  Rama: — "What  brings  thee 
with  thy  younger  brother  to  this  perilous  and  inaccessible 
forest  ?  " 

On  this  enquiry,   Lakshmana,  prompted  by  his  brother, 
related  the  history  of  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  to  him. 
175 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  There  was  a  king  named  Dasaratha,  who  was  illustrious, 
fixed  in  his  duty  and,  according  to  the  law,  the  protector  of 
the  four  castes.  Without  a  foe,  he  himself  hating  none,  he 
appeared  to  all  living  beings  to  be  a  second  Brahma. 

"  The  firstborn  son  of  Dasaratha,  who  possessed  every 
excellent  quality,  the  refuge  of  all,  endowed  with  royal  virtues 
and  of  great  majesty,  was  banished  from  his  dominion  and 
obedient  to  the  behests  of  his  sire,  has  come  to  dwell  in  the 
forest.  Submitting  to  the  paternal  decree,  he  was  followed 
by  his  consort,  Sita,  as  the  glorious  sun  by  the  sunset  glow 
at  evening. 

"  My  name  is  Lakshmana.  I,  who  am  inferior  to  him  in 
every  respect,  am  his  brother  and  accompany  him  as  his 
servant.  This  dutiful  prince,  who  is  ever  mindful  of  what 
should  be  done,  is  extremely  learned  and  this  hero,  who  spends 
his  life  in  promoting  the  welfare  of  all  beings,  who  is  worthy 
of  happiness  and  honour,  deprived  of  supreme  power,  passes 
his  days  in  the  forest.  A  titan,  who  was  able  to  change  his 
form  at  will,  carried  off  his  consort,  she  being  alone,  and  her 
abductor  is  unknown  to  us. 

"  The  son  of  Diti,  Danu,  who,  through  a  curse,  had  been 
forced  to  assume  the  form  of  a  titan,  imparted  the  name  of 
Sugriva,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  to  us.  Now  I  have 
answered  thine  enquiries  fully  in  all  sincerity ;  Rama  and  I 
both  seek  the  help  of  Sugriva.  The  distributor  of  all 
wealth,  he,  who  has  reached  the  peak  of  glory  and  was  formerly 
the  guardian  of  the  worlds,  has  come  to  seek  Sugriva's  protection. 
The  son  of  that  instructor  of  his  people,  who  was  devoted  to 
his  duty,  of  whom  Sita  was  the  daughter-in-law,  Rama,  seeks 
the  protection  of  Sugriva.  The  strong  defender  of  the  whole 
universe,  that  was  formerly  his  highway,  my  Guru  Rama, 
whom  thou  seest  here,  has  come  to  seek  refuge  with  Sugriva. 
He,  under  whose  compassion  all  beings  rest,  Rama,  has  come 
to  appeal  to  the  goodwill  of  that  King  of  the  Monkeys.  It  is 
the  eldest  son  of  King  Dasaratha,  who  was  endowed  with 
every  good  attribute  and  on  this  earth  constantly  showered 
honours  on  monarchs,  Rama,  renowned  in  the  Three  Worlds, 
who  now  seeks  refuge  in  Sugriva,  Lord  of  the  Monkeys. 
Rama,  a  victim  to  grief,  overwhelmed  with  affliction,  has  come 

i76 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

as  a  suppliant !  It  is  for  Sugriva  with  the  leaders  of  the  monkey 
tribes  to  show  favour  to  him." 

Hearing  Lakshrnana,  uttering  this  appeal,  his  tears  flowing 
the  while,  Hanuman  graciously  replied  : — 

"  Such  suppliants,  endowed  with  wisdom,  who  have  mastered 
their  anger  and  other  passions  and  whose  fortune  has  led 
them  to  his  presence,  arc  worthy  to  be  brought  before  that 
Indra  of  Monkeys.  He  too  is  exiled  from  his  kingdom  and 
the  object  of  his  brother's  enmity,  who  has  carried  off  his 
consort  and,  after  maltreating  him  cruelly,  forced  him  to  flee 
trembling  to  the  forest.  That  offspring  of  Surya,  Sugriva, 
will  form  a  pact  of  friendship  with  you,  and  I  shall  accompany 
him  in  his  search  for  Sita." 

Having  spoken  thus  in  a  gentle  and  kindly  tone,  Hanuman 
said  to  Raghava  in  friendly  accents: — "Let  us  seek  out 
Sugriva." 

At  these  words,  the  righteous  Lakshrnana  bowed  courteously 
to  him  and  addressed  the  virtuous  Raghava,  saying : — 

"  What  this  monkey,  born  of  the  Wind-God,  has  gladly 
told  us,  his  master  will  carry  out ;  it  is  here  that  thy  purpose 
will  find  fulfilment,  O  Rama.  Goodness  is  painted  on  his 
countenance ;  he  speaks  cheerfully  and  his  words  ring  true." 
Then  that  extremely  intelligent  son  of  Maruta,  Hanuman, 
went  away,  taking  the  two  heroes,  the  descendants  of  Raghu, 
with  him.  Abandoning  the  guise  of  a  mendicant  and  assum- 
ing the  form  of  a  monkey,  that  great  ape,  taking  those  two 
warriors  on  his  shoulders,  departed. 

Thereafter,  that  intelligent  son  of  Pavana,  who  was  renowned 
among  the  monkeys  and  endowed  with  great  prowess,  delighted 
to  have  accomplished  his  design,  scaled  the  mountain  with 
immense  bounds  taking  Rama  and  Lakshrnana  with  him. 


CHAPTER    5 
The  Alliance  of  Rama  and  Sugriva 

From  the  Rishyamuka  mountain,  Hanuman  bounded  to  the 
Mt.  Malaya  and  presenting  the  two  valiant  descendants  of 
Raghu  to  Sugriva,  said : — 

177 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  This  is  Rama,  O  Great  and  Wise  King,  who  has  come 
here  with  Lakshmana,  his  brother ;  this  true  hero,  born  in  the 
dynasty  of  Ikshwaku,  is  the  son  of  King  Dasaratha. 

"  Fixed  in  his  duty,  he  is  carrying  out  the  behests  of  his 
sire,  that  great  king  who,  gratifying  the  Deity  of  Fire,  Agni, 
with  the  Rajasuya  and  Ashwamedha  sacrifices,  at  those  times 
distributed  hundreds  and  thousands  of  cows  in  charity. 

"  On  account  of  a  woman,  his  son,  Rama,  who  is  present 
here,  was  exiled  to  the  forest  and,  while  that  magnanimous 
hero  was  dwelling  there,  practising  asceticism,  Ravana  carried 
off  his  consort ;  he  now  seeks  thy  protection. 

'*  These  two  brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  solicit  thy 
friendship ;  do  thou  receive  these  heroes,  worthy  of  homage, 
with  honour !  " 

Hearing  these  words  of  Hanuman,  Sugriva,  the  King  of  the 
Monkeys,  who  had  now  become  easy  of  access,  said  to  Rama: — 

"  This  is  a  great  fortune  and  the  greatest  of  gains  for  me 
O  Lord,  that  thou  desirest  to  ally  thyself  in  friendship  with  me, 
who  am  one  of  the  Monkey  Tribe.  Should  that  friendship 
find  favour  with  thee,  then  here  is  my  hand,  take  it  into  thine 
and  let  us  bind  ourselves  fast  with  a  vow." 

Hearing  Sugriva's  sweet  words,  Rama  with  a  joyful  heart 
clasped  his  hand  and,  happy  in  the  thought  of  the  alliance  they 
were  about  to  conclude,  embraced  him  warmly. 

Then  Hanuman,  the  Subduer  of  his  Foes,  who  had  put  off 
his  monk's  guise,  assuming  his  own  shape,  kindled  a  fire  by 
rubbing  two  pieces  of  wood  together.  The  fire  being  lit  and 
flowers  cast  into  it,  thus  preparing  it,  he  placed  it  between 
them,1  full  of  joy  and  devotion. 

Going  round  it  they  both  worshipped  the  fire  and  thus 
Sugriva  and  Rama  were  united  in  friendship.  Whereupon  the 
hearts  of  the  monkey  and  Rama  were  merry  and,  gazing  upon 
each  other,  they  were  unable  to  have  their  fill. 

"  Thou  art  now  the  friend  of  my  heart  in  joy  and  pain ! 
We  are  one !  "  Thus  spoke  Sugriva  in  his  satisfaction,  as  also 
Rama,  and  breaking  off  a  branch  from  a  Sala  tree  adorned  with 
leaves  and  covered  with  flowers,  Sugriva  laid  it  down  as  it 
were  a  carpet  and  with  Rama  sat  down  upon  it,  whilst  the 

1  The  fire  apparently  bciiiR  in  a  brazier. 

i78 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

delighted  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta,  in  his  turn,  offered 
Lakshmana  a  branch  of  blossoming  sandalwood. 

Thereafter,  full  of  happiness,  Sugriva,  his  eyes  wide  with 
delight,  said  to  Rama  in  sweet  and  gentle  tones : — 

"  Cruelly  persecuted,  O  Rama,  I  came  hither  in  great  fear, 
my  consort  having  been  wrested  from  me,  and,  in  deep  distress, 
I  took  refuge  in  this  inaccessible  part  of  the  forest,  where 
I  now  dwell,  my  mind  distracted  with  terror. 

"  My  brother  oppresses  me  and  is  mine  enemy,  O  Rama, 
O  Great  Hero ;  do  thou  deliver  me  from  the  fear  which  Bali 
inspires  in  me !  Act,  O  Kakutstha,  in  such  a  way  that  my 
courage  may  be  restored." 

At  these  words,  the  illustrious  and  virtuous  Rama,  a  lover 
of  justice,  smiling,  answered  Sugriva,  saying : — 

"  I  know  well  that  the  fruit  of  friendship  is  mutual  aid, 
O  Great  Monkey !  I  shall  slay  that  Bali,  who  has  carried  off 
thy  consort !  These  pointed  shafts  that  thou  perceivest,  these 
arrows  bright  as  the  sun,  fly  straight  to  their  target.  Decorated 
with  heron's  feathers  and  resembling  Indra's  thunderbolt, 
skilfully  wrought,  their  points  sharpened,  resembling  provoked 
serpents,  they  will  pierce  that  perverse  wretch  with  force. 
To-day  thou  shalt  see  Bali  fall  on  the  earth  like  a  cleft  mountain 
struck  by  these  pointed  darts,  resembling  venomous  snakes." 

Encouraged  by  Rama's  words,  Sugriva,  overjoyed,  spoke 
again,  saying  : — "  May  I  by  thy  grace,  O  Valiant  Lion  among 
Men,  regain  my  consort  and  my  kingdom.  O  King,  do  thou 
restrain  my  wicked  elder  brother  from  harming  me  hereafter." 

At  the  moment  when  Sugriva  and  Rama  concluded  their 
alliance,  Sita's  left  eye,  resembling  a  lotus,  twitched,1  as  also 
did  that  of  the  Indra  of  Monkeys,  which  resembled  gold,  and 
that  of  the  titan,  Ravana,  which  was  like  a  flame.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    6 

Sugriva  shows  Rama  Sita's  Cloak  and  Jewels 

In  his  joy,  Sugriva  addressed  Raghava,  the  delight  of  the 
House  of  Raghu,  once  again,  saying :  "  I  have  learnt  thine 
history  from  my  servant,  the  best  of  counsellors,  Hanuman, 
and  why  thou  hast  come  to  these  sylvan  solitudes,  where  thou 
residest  with  thy  brother  Lakshmana. 

"  Borne  away  by  a  titan,  thy  consort,  Maithili,  the  daughter 
of  Janaka,  is  grieving  far  from  thee  and  the  sagacious  Lakshmana. 
That  titan  seeking  an  opportunity  to  do  thee  mischief, 
having  slain  the  .vulture,  Jatayu,  carried  off  thy  consort,  thus 
rendering  thee  unhappy.  Thou  shalt  soon  be  freed  from  the 
sorrow  that  the  abduction  of  thy  loved  one  causes  thee. 

"  Whether  she  is  to  be  found  in  heaven  or  hell,  I  shall  seek 
out  that  lady  and  bring  her  back  to  thee,  O  Conqueror  of 
Thine  Enemies !  Know  well,  I  speak  truly,  O  Raghava.  Sita 
is  not  destined  to  be  the  food  of  gods  or  titans ;  thy  consort 
will  prove  to  be  a  poisoned  dish  to  them ! 

"  Banish  thy  grief,  I  will  bring  thy  dear  one  back  to  thee. 
As  I  surmised,  it  was  undoubtedly  Sita  that  I  saw  when  that 
titan  of  cruel  deeds  bore  her  away.  She  was  crying :  '  O 
Rama  !  O  Lakshmana  !  *  in  a  pitiful  voice  and  struggling  in 
Ravana's  arms,  like  the  female  of  the  Serpent  King. 

"  Seeing  me  with  my  five  companions  standing  on  the 
summit  of  the  mountain,  she  dropped  her  cloak  and  magnificent 
jewels,  which  we  collected  and  preserved,  O  Rama.  I  will 
bring  them  to  thee  and  thou  wilt  perchance  be  able  to  call  them 
to  remembrance." 

On  this,  Rama  answered  Sugriva  in  all  affection  and  said: — 
"  Go  quickly  and  bring  them  to  me  here  without  delay,  O 
Friend ! " 

At  these  words,  Sugriva,  intent  on  pleasing  Rama,  ran  in 
all  haste  to  a  deep  cave  in  the  mountain,  and  seizing  the  cloak 
and  jewels,  that  monkey  showed  them  to  Rama,  saying: — 
"  These  are  they,  O  Raghava  !  " 
1 80 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

Then  Rama,  taking  the  raiment  and  the  sparkling  jewels, 
found  his  eyes  to  be  misty  with  tears,  as  the  moon  is  veiled 
in  cloud,  tears  that  in  his  affection  for  Sita  fell  in  torrents, 
and,  losing  his  composure,  he  fell  to  the  earth,  sobbing : 
"  O  My  Dear  One !  " 

Pressing  the  precious  jewels  to  his  breast,  heaving  deep  sighs 
like  the  furious  hissing  of  a  snake  in  its  bole,  his  eyes  streaming 
with  tears,  perceiving  Lakshmana  at  his  side,  he  began  to 
lament  bitterly,  saying : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  behold  Vaidehi's  cloak  and  jewels,  which, 
while  being  carried  away,  she  allowed  to  fall  on  the  earth ; 
without  doubt,  it  was  on  this  grassy  slope  that  Sita,  while 
being  borne  away,  scattered  her  ornaments,  their  condition 
confirms  it." 

Hearing  Rama's  words,  Lakshmana  said : — "  I  do  not 
recognize  the  bracelets  or  earrings,  but  I  know  the  anklets, 
for  I  worshipped  her  feet  alone."1 

Then  Rama  said  to  Sugriva : — "  In  what  place  didst  thou 
behold  Vaidehi,  my  chaste  spouse,  dearer  to  me  than  life 
itself  ?  What  hideous  titan  bore  her  away  ?  Where  does  that 
monster  dwell,  who  has  plunged  me  in  this  mourning  ?  Having 
carried  Sita  away  and  kindled  my  wrath,  he  has  forfeited  his 
life  and  opened  the  portals  of  death.  Say,  who  is  this  titan, 
who,  in  the  forest,  has  by  craft  borne  away  my  tender  consort? 
O  Chief  of  the  Monkeys,  to-day  I  shall  dispatch  him  to  the 
region  of  death." 


CHAPTER    7 

Sugriva  consoles  Rama 

Thus,  in  his  distress,  did  Rama  speak,  and  the  monkey, 
Sugriva,  with  joined  palms,  weeping,  his  voice  shaken  with 
sobs,  answered  him,  saying : — 

"  Indeed  I  do  not  know  where  that  wicked  titan  dwells, 
nor  his  strength,  nor  the  extent  of  his  valour,  nor  the  tribe  to 
which  that  vile  monster  belongs,  but,  O  Subduer  of  Thy  Foes, 
I  beg  thee  in  all  sincerity  to  master  thy  grief. 

1  Implying  that  lie  never  raised  his  eyes  above  her  feet.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI  . 

"  By  mine  efforts,  I  shall  succeed  in  restoring  Maithili  to 
thee !  By  slaying  Ravana  and  his  entire  house  and  mani- 
festing my  personal  courage  to  the  uttermost,  I  shall  act  in 
such  a  way  that  thou  wilt  be  happy  'ere  long.  Thou  hast 
yielded  to  despair  sufficiently,  now  exhibit  thy  native  resolution! 
Men  like  thee  should  not  give  way  to  despondency ! 

"  I  too  suffer  greatly  on  account  of  separation  from  my 
consort,  but  I  do  not  despair  like  thee,  nor  have  I  lost  courage. 
Though  but  a  common  monkey,  I  do  not  indulge  in  complaint. 
How  much  less  shouldst  thou  do  so,  O  Magnanimous  Hero, 
thou  who  art  wise,  valiant  and  illustrious  ! 

"  Thou  shouldst  resolutely  restrain  the  tears  that  fall .;  it 
becometh  thee  not  to  lose  patience,  that  quality  that  distin- 
guishes men  of  nobility. 

"  A  brave  man  has  recourse  to  reason  and  does  not  allow 
himself  to  be  moved  either  in  adversity,  consequent  on  separa- 
tion from  relatives,  or  on  the  loss  of  possessions,  or  at  the 
time  of  death.  But  the  man  who  is  lacking  in  courage  and 
gives  way  to  despair  inevitably  succumbs  to  bis  grief,  like  an 
overloaded  ship  in  the  water. 

"  Bowing  low  before  thee  with  joined  palms,  I  beseech  thee 
to  summon  up  all  thy  fortitude  and  not  yield  to  misery.  Those 
who  permit  themselves  to  be  overcome  by  grief  never  succeed, 
and  their  strength  is  decreased ;  do  not  therefore  give  thyself 
up  to  sorrow. 

"  He  who  is  overwhelmed  by  despair  is  in  danger.  Banish 
thy  sorrow,  O  Indra  among  Men,  and  revive  thy  courage; 
let  it  be  fully  restored  !  I  speak  to  thee  for  thine  own  good, 
as  a  friend;  I  do  not  wish  to  instruct  thee.  Therefore  for  our 
friendship's  sake,  do  not  yield  thyself  up  to  grief." 

Tenderly  consoled  by  Sugriva,  Rama  wiped  his  face,  which 
was  wet  with  tears,  with  the  corner  of  bis  tunic  and,  returning 
to  his  normal  state  as  a  result  of  Sugriva's  words,  the  Lord 
Kakutstha,  embracing  him,  said  : — 

"  O  Sugriva,  thou  dost  fulfil  the  role  of  a  devoted  friend, 
that  of  being  of  service  with  dignity.  O  Friend,  see  how, 
through  thy  good  counsel,  I  have  become  myself  again.  It  is 
not  easy  to  find  such  an  ally,  who  is  suffering  the  same  adversity; 
therefore  exert  thyself  to  find  Maithili  and  the  cruel  titan, 
182 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

that  perverse  Ravana,  and  tell  me  frankly  what  I  should  do. 
Thou  art  a  rich  field  that  the  rains  have  visited ;  everything 
will  succeed  with  thee.  Further,  the  words  I  recently  pro- 
nounced1 with  confidence,  O  Tiger  among  Monkeys,  will 
without  doubt  come  to  pass.  Never  have  I  uttered  a  falsehood, 
nor  shall  I  ever  do  so.  I  swear  by  the  truth,  that  what  I  have 
said  will  come  to  pass  1 " 

Hearing  the  words  of  that  King  of  Men,  the  wise  leader  of 
the  valiant  monkeys  felt  in  his  heart  that  his  purpose  was 
accomplished. 


CHAPTER     8 

Sugriva  implores  Rama  to  kelp  him  against  Bali 

Gratified  on  hearing  these  words,  Sugriva  joyfully  addressed 
the  elder  brother  of  Lakshmana  in  this  wise : — 

"  Undoubtedly  I  am  favoured  by  the  Gods,  since  I  have  a 
virtuous  friend,  full  of  great  qualities,  such  as  thou !  With 
thy  help,  O  Irreproachable  One,  it  would  be  possible  for  me 
even  to  conquer  the  celestial  realm,  how  much  more  regain 
my  kingdom,  O  Lord !  I  am  the  object  of  reverence  to  my 
friends  and  kinsmen,  O  Rama,  since,  witnessed  by  the  sacred 
fire,  I  have  formed  an  alliance  with  thee !  O  Descendant  of 
the  House  of  Raghu,  thou  wilt  soon  find  me  worthy  of  thy 
friendship,  but  it  does  not  become  me  to  speak  of  mine  own 
good  qualities.  It  is  in  great  heroes  such  as  thou,  masters 
of  themselves,  that  affection,  like  true  courage,  remains  fixed, 
O  Best  of  Well-bora  Men !  Silver,  gold  and  precious  gems 
are  shared  amongst  friends  as  belonging  to  either;  rich  or 
poor,  happy  or  wretched,  destitute  or  gifted  with  good  qualities, 
a  friend  is  ever  a  friend.  Good  fortune,  prosperity  or  country, 
O  Irreproachable  Hero,  are  all  sacrificed  for  the  sake  of  a 
friend ;  only  devotion  to  him  matters." 

"  True  indeed,"  replied  the  blessed  Rama  to  the  handsome 
Sugriva,  in  the  presence  of  Lakshmana,  who  equalled  Vasava 
in  wisdom. 

1  Concerning  Bali. 

183 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

The  following  day,  Sugriva,  seeing  Rama  standing  by  the 
valiant  Lakshmana,  scanned  the  forest  hurriedly  and,  observing 
a  Sala  tree  at  no  great  distance,  covered  with  flowers  and  heavy 
with  luxuriant  foliage,  in  which  bees  were  humming,  tore  off 
a  magnificent  leafy  branch,  and  spreading  it  on  the  ground 
sat  down  on  it  with  Rama. 

Seeing  the  two  thus  installed,  Hanuman,  in  his  turn,  break- 
ing off  a  branch  of  a  Sala  tree,  invited  the  self-effacing  Lakshmana 
to  take  his  place  there. 

Beholding  Rama  seated  at  his  ease  on  that  lofty  mountain, 
covered  with  flowering  Sala  trees,  radiating  serenity  like  a 
peaceful  lake,  Sugriva,  in  his  delight,  in  soft  and  gentle  tones, 
leaning  towards  his  friend  who  was  manifesting  extreme 
joy,  said  to  him  in  accents  trembling  with  emotion : — 

"  Harassed  by  my  brother,  my  declared  enemy,  O  Rama, 
fear  of  Bali  preys  on  my  mind.  O  Thou  who  art  the  refuge 
of  the  world,  I  am  without  a  defender,  grant  me  thy  support  !  " 

Hearing  these  words,  the  illustrious  and  virtuous  Rama, 
fixed  in  his  duty,  smiling,  answered  Sugriva,  saying : — 

"Administering  relief  is  the  fruit  of  friendship,  harming 
others  that  of  enmity !  This  very  day,  I  shall  slay  the  abductor 
of  thy  consort.  Here  are  my  winged  shafts  and  fiery  arrows, 
O  Fortunate  One,  whose  hafts,  inlaid  with  gold,  resembling 
Mahendra's  thunder-bolt,  have  come  from  the  forest  of 
Karttikeya  and  are  adorned  with  heron's  plumes.  Their 
smooth  joints  and  sharp  points  lend  them  the  appearance  of 
angry  snakes.  Thou  shalt  see  that  enemy,  thy  brother  called 
Bali,  tainted  with  evil  deeds,  struck  down  with  these  arrows, 
like  a  mountain  crumbling  into  dust." 

Hearing  Rama's  words,  Sugriva,  the  leader  of  the  monkey 
army,  felt  an  inexpressible  joy.  "  Excellent !  Excellent !  ", 
he  cried.  "  O  Rama,  I  have  been  overwhelmed  with  distress 
and  thou  art  the  refuge  of  the  afflicted.  Knowing  thee  to  be 
mine  ally,  I  have  poured  out  my  sorrow  on  thy  breast.  Having 
clasped  thy  hand  in  mine,  witnessed  by  the  fire,  thou  hast 
become  the  most  valued  friend  of  my  life ;  by  the  truth  I 
swear  it.  I  have  taken  thee  as  my  friend  and  speak  to  thee  in 
confidence.  The  misfortune  that  has  overtaken  me  constantly 
gnaws  at  my  heart." 

184 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

Thus  spoke  Sugriva,  his  eyes  brimming,  his  voice  strangled 
with  sobs,  unable  to  continue.  Then,  stemming  the  stream  of 
his  tears,  that  flowed  like  a  raging  torrent,  Sugriva,  in  Rama's 
presence,  mastering  himself  in  an  instant  and,  stifling  his  sobs, 
wiped  his  beautiful  eyes.  Thereafter,  that  illustrious  monkey 
once  again  addressed  Raghava,  saying : — 

"  O  Rama,  formerly  Bali,  overwhelming  me  with  insults, 
banished  me  from  the  kingdom.  Seizing  my  consort,  dearer 
to  me  than  life  itself,  he  bound  my  friends  in  chains.  Then  that 
perverse  wretch  sought  to  destroy  me,  O  Rama,  and  often  the 
monkeys  themselves  were  bribed  to  that  end,  but  I  slew  them. 
Full  of  apprehension  on  seeing  thee,  O  Rama,  I  did  not  venture 
to  go  out  to  meet  thee,  being  a  prey  to  fear  and  yet  in  dread. 

"  These  monkeys  with  Hanuman  as  their  leader  are  my  sole 
companions  ;  it  is  due  to  them  that  I  am  still  alive,  though  the 
situation  is  grave.  These  loyal  monkeys  surround  and  protect 
me,  accompanying  me  on  all  my  journeys,  remaining  with  me 
wherever  I  decide  to  stay. 

"  O  Rama,  of  what  use  is  it  to  speak  further  ?  My  elder 
brother,  Bali,  distinguished  for  his  cruelty,  is  mine  adversary. 
If  he  dies,  at  that  very  moment  my  misfortunes  will  be  at  an 
end.  My  happiness,  nay,  my  very  life,  depends  on  his  destruc- 
tion. This  is  the  only  remedy  for  my  woes.  I  tell  thee  this 
while  yet  overcome  with  grief;  happy  or  unhappy,  a  friend 
is  ever  the  refuge  of  a  friend  !  " 

At  these  words,  Rama  enquired  of  Sugriva,  saying : — "  I 
wish  to  know  the  source  of  this  hostility,  tell  me  the  cause  of 
your  mutual  enmity.  When  the  reason  for  thine  hatred  is 
known  to  me,  O  Monkey,  I  will  concern  myself  with  thy  relief. 
I  shall  reflect  carefully  on  the  matter  and  on  its  strength  and 
weakness.  Great  is  mine  indignation  to  learn  of  thine  ill- 
treatment,  my  heart  beats  faster,  as  in  the  rainy  season  the 
river's  flow  is  augmented.  Speak  with  serene  confidence  while 
I  string  my  bow,  and  know  that  when  I  loose  my  shaft  to 
strike  thine  adversary,  he  is  already  slain." 

Hearing  the  speech  of  the  magnanimous  Kakutstha,  Sugriva 
and  his  counsellors  were  highly  gratified,  and  with  a  cheerful 
countenance  Sugriva  began  to  relate  the  real  cause  of  his 
enmity  with  Bali  to  the  elder  brother  of  Lakshmana. 
185 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER    9 

The  Story  of  Bali  and  Mayavi 

"  Bah  is  the  name  of  my  elder  brother,  the  Scourge  of  his 
Foes.  He  was  ever  held  in  great  esteem  by  my  father  and  mother, 
and  I,  also,  loved  him.  When  his  father  died,  he  being  the 
elder,  the  ministers,  who  thought  highly  of  him,  installed  him 
as  King  of  the  Monkeys.  During  his  rule  over  that  immense 
empire  of  his  ancestors,  I  lived  in  constant  subjection  to  him, 
as  one  of  his  servants.  On  account  of  a  woman,  a  great  quarrel 
arose  between  Mayavi,  the  illustrious  elder  son  of  Dundubhi 
and  Bali.  One  night,  whilst  others  slept,  Mayavi  approached 
the  gates  of  Kishkindha,  roaring  with  anger  and  challenged 
Bah  to  fight.  Roused  from  deep  sleep  by  those  formidable 
cries,  my  brother,  unable  to  contain  himself,  went  forth  immedi- 
ately, advancing  in  fury  on  that  powerful  titan  in  order  to  kill 
him.  His  wives  and  I  tried  to  restrain  him  and  I  threw 
myself  at  his  feet,  but  he  repelled  us  all  and  went  forth  full  of 
valour. 

"Then,  out  of  devotion,  I  followed  him.  Seeing  my  brother 
and  me  following  within  a  short  distance,  the  titan,  in  fear,  fled 
in  all  haste.  Struck  with  terror  he  ran  on,  but  we  ran  even 
faster.  The  moon,  that  had  risen,  flooded  the  path  with  its 
light.  Hidden  by  grass,  a  large  hole  in  the  ground  came  into 
view  and  the  titan  threw  himself  into  it  precipitately.  We 
reached  the  edge  and  halted.  Bali,  who  was  overcome  with 
rage,  his  senses  perturbed,  said  to  me : — 

" '  O  Sugriva,  remain  here,  without  leaving  the  mouth  of  the 

cave,  while  I  enter  in  order  to  engage  the  enemy  and  slay  him!  * 

"  Hearing  these  words  I  besought  that  Destroyer  of  his  Foes 

to  go  no  further  but  he,  under  the  threat  of  a  curse,  told  me 

not  to  move  from  there  and  disappeared  into  the  cavern. 

'*  After  his  entry  into  the  cave,  a  whole  year  elapsed  and  I 

remained  at  my  post  without ;  I  imagined  him  to  be  dead  and 

186 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

in  my  affection  for  him  was  deeply  distressed  and  a  prey  to 
fearful  presentiments,  reflecting :  '  I  shall  not  see  my  brother 
again.' 

"  Then,  for  a  long  time,  blood  mixed  with  foam  flowed  from 
the  cave  and  the  roaring  of  the  titan  reached  my  ears,  but  I 
did  not  hear  the  cries  of  triumph  that  my  elder  brother  emitted 
in  the  struggle.  Thereafter  on  account  of  the  various  signs, 
I  went  away,  thinking  that  my  brother  was  dead,  but  first 
I  blocked  up  the  mouth  of  the  cave  with  a  rock  as  large  as  a 
mountain.  O  My  Friend,  overcome  by  sorrow,  I  offered  up 
the  ceremonial  water  for  my  brother  and  returned  to  Kishkindha. 

"  Despite  mine  efforts  to  keep  the  matter  secret,  the  ministers 
learnt  of  it  and  having  taken  counsel  together,  they  installed 
me  as  sovereign.  I  ruled  the  empire  with  justice,  O  Rama. 
In  the  meantime  Bali,  having  slain  his  enemy,  the  titan,  returned. 
Seeing  me  installed  with  all  the  insignia  of  royalty,  his  eyes 
became  red  with  anger  and  he  overwhelmed  me  with  reproaches 
and  bound  my  ministers  in  chains. 

"  Having  slain  his  adversary,  my  brother  returned  to  the  city, 
and  I,  paying  obeisance  to  that  great  warrior,  offered  him  the 
traditional  homage,  but  he  did  not  respond  to  my  cordial 
congratulations.  I  touched  his  feet  with  my  forehead,  O  Lord, 
but  Bah  in  his  anger  relused  to  pardon  me." 


CHAPTER    10 

The  Origin  of  Bali's  Hatred  of  Sugriva 

"  In  my  desire  to  make  peace,  I  tried  to  placate  my  brother, 
who,  returning,  was  incensed  against  me. 

"  I  said :  *  By  the  grace  of  the  Gods,  thou  art  victorious 
and  thine  enemy  has  fallen  under  thy  blows ;  without  thee, 
I  should  be  bereft  of  support,  thou  art  my  only  defender,  O  My 
Protector,  My  Delight!  Now  accept  this  royal  canopy  of 
many  supports,  resembling  the  full  moon  about  to  rise.  Take 
also  these  chanwaras  from  my  hands ! 

" '  O  King !  For  a  whole  year  I  waited  sadly  beside  the 
cave  and,  seeing  blood  flowing  to  the  entrance  and  stopping 
187 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

there,  my  heart  was  filled  with  anguish  and  my  mind  deeply 
troubled.  I  then  closed  the  opening  of  the  cavern  with  a 
great  rock  and  left  that  place  to  return  to  Kishkindha  in  deep 
distress.  Seeing  me,  the  people  of  that  city  and  the  ministers 
also  placed  me  on  the  throne,  without  my  desiring  it.  There- 
fore pardon  me,  thou  who  art  our  Sovereign.  I  was  invested 
with  royal  dignity  in  thine  absence  and  thus  preserved  the  city, 
its  ministers  and  inhabitants,  from  anarchy.  This  kingdom 
has  been  as  a  trust  to  me;  I  now  render  it  back  to  thee,  O 
Friend.  Do  not  be  wrath  against  me,  O  Destroyer  of  thy 
Foes  !  Placing  my  head  at  thy  feet,  O  King,  with  joined  palms, 
I  appeal  to  thee.  It  was  on  the  insistence  of  the  ministers 
and  the  united  populace,  that  I  was  placed  on  the  throne, 
they  reflecting  that  the  country  would  be  seized  by  an  enemy 
in  the  absence  of  a  monarch.' 

"  To  this  humble  speech,  Bali  answered  with  invectives, 
saying : — '  Cursed  be  thou  ! '  and  repeated  the  imprecation. 
Then,  gathering  his  subjects  and  ministers  together,  he  in- 
veighed against  me,  in  the  midst  of  my  friends,  reproaching 
me  with  bitter  words,  saying  : — 

" '  Know  well,  that  in  anger  the  great  Titan,  Mayavi, 
one  night  challenged  me  to  a  long-desired  combat.  Hearing 
his  voice,  I  left  my  royal  dwelling  and  was  followed  immedi- 
ately by  my  unscrupulous  brother,  who  is  present  here.  In 
the  night,  seeing  me  followed  by  another,  that  great  titan  fled 
terrified  and  both  of  us  pursued  him  closely.  In  his  haste  to 
escape,  he  entered  a  great  cave,  and,  seeing  that  vast  and 
fearful  cavern,  I  said  to  my  false-hearted  brother :  *  I  cannot 
return  to  the  city  till  I  have  slain  my  rival ;  do  thou  wait 
at  the  mouth  of  the  pit  till.  I  have  struck  him  down/  In  the 
belief  that  he  would  remain  there,  I  penetrated  into  that 
inaccessible  cave. 

" '  While  I  was  pursuing  mine  enemy,  whose  audacity 
rendered  him  truly  formidable,  a  whole  year  elapsed,  but  at 
last  I  discovered  him  and  slew  him  with  his  entire  family. 
That  titan,  while  being  slain,  roared  aloud,  and  a  stream  of 
blood  that  spread  all  round,  filled  the  cave,  making  it  difficult 
to  pass.  Having  happily  slain  my  cruel  adversary,  I  could 
not  find  the  opening  of  the  cave,  the  entrance  having  been 
1 88 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

closed.  I  called  Sugriva  again  and  again  but  there  was  no 
response  and  my  situation  was  serious.  By  dint  of  kicking, 
I  was  able  to  roll  back  the  rock  and  emerged,  after  which  I 
returned  to  the  city.  That  is  why  I  am  incensed  against  the 
wicked  Sugriva,  whose  desire  for  the  throne  overcame  his 
brotherly  affection.* 

*'  With  these  words,  the  monkey  Bali,  bereft  of  all  sense  of 
shame,  chased  me  from  the  kingdom  with  but  a  single  garment, 
having  ill-treated  me  and  carried  off  my  consort,  O  Rama. 
Wretched  and  deprived  of  my  companions,  I  took  refuge  on 
this  lofty  mountain,  Rishyamuka,  to  which,  for  a  particular 
reason,  Bali  has  no  access.  This  is  the  whole  story  of  the  origin 
of  our  intense  hostility ;  I  have  not  merited  the  great  humilia- 
tion that  has  visited  me,  as  thou  now  seest,  O  Raghava.  O 
Thou  who  art  the  dispeller  of  fear,  do  thou  take  this  dread  of 
my  brother  from  me  and  punish  him  in  my  name." 

The  virtuous  prince,  having  heard  the  faithful  Sugriva's 
narrative,  smiling,  answered  him  saying : — 

"  These  arrows  of  mine,  bright  as  the  sun,  never  fail  to 
reach  their  target  and  with  their  sharp  points  will  strike  down 
that  evil  Bali  with  force.  As  long  as  I  do  not  behold  this 
ravisher  of  thy  consort,  this  wretch  of  perverse  practices  will 
live,  but  not  an  instant  longer. 

"  I  see  thee  to  be  plunged  in  an  ocean  of  grief,  as  am  I, 
and  I  shall  aid  thee  to  traverse  it ;  thou  shalt  certainly  regain 
thine  erstwhile  prosperity." 

Hearing  these  words,  that  increased  his  joy  and  courage, 
Sugriva,  in  extreme  delight,  uttered  the  following  memorable 
words. 


CHAPTER     I  I 

Sugriva  tells  Rama  of  Bali's  Exploits 

Having  listened  to  Rama's  words,  which  inspired  him  with 
joy  and  courage,  Sugriva  paid  obeisance  to  him,  manifesting 
his  gratitude,  and  said : — "  In  thy  wrath,  undoubtedly,  thou  art 

189 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

able  to  burn  up  the  worlds  with  thy  sharp  arrows,  like  the  fire 
at  the  end  of  the  great  cycle ;  yet  reflect  on  the  courage  of 
Bali  and,  having  heard  me  with  attention,  consider  what  should 
be  done. 

"  'Ere  the  sun  rises,  the  indefatigable  Bali  strides  from 
the  western  to  the  eastern  ocean  and  from  the  northern  to 
the  southern  sea.  He  is  so  powerful  that  he  is  able  to  break 
off  the  lofty  mountain  peaks,  throwing  them  into  the  air  and 
catching  them  again.  In  order  to  demonstrate  his  strength, 
he  will  snap  in  two  innumerable  trees  of  every  kind  in  the  forest. 
"  Once,  there  existed  a  giant,  named  Dundubhi,  in  the  form 
of  a  buffalo,  who  resembled  the  peak  of  Mt.  Kailasha  and  who 
was  as  strong  as  a  thousand  elephants.  The  thought  of  his 
own  might  intoxicated  him  and  he  was  puffed  up  with  pride 
on  account  of  the  boons  he  had  received. 

"  That  giant  came  to  the  sea,  the  Lord  of  Rivers,  and 
approached  that  ocean  of  tumultuous  waves,  rich  in  pearls, 
saying ; — (  Let  us  enter  into  combat  one  with  the  other !  * 
But  that  righteous  Lord  of  the  Waters,  rising  up  in  all  his 
majesty,  answered  that  titan  who  was  driven  on  by  destiny, 
saving : — '  O  Skilful  Warrior,  I  am  not  able  to  take  up  thy 
challenge,  but  hear  and  I  will  tell  thee  of  one  who  can  match 
thee  in  fight. 

" '  On  a  vast  plain,  the  retreat  of  the  ascetics,  there  lives  a 
monarch  of  the  mountains,  named  Himavat,  the  far-famed 
father-in-law  of  Shiva.  He  possesses  great  rivers,  many 
ravines  and  waterfalls  and  is  well  able  to  satisfy  thine  over- 
whelming lust  for  combat.'  Reflecting :  *  The  ocean  holds 
me  in  dread',  that  foremost  of  titans  sped  to  the  forest  of 
Himavat,  as  swift  as  an  arrow  loosed  from  a  bow. 

"  Breaking  off  the  great  white  cliffs,  Dundubhi  let  them  roll 
down,  shouting  with  exultation.  Then,  like  a  mass  of  white 
cloud,  Himavat  of  gentle  and  benign  aspect,  standing  on  the 
summit  of  the  mountain,  addressed  that  titan  thus : — '  Do  not 
torment  me,  O  Dundubhi,  O  Thou  who  delightest  in  justice ! 
I  am  not  concerned  with  the  exploits  of  warriors  but  am  a 
refuge  of  the  ascetics.* 

"  Hearing  these  words  of  that  righteous  monarch  of  the 
mountains,  Dundubhi,  his  eyes  red  with  anger,  answered : — 
190 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

" ■  If  thou  hast  not  the  strength  to  fight  and  art  paralysed 
with  fear,  then  tell  me  who  is  able  to  match  his  prowess  with 
mine,  for  I  wish  to  enter  into  combat  with  him.' 

"  Hearing  this,  the  wise  Himavat,  skilful  in  discourse, 
answered  that  powerful  titan  to  whom  he  had  spoken  previously, 
saying : — 

"  '  The  name  of  that  hero  of  great  intelligence,  who  dwells 
in  Kishkindha,  is  Bah,  the  illustrious  son  of  Shakra.  That 
great  sage  is  a  skilful  warrior  and  of  thy  stature,  he  is  as  well 
able  to  enter  into  combat  with  thee  as  Vasava  with  Namuchi. 
Go  with  all  speed  and  seek  him  out,  since  thou  art  thirsting 
to  fight;  he  has  little  patience  and  is  ever  full  of  martial 
ardour.' 

"  Having  listened  to  the  words  of  Himavat,  Dundubhi  in 
fury  went  to  Kishkindha,  Bali's  city,  and  assuming  the  form 
of  a  terrible  buffalo  with  pointed  horns,  resembling  a  thunder- 
cloud charged  with  rain  in  the  sky,  that  powerful  titan  came 
to  the  gates  of  the  capital.  Causing  the  earth  to  tremble  with 
his  cries,  he  uprooted  the  trees  near  the  entrance  of  the  city, 
snapping  them  in  two.  Then,  like  an  elephant,  he  burst  open 
the  gates. 

"  My  brother,  who  was  in  the  inner  apartments,  hearing 
the  tumult,  came  out,  full  of  impatience,  surrounded  by  his 
wives,  like  the  moon  encircled  with  stars,  and  that  leader  of  the 
monkeys,  Bali,  said  to  Dundubhi  in  clear  and  measured 
accents : — 

"  '  O  Dundubhi,  why  dost  thou  obstruct  the  gateway  of  the 
city  and  bellow  thus  ?  I  know  who  thou  art.  Have  a  care 
for  thy  life,  O  Warrior ! * 

"  At  these  words  of  the  sagacious  King  of  the  Monkeys, 
Dundubhi,  his  eyes  red  with  anger,  answered  : — 

"  *  Do  not  address  me  thus  in  the  presence  of  women,  O 
Warrior  !  Accept  my  challenge  and  meet  me  in  combat  to-day, 
so  that  I  can  measure  thy  strength,  though,  O  Monkey,  I  am 
willing  to  restrain  my  wrath  for  one  night,  to  allow  thee  to 
indulge  in  the  pleasures  of  love,  according  to  thy  whim,  till 
the  rising  of  the  sun.  Distribute  alms,  therefore,  to  thy 
monkeys  and  embrace  them  for  the  last  time.  Thou  an  the 
King  of  the  Deer  of  the  Trees,  do  thou  load  thy  friends  and 
191 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

people  with  favours.  Look  long  on  Kishkindha ;  enjoy  the 
company  of  thy  wives,  for  I  am  about  to  chastise  thee  for 
thine  insolence.  To  slay  a  drunken  man  or  one  who  is 
demented  or  whose  strength  has  ebbed  away  or  who  is  without 
weapons  or  defence,  or  one,  like  thee,  given  over  to  lust,  is 
considered  equal  to  infanticide  in  the  world.' 

"  Dismissing  all  his  wives,  including  Tara  and  others,  my 
brother,  restraining  his  wrath,  smiling,  answered  that  chief 
of  the  titans,  saying  : — 

"  '  Do  not  make  a  pretext  of  my  being  inebriated  if  thou  art 
not  afraid  to  enter  into  combat  with  me !  Know  that  in  the 
present  issue  this  intoxication  is  the  wine  of  warriors  !  * 

"  With  these  words  he  threw  off  the  golden  chain  that  his 
sire,  Mahendra,  had  given  him  and  began  to  fight.  Seizing 
Dundubhi  by  the  horns,  who  resembled  a  mountain,  that 
elephant  among  monkeys  roared  aloud  and  began  to  assail 
him  with  blows.  Thereafter  Bali  with  a  tremendous  shout 
threw  him  on  the  ground  and  blood  began  to  flow  from  the 
stricken  buffalo. 

"  Then  betwixt  the  two  combatants,  Bah  and  Dundubhi, 
mad  with  anger,  each  desirous  of  overcoming  the  other,  a 
terrible  struggle  ensued.  My  brother  fought  with  matchless 
courage,  equal  to  Indra's,  dealing  blows  with  his  fists,  knees, 
feet  and  also  with  rocks  and  trees.  The  duel  between  the 
monkey  and  the  titan  caused  the  latter  to  weaken,  whilst  the 
strength  of  the  former  grew.  In  the  end,  Bah,  lifting  Dundubhi 
up,  let  him  fall  on  the  earth  and  in  this  death  struggle  the 
giant  perished. 

"  As  he  fell  blood  flowed  in  rivers  from  the  veins  of  his 
body  and  that  titan  of  vast  limbs  lay  stretched  on  the  ground, 
having  rejoined  the  elements. 

"  Lifting  up  the  inanimate  corpse  in  his  two  arms,  Bali 
with  one  throw  sent  it  flying  to  a  distance  of  four  miles.  From 
the  titan's  jaws,  shattered  by  the  violence  of  the  fall,  blood 
spouted  forth  and  the  drops  were  carried  by  the  wind  to 
Matanga's  hermitage.  Seeing  that  rain  of  blood,  the  Sage, 
displeased,  reflected  :  '  What  perverse  wretch  has  dared  to 
spatter  me  with  blood  ?  Who  is  this  evil,  perfidious  and  vile 
creature,  this  madman  ? ' 

192 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

"  Thinking  thus,  that  excellent  Muni  went  out  of  the  her- 
mitage and  beheld  the  buffalo,  as  large  as  a  mountain,  lying 
dead  on  the  ground.  By  virtue  of  his  austerities,  he  knew  that 
a  monkey  was  responsible  for  this  deed  and  he  pronounced  a 
terrible  curse  on  that  ape  who  had  thrown  the  corpse  there  saying: — 

"  '  May  he  never  come  here !  If  that  monkey  who,  with  a 
stream  of  blood,  has  desecrated  this  wood  where  I  have  built 
my  retreat,  ever  sets  foot  in  this  place,  he  will  die !  Should 
that  wicked  wretch  who  has  thrown  the  corpse  of  this  titan 
here,  breaking  my  trees,  come  within  four  miles  of  my  hermitage, 
he  shall  assuredly  not  survive  and  his  confederates,  whosoever 
they  may  be,  who  have  sought  refuge  in  my  forest,  will  not  be 
permitted  to  remain  here  following  this  malediction.  Let 
them  go  where  they  will,  for  I  shall  assuredly  curse  any  who 
stay  in  these  woods,  that  I  have  protected  like  mine  own  off- 
spring, and  destroy  the  foliage  and  young  shoots,  plucking  the 
fruit  and  scratching  up  the  roots.  From  to-day,  every 
monkey  that  I  see  here  will  be  changed  into  stone  for  the 
period  of  a  thousand  years  !  * 

"  On  hearing  the  words  of  the  ascetic,  all  the  monkeys  that 
frequented  those  woods  went  away,  and,  beholding  diem 
issuing  from  the  forest,  Bah  enquired  of  them,  saying : — 

" '  Why  have  ye  all  come  here,  ye  dwellers  in  the  Matanga 
Forest  ?   Happy  are  they  who  dwell  in  the  woods  ! ' 

"  Then  those  monkeys  told  Bali,  who  wore  a  chain  of  gold, 
the  cause  of  their  departure  and  also  of  the  curse  that  had  been 
laid  on  them. 

"  My  brother,  hearing  the  monkeys*  words,  sought  out  that 
great  Rishi  and  with  joined  palms  attempted  to  appease  him, 
but  Matanga  refused  to  listen  to  him  and  re-entered  his 
hermitage. 

"  Trembling  under  the  shadow  of  that  curse,  Bali  began  to 
roam  about  aimlessly,  but,  terrified  of  the  malediction,  that 
monkey  did  not  dare  approach  the  great  mountain  Rishyamuka 
or  even  glance  in  that  direction,  O  Prince. 

"  Knowing  he  will  never  venture  here,  O  Rama,  I  wander 

about  these  woods  with  my  companions,  free  of  all  anxiety 

The  heaped  bones  of  Dundubhi,  the  victim  of  the  arrogance, 

his  strength  inspired  in  him,  are  here  and  resemble  the  peak 

193 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  a  vast  mountain.  Bali  in  his  might,  stripped  all  the  leaves 
from  these  seven  giant  Sala  trees  with  their  mighty  boughs, 
one  after  the  other.  His  strength  is  immeasurable,  O  Rama ; 
I  have  now  proved  it  to  thee.  In  consequence,  I  do  not  see 
how  thou  canst  overcome  him  in  battle,  O  King." 

Thus  spoke  Sugriva  and  Lakshmana,  smiling,  then  enquired 
of  him : — 

"  What  can  Rama  do  to  convince  thee  that  he  is  able  to 
overcome  him  ?  "  Sugriva  then  made  answer  : — 

"  If  Rama  is  able  to  penetrate  these  seven  Sala  trees,  that 
Bali  pierced  again  and  again,  with  a  single  arrow,  then,  by  that 
sign,  I  shall  know  he  can  overcome  him.  At  the  same  time, 
let  him  with  a  single  kick  send  the  carcase  of  the  buffalo  flying 
to  a  distance  of  a  hundred  bows'  length." 

Having  spoken,  Sugriva,  the  corners  of  whose  eyes  were 
slightly  red,  reflected  awhile  and  then  once  more  addressed 
Rama,  the  descendant  of  Kakutstha,  saying  : — 

"  Full  of  courage  and  audacity,  renowned  for  his  strength 
and  energy,  that  powerful  monkey  has  never  been  defeated 
in  combat.  His  exploits  are  famous ;  the  Gods  themselves 
are  not  able  to  accomplish  them.  It  was  on  remembering 
them,  filled  with  terror,  that  I  resolved  to  take  refuge  on  the 
Rishyamuka  Mountain.  Thinking  of  that  Indra  among 
Monkeys  and  how  invincible,  irresistible  and  ruthless  he  is, 
I  came  here.  Filled  with  distress  and  anguish,  I  wander  about 
in  these  woods  with  my  devoted  and  excellent  companions, 
Hanuman  and  others.  Thou  art  for  me  a  glorious  and  illus- 
trious friend,  O  Thou  who  art  dear  to  thy  friends,  O  Lion 
among  Men  !  I  take  refuge  with  thee  as  in  another  Himavat ; 
yet  I  am  conversant  with  the  strength  of  my  wicked  brother  and 
his  overbearing  nature  and  I  am  not  acquainted  with  thy  skill 
as  a  warrior,  O  Raghava.  Assuredly,  it  is  not  that  I  wish  to 
test  thee  or  humiliate  thee  nor  inspire  thee  with  fear  by  re- 
counting his  great  exploits.  Mine  own  cowardice  is  well 
known !  O  Rama,  thine  accents,  thine  assurance,  thy  temerity 
and  thy  stature  truly  manifest  thy  great  power,  which  is  like 
a  fire  concealed  beneath  the  ashes." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  magnanimous   Sugriva,   Rama 
began  to  smile  and  answered  him,  saying : — 
194 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

"  If  thou  dost  not  trust  in  our  courage,  O  Monkey,  I  will 
instil  thee  with  that  confidence  so  essential  in  war." 

Then  with  his  foot,  that  mighty  hero  sent  the  dried  up 
carcase  of  that  titan  flying.  Seeing  the  carcase  hurtling  through 
the  air,  Sugriva  once  more  addressed  Rama,  who  was  as 
radiant  as  the  sun,  in  the  presence  of  Lakshmana  and  the 
monkeys  and  in  candid  accents  said  : — 

"  O  my  Friend,  when  that  corpse  was  fresh  and  its  flesh 
intact,  it  was  sent  flying  through  the  air  by  my  brother,  though 
he  was  weakened  by  inebriation  and  fatigue.  Now  stripped 
of  flesh,  as  light  as  a  straw,  thou  hast  kicked  it  in  play;  it  is 
therefore  impossible  for  me  to  judge  who  is  the  more  powerful, 
thou  or  Bali.  Between  a  fresh  corpse  and  dry  bones,  there  is 
a  great  difference,  O  Raghava. 

"I  am  therefore  still  uncertain,  My  Dear  Friend,  as  to  who 
is  the  stronger,  thou  or  Bali,  but  if  thou  art  able  to  pierce  even 
a  single  Sala  tree,  then  I  should  be  able  to  judge  who  is  superior 
and  who  inferior.  Therefore  stretch  that  bow,  which  re- 
sembles the  trunk  of  an  elephant  and  drawing  the  cord  up  to 
thine  ear,  discharge  that  great  arrow,  which  I  am  sure  will 
penetrate  the  Sala  tree  and  by  that  sign  I  shall  be  satisfied. 
I  implore  thee,  O  Prince,  to  do  me  this  great  favour.  As 
amongst  the  planets  the  sun  is  greatest  and  among  mountains 
the  Himalayas,  just  as  among  quadrupeds  the  lion  is  king, 
so  among  men  thou  art  supreme  in  valour." 


CHAPTER     12 

The  Fight  between  Sugriva  and  Bali 

Hearing  Sugriva's  gracious  speech,  Rama,  in  order  to  inspire 
him  with  confidence,  took  up  his  bow  and  a  formidable  arrow, 
and  taking  aim,  pierced  the  Sala  trees,  filling  the  firmament 
with  the  sound. 

Loosed  by  that  mighty  warrior,  the  arrow,  decorated  with 
gold,  passed  through  the  seven  Sala  trees  and  entering  the 
mountain,  buried  itself  in  the  earth.    In  the  twinkling  of  an 
195  o 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

eye  that  shaft  with  the  speed  of  lightning,  having  pierced  the 
seven  trees  with  extreme  velocity,  returned  to  Rama's  quiver. 
Seeing  those  seven  trees  pierced  by  Rama's  impetuous  arrow, 
that  Bull  among  Monkeys  was  extremely  astonished  and, 
overcome  with  joy  adorned  with  all  his  ornaments,  prostrated 
himself  before  Raghava  with  joined  palms,  his  forehead 
touching  the  earth, 

Amazed  at  Rama's  prowess,  he  addressed  that  great  warrior, 
skilled  in  the  scriptural  traditions,  as  also  in  the  use  of  every 
weapon,  who  stood  before  him  and  said  : — 

"  O  Lion  among  Men,  with  thine  arrows,  thou  art  able  to 
destroy  all  the  Gods  with  their  King  in  combat,  why  not 
Bali  also?  O  Kakutstha,  who  can  resist  thee  on  the  field  of 
battle,  thou,  who  hast  pierced  seven  Sala  trees,  the  mountain 
and  the  earth  with  a  single  arrow !  Now  my  anxieties  are 
dispelled  and  my  satisfaction  complete.  Where  could  I  find 
a  friend  such  as  thou,  who  art  equal  to  Mahendra  and 
Varuna  ?  For  my  sake  do  thou  subdue  mine  adversary  in  the 
form  of  a  brother,  I  implore  thee !  " 

Rama,  embracing  the  handsome  Sugriva,  like  unto  Laksh- 
mana,  in  his  great  wisdom  answered  him,  saying : — 

"  Let  us  leave  here  without  delay  for  Kishkindha.  Do  thou 
precede  us.  When  we  come  to  that  city,  O  Sugriva,  it  is  for 
thee  to  challenge  Bali,  who  is  a  brother  in  name  only." 

Thereafter  they  started  out  in  all  haste  for  Kishkindha,  Bali's 
capital.  Concealing  themselves  behind  some  trees,  they 
halted  in  a  dense  wood  where  Sugriva  hurled  defiance  at  Bah' 
with  a  deep  and  challenging  roar.  His  clothes  tightly  wrapped 
round  him,  he  shouted  with  all  bis  strength,  shattering 
the  silence  of  the  firmament. 

When  the  powerful  Bah  heard  his  brother  emitting  this 
tremendous  clamour,  he  was  livid  with  anger  and  rushed  out 
like  the  sun  rising  over  the  mountain  top.  Then  a  terrible  struggle 
ensued  between  Bah  and  Sugriva,  resembling  the  clash  of 
Mars  and  Jupiter,  in  the  heavens. 

With  the  striking  of  their  palms  like  the  clap  of  thunder  and 
their  fists  that  were  as  hard  as  diamonds,  the  two  brothers, 
filled  with  fury,  assaulted  each  other,  whilst  Rama,  bow  in  hand, 
watched  those  two  combatants,  who  resembled  the  Ashwins. 
r  96 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

Not  being  able  to  distinguish  between  Bali  and  Sugriva, 
Rama  was  loath  to  loose  his  death-dealing  shaft.  Then 
Sugriva,  overcome  by  Bali,  seeing  that  Rama  refrained  from 
coming  to  his  aid,  ran  towards  the  Rishyamuka  Mountain. 
Exhausted,  his  limbs  covered  with  blood,  crushed  by  his 
brother's  blows,  who  pressed  him  furiously,  he  took  refuge  in 
the  vast  forest.  The  mighty  Bali,  seeing  him  penetrating 
deep  into  the  woods,  said : — 

"  Go !  I  spare  thee !  "  he  himself  not  venturing  to  enter 
there,  through  fear  of  the  curse. 

Then  Rama,  accompanied  by  his  brother  and  Hanuman,  re- 
entering the  wood,  found  the  monkey  Sugriva.  When  the 
latter  perceived  Rama  returning  with  Lakshmana,  he  hung  his 
head  in  shame  and  in  a  tearful  voice,  his  eyes  fixed  on  the 
ground,  said : — 

"After  demonstrating  thy  strength,  thou  didst  issue  the 
command :  '  Challenge  thine  adversary !  *  Thereafter  thou 
didst  allow  him  to  defeat  me.  Why  hast  thou  done  this  ? 
O  Raghava,  thou  shouldst  have  told  me  frankly :  *  I  do  not 
wish  to  slay  Bali,'  then  1  would  not  have  left  this  place."  Thus 
in  sad  and  reproachful  tones  did  the  great-souled  Sugriva 
speak,  and  Rama  answered  him,  saying : — 

"  O  Sugriva,  My  Dear  Friend,  do  not  vex  thyself  but  hear 
the  reason  why  I  did  not  discharge  mine  arrow.  Thine 
ornaments,  clothes,  shape  and  gestures  and  those  of  Bali  so 
resembled  each  other  that  there  was  no  difference  between 
you  !  The  voice,  colour,  look,  prowess  and  speech  were  wholly 
similar,  O  Monkey!  Disconcerted  by  thine  exact  resemblance, 
O  Best  of  Monkeys,  I  did  not  let  fly  my  swift  and  dreadful 
death-dealing  arrow,  the  slayer  of  the  foe,  for  this  reason. 
'  One  must  have  a  care  not  to  destroy  them  both,'  I  reflected. 
In  truth,  had  I  made  an  end  of  thine  existence,  O  Chief  of  the 
Monkeys,  through  ignorance  or  carelessness,  then  my  stupidity 
and  heedlessness  would  have  been  apparent.  To  kill  one's 
ally  is  assuredly  a  great  and  heinous  sin.  Further,  I,  Laksh- 
mana and  the  fair-complexioned  Sita  are  all  wholly  dependent 
on  thee ;  in  the  forest,  thou  art  our  refuge.  Enter  once  more 
into  combat,  therefore,  and  fear  nothing,  O  Monkey.  In  the 
twinkling  of  an  eye,  thou  shalt  see  me  piercing  Bali  with  my 
197 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

shaft  and  striking  him  down;  thou  shalt  see  him  writhing 
on  the  field  of  battle.  Do  thou,  however,  wear  a  distinguishing 
sign,  O  Chief  of  the  Monkeys,  by  the  help  of  which  I  may 
recognize  thee  in  the  thick  of  the  struggle.  O  Lakshmana, 
these  blossoming  and  beautiful  Gajapushpi  flowers,  do  thou 
place  round  the  neck  of  the  magnanimous  Sugriva." 

Plucking  the  blossoming  Gajapushpi  from  where  it  grew, 
Lakshmana  placed  it  round  the  neck  of  Sugriva.  The  creeper 
that  the  fortunate  Sugriva  wore  round  his  neck  was  as  bright 
as  the  sun  and  resembled  a  circle  of  cranes  illumining  a  cloud 
over  which  they  are  planing.  Sparkling  with  beauty  and 
encouraged  by  Rama's  words,  Sugriva  started  on  the  road  to 
Kishkindha  with  him. 


CHAPTER     I  3 

The  Hermitage  of  Saptajanas 

The  virtuous  elder  brother  of  Lakshmana,  together  with 
Sugriva,  left  the  Rishyamuka  Mountain  and  proceeded  towards 
Kishkindha,  which  was  maintained  by  Bali's  valour,  Rama 
bearing  his  golden  bow  and  carrying  his  arrows  that  shone 
like  the  sun  in  his  hand. 

Sugriva,  his  neck  adorned  with  a  wreath  of  flowers,  full  of 
courage,  strode  before  the  magnanimous  Raghava  and  Laksh- 
mana, behind  whom  came  the  hero  Hanuman  with  Nala,  the 
valiant  Nila  and  the  illustrious  general  Tara,  renowned  among 
the  monkeys. 

They  observed  the  trees  bowed  with  the  weight  of  their 
flowers  and  the  rivers  bearing  their  peaceful  waters  to  the  sea. 
The  ravines  and  cliffs  with  their  chasms,  caves,  peaks  and 
charming  dales,  the  lakes  with  their  limpid  waters  of  emerald 
hue,  adorned  with  opening  lotus  buds,  drew  their  gaze  as  they 
passed.  Ducks,  cranes,  swans,  woodcock  and  other  waterfowl 
were  heard  calling,  whilst  in  the  clearings  of  the  woods  deer 
could  be  seen  grazing  on  the  tender  grass  and  young  shoots, 
without  fear  of  the  wild  beasts  that  roamed  everywhere. 

Wild  and  ferocious  elephants  adorned  with  ivory  tusks, 
who  proved  a  menace  to  the  lakes  by  causing  the  banks  to 
198 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

crumble,  wandered  about  here  and  there  and  intoxicated  with 
Mada  juice,  striking  their  foreheads  against  the  rocks,  resembled 
moving  mountains.  Monkeys  as  large  as  elephants,  covered 
with  dust  and  every  species  of  wild  beast  and  bird  were 
seen  by  the  followers  of  Sugriva  as  they  passed  on  their 
way. 

Advancing  thus  in  all  haste,  the  Joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu, 
Rama,  seeing  a  grove  of  trees,  enquired  of  Sugriva  : — "  What 
is  this  clump  of  trees  like  a  cloud  in  the  sky  ?  Indeed  they 
seem  like  a  mass  of  clouds  ringed  round  by  plantain  groves ! 
Great  is  my  curiosity  concerning  them,  O  My  Friend.  I 
wish  to  learn  of  thee  what  these  are." 

On  this  enquiry  from  Rama,  Sugriva,  still  walking  on,  told 
him  the  history  of  that  great  wood.  "  O  Rama  !  It  is  a  vast 
hermitage  that  removes  all  weariness  and  encloses  many 
pleasant  gardens  and  groves ;  the  roots,  fruit  and  water  are 
delicious.  Under  the  name  of  Saptajanas,  seven  Munis  of 
rigid  vows  lived  there,  lying  in  the  water,  their  heads  alone 
emerging  from  it.  Every  seven  days  they  partook  of  food, 
which  was  the  wind  from  the  mountain  on  which  they  dwelt. 
After  seven  hundred  years  they  ascended  to  heaven  in  their 
bodies.  Through  the  power  of  their  asceticism,  this  hermitage, 
encircled  by  a  hedge  of  trees,  is  inaccessible  even  to  the  Gods 
and  Asuras,  as  well  as  their  leaders.  The  birds  eschew  it,  as 
also  the  other  beasts  of  the  forest ;  those  who  enter  it  un- 
wittingly never  return.  Lovely  melodies  are  heard  issuing 
therefrom  with  the  music  of  instruments  and  singing.  Some- 
times a  divine  fragrance  is  spread  abroad  from  there,  O 
Raghava,  and  three  fires  are  lit ;  it  is  their  smoke  that  one  can 
see  from  here ;  the  tops  of  the  trees  are  enveloped  in  it  like  a 
golden  cloud,  resembling  the  plumage  of  a  dove. 

"  These  trees  are  magnificent  with  their  tops  crowned  with 
smoke,  like  unto  mountains  of  emerald  crowned  with  rain 
clouds.  Pay  obeisance  with  reverence  to  them  with  joined 
palms,  O  Valiant  Raghava,  as  also  thy  brother,  Lakshmana. 
Those  who  offer  salutations  to  those  Rishis  of  pure  soul  experi- 
ence naught  that  is  grievous." 

Then  Raghava  with  his  brother  Lakshmana,  with  joined 
palms,  offered  salutations  to  those  illustrious  ascetics.    Having 
199 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

paid  reverence  to  them,  the  virtuous  Rama,  his  brother  Laksh- 
mana  and  Sugriva  with  his  monkeys  went  on  happily. 

Having  left  the  hermitage  of  Saptajanas  far  behind,  they 
beheld  the  inaccessible  Kishkindha  protected  by  Bali.  Rama, 
his  younger  brother  Lakshmana  and  the  monkeys,  famed  for 
their  valour,  seizing  their  weapons,  once  more  prepared  to  slay 
their  enemy  in  that  city  which  the  son  of  the  Chief  of  the 
Gods  protected  by  his  prowess. 


chapter    i  4 

Sugriva  again  challenges  his  brother  to  fight 

Returning  to  Kishkindha,  Bali's  city,  they  all  concealed 
themselves  behind  the  trees  in  the  dense  forest.  Glancing 
round  on  every  side,  the  Friend  of  the  Woods,  the  thick- 
necked  Sugriva  began  to  exhibit  signs  of  extreme  anger  and, 
surrounded  by  bis  kinsmen,  let  out  a  loud  roar,  challenging 
his  brother  to  fight.  Shattering  the  firmament  with  his  war- 
cry  which  resembled  a  great  thundercloud  propelled  by  a 
high  wind,  that  monkey,  who  was  endowed  with  a  leonine 
gait  and  resembled  the  rising  sun,  stepped  forth. 

Looking  at  Rama  who  was  skilled  in  combat,  Sugriva  said 
to  him : — "  Behold  Kishkindha,  surrounded  by  its  walls  made 
of  gold  and  a  rampart  of  monkeys,  that  is  bristling  with  instru- 
ments of  war  and  from  which  innumerable  banners  stream. 
This  is  Bali's  citadel.  Now  fulfil  the  promise  formerly  made 
to  me  of  slaying  him,  O  Hero,  as  the  blessing  of  Spring  visits 
the  creepers." 

At  Sugriva's  words,  the  virtuous  Rama,  the  destroyer  of 
his  foes,  answered : — "  Thou  art  wearing  that  which  will 
enable  me  to  distinguish  thee,  this  garland  of  Gaja  flowers, 
placed  by  Lakshmana  round  thy  neck !  This  creeper  worn 
by  thee  lends  thee  the  brilliance  of  the  sky  in  which  the  sun 
is  surrounded  by  stars,  O  Warrior.  To-day,  O  Monkey,  I 
will  deliver  thee  from  the  fear  and  hostility  that  Bali  inspires 
in  thee.    Point  out  thine  adversary  in  the  guise  of  a  brother, 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

O  Sugriva  1  Till  Bali  is  struck  down  in  the  forest,  let  him 
make  merry,  for  when  he  crosses  my  path,  he  will  not  return 
alive.  If  he  should  do  so,  thou  wilt  be  justified  in  reproaching 
me  for  not  honouring  my  word. 

"  In  thy  presence,  seven  Sala  trees  were  transfixed  by  me 
with  a  single  arrow;  rest  assured  that  Bali  will  fall  to-day 
on  the  field  of  battle  under  my  shafts. 

"  No  light  word  has  ever  passed  my  lips,  even  in  adversity, 
nor  ever  shall,  even  were  it  to  attain  my  purpose  ;  therefore 
banish  all  anxiety. 

"  Like  a  field  rendered  fertile  by  the  rains  of  Shatakratu,  do 
thou  challenge  Bali  of  the  golden  diadem.  O  Sugriva,  raise 
a  shout  that  will  cause  that  monkey,  proud  of  his  victory, 
whom  thou  wert  unable  to  subdue  before,  and  who  is  bellicose 
by  nature,  to  come  forth.  Those  who  deem  themselves  brave 
are  not  able  to  endure  the  war-cry  of  their  foes,  above  all  in 
the  presence  of  women." 

Hearing  Rama's  words,  the  golden-hued  Sugriva  let  out  a 
deafening  roar,  rending  the  skies. 

Terrified  by  the  clamour,  the  kine  ran  hither  and  thither, 
like  noble  women  exposed  to  danger  of  hostile  attack  through 
the  negligence  of  their  loved  ones,  and  the  wild  deer  fled  away 
like  maddened  war  horses  wounded  in  battie,  whilst  the  birds 
fell  to  the  ground  like  planets  whose  virtue  is  exhausted. 

Then  that  son  of  Surya  emitted  a  roar  resembling  thunder, 
confident  of  his  strength  and  radiant  with  courage,  like  the 
ocean  whose  waves  are  lashed  by  a  tempest. 


CHAPTER    i  5 

Tara's  Advice  to  Bali 

His  brother  Bali,  who  was  seated  amidst  his  wives  in  the  inner 
apartments,  heard  the  cry  of  the  great-hearted  Sugriva  and 
was  filled  with  wrath.  When  he  caught  the  sound  of  that 
uproar,  causing  terror  to  all  beings,  his  feelings  of  lust  changed 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALM1KI 

to  those  of  violent  anger  and,  his  limbs  trembling  with  fury, 
he  who  formerly  shone  like  gold  suddenly  lost  his  brilliance, 
like  the  sun  under  eclipse.  Grinding  his  teeth,  his  eyes  flash- 
ing with  fire,  he  resembled  a  lake  from  which  the  lotuses  have 
been  uprooted.  Hearing  that  unendurable  cry,  that  monkey 
strode  forth  in  great  haste,  stamping  on  the  earth  as  if  he 
wished  to  shatter  it. 

Then  Tara,  embracing  him  tenderly,  once  more  avowed  her 
devotion  to  him  and,  timid  and  troubled,  addressed  him  in 
these  words,  the  wisdom  of  which  the  future  was  to  prove  : — 

"  O  Brave  Warrior,  this  anger  that  has  taken  hold  of  thee 
is  like  a  raging  torrent ;  do  thou  abandon  it,  as  on  rising  in 
the  morning  thou  dost  throw  aside  a  faded  garland.  To- 
morrow at  dawn,  enter  into  combat  with  Sugriva,  O  Valiant 
Forest  Dweller,  for  thou  dost  not  yet  know  the  strength  or 
weakness  of  thine  enemy.  That  thou  shouldst  set  out  immedi- 
ately does  not  meet  with  my  approval.  Hear  while  I  tell 
thee  the  reason  why  I  seek  to  delay  thee ! 

"  Formerly  Sugriva,  in  great  anger,  came  hither  and  challenged 
thee  to  fight,  but  defeated  and  overwhelmed  by  thy  blows, 
he  fled.  Having  been  assaulted  and  crushed  in  this  wise, 
he  now  returns  to  challenge  thee  again,  which  rouses  my 
suspicion.  To  roar  thus  in  so  insolent  and  arrogant  a  manner, 
so  filled  with  wrath,  is  not  done  without  a  particular  motive. 
To  my  mind,  Sugriva  has  not  returned  alone  but  has  an  escort 
who  is  ready  to  rush  to  his  defence ;  hence  this  cry  of  defiance. 
Sugriva  is  a  naturally  clever  and  sagacious  monkey  and  will 
never  ally  himself  to  one  whose  valour  has  not  been  tried. 
This,  O  Warrior,  is  what  I  have  heard  from  the  youthful 
Prince  Angada;  take  heed  therefore  and  have  a  care;  it  is 
to  thine  advantage !  He  hath  told  me  all  that  he  has  heard 
from  his  emissaries  concerning  Sugriva  while  journeying  in  the 
forest.  Two  sons  were  bora  to  the  King  of  Ayodhya,  full  of 
courage,  invincible  in  combat ;  they  are  of  the  House  of 
Ikshwaku  and  are  renowned ;  their  names  are  Rama  and 
Lakshmana. 

"  These  two  indomitable  heroes  have  sealed  a  pact  of  friend- 
ship with  Sugriva,  and  this  ally  of  thy  brother  is  Rama,  famed 
for  his  military  exploits,  the  Destroyer  of  Enemy  Hosts,  who 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

resembles  the  fire  at  the  end  of  the  world  cycle.  He  dwells 
in  the  forest  and  is  the  supreme  refuge  of  all  the  virtuous 
who  seek  his  protection.  He  is  the  support  of  the  oppressed, 
the  unique  repository  of  all  glory  and  is  conversant  with  both 
secular  and  spiritual  learning ;  his  pleasure  consists  in  carrying 
out  the  behests  of  bis  Sire. 

"  As  the  King  of  the  Mountains  is  a  treasury  of  precious 
metals,  so  is  he  a  mine  of  every  good  quality.  It  is  peace 
and  not  war  that  thou  shouldst  seek  with  that  magnanimous 
One,  the  invincible  Rama,  whose  prowess  on  the  battlefield 
is  without  limit.  O  Hero,  I  have  no  desire  to  oppose  thee, 
but  tell  thee  this  for  thy  good.  Therefore,  heed  my  counsel ! 
Do  not  seek  a  quarrel  with  thy  younger  brother,  O  Valiant 
Monarch.  I  am  certain  it  is  to  thine  advantage  to  contract 
a  friendship  with  Rama.  Reconcile  thyself  with  Sugriva  and 
put  all  thoughts  of  hatred  far  from  thee.  Thy  younger  brother 
is  an  inhabitant  of  the  forest  of  amiable  qualities.  Whether  he 
dwell  here  or  there,  he  is  bound  to  thee  from  every  point  of 
view,  and  I  do  not  see  any  like  him  in  the  world.  With  gifts, 
honours  and  in  other  ways,  bind  him  to  thyself  through  kind- 
ness. Abandon  thine  ill-will  and  let  him  in  future  dwell  near 
thee.  The  thick-necked  Sugriva  is  a  powerful,  valuable  and 
natural  ally.  Win  back  thy  brother's  affection ;  there  is  no 
other  way  to  happiness  for  thee  here.  If  thou  dost  desire  to 
please  me  and  recognizest  my  devotion  to  thee,  then  in  the 
name  of  affection,  O  My  Friend,  I  implore  thee  to  act  as  I 
have  counselled.  Follow  my  advice  which  is  salutary;  trust 
me  and  do  not  give  way  to  anger ;  live  in  peace  with  the  son 
of  the  King  of  Koshala ;  do  not  quarrel  with  him,  his  valour 
is  equal  to  Indra's." 

In  these  words,  which  were  full  of  wisdom  and  would  have 
enabled  him  to  save  himself,  Tara  addressed  Bali,  but  he 
refused  to  listen  and,  driven  by  the  force  of  destiny,  advanced 
to  meet  his  death. 


203 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER     16 

Rama  inflicts  a  mortal  Wound  on  Bali 

Thus  spoke  Tara,  whose  face  was  as  radiant  as  the  moon, 
and  Bali  answered  her  in  tones  of  reproach,  saying: — 

"  When  my  brother,  who  is  above  all  mine  adversary, 
challenges  me  in  anger,  how  shall  I  endure  it,  O  Lady  of 
Lovely  Countenance  ?  The  brave  who  are  not  accustomed  to 
bearing  insults  and  who  never  turn  back  in  battle,  O  Timid 
One,  would  rather  suffer  death  than  such  ignominy.  I  may 
not  disregard  the  weak-necked  Sugriva  who,  in  his  determination 
to  enter  into  combat,  has  offered  me  so  insolent  a  challenge. 

"  Have  no  anxiety  on  my  behalf  regarding  Raghava,  for  he  is 
conversant  with  dharma  and  pious  by  nature.  How  could  he 
do  wrong  ?  Return  home  with  thy  companions !  Why  follow 
me  further  ?  Thou  hast  demonstrated  thy  tender  devotion 
sufficiently !  I  am  about  to  set  out  to  fight  Sugriva ;  control 
thine  emotions.  I  shall  punish  his  insolence,  but  I  shall  not 
take  his  life.  I  shall  enter  into  combat  with  him,  since  he 
desires  it,  and,  assailed  by  the  blows  dealt  with  my  fists  and 
the  trunks  of  trees,  he  will  flee.  That  coward  will  not  be 
able  to  withstand  my  strength  and  prowess.  O  Tara,  thou 
hast  accompanied  me  far  enough  and  shown  thine  affection 
for  me  sufficiently,  now  return,  and  I,  having  obtained  satis- 
faction from  my  brother  on  the  battlefield,  will  follow  thee; 
I  swear  it  by  my  life  and  race." 

Then  the  virtuous  Tara,  embracing  Bali  and  speaking 
tenderly  to  him,  weeping,  circumambulated  him,  keeping  him 
on  her  right  hand,  and  bidding  him  farewell  according  to  the 
tradition  and  reciting  the  sacred  texts  so  that  he  might  return 
victorious,  she  re-entered  the  inner  apartments,  distracted  with 
grief. 

When  Tara  reached  the  inner  sanctuary  with  the  other 
women,  Bali,  distraught  with  anger,  went  out  of  the  city, 
304 


KISHKINDHA    KAKDA 

hissing  like  a  great  serpent.  Full  of  ire,  breathing  heavily, 
he  ran  with  all  his  strength,  looking  round  on  every  side, 
eager  to  find  his  adversary. 

At  last  he  beheld  that  powerful  monkey,  the  golden-hued 
Sugriva,  clothed  in  excellent  armour,  full  of  confidence,  resem- 
bling a  brazier,  and,  seeing  him  inflated  with  pride,  Bali  wrapped 
his  garments  more  tightly  about  him,  a  prey  to  extreme  anger. 
Having  thus  girded  up  his  apparel,  his  fists  clenched,  full  of 
vigour,  he  advanced  to  meet  Sugriva  and  engage  him  in  combat. 
From  his  side,  Sugriva,  also  doubling  his  fists  in  rage,  went 
out  to  meet  his  brother  who  was  wearing  a  crown  of  gold. 

Then  Bali,  addressing  Sugriva,  whose  eyes  were  red  with 
anger,  who  was  skilled  in  the  art  of  fighting  and  was  rushing 
towards  him  in  fury,  said : — 

"  With  this  clenched  fist,  its  fingers  tightly  closed,  I  shall 
deal  thee  a  blow  that  will  cause  thee  to  yield  up  thy  life." 

At  these  words,  Sugriva,  livid  with  anger,  answered : — "  It 
is  mine  that  will  drive  the  life's  breath  out  of  thee  by  caving 
in  thy  skull."  Thereafter,  violently  assaulted  by  Bali,  he 
hurled  himself  on  him  in  fury,  rivers  of  blood  streaming  from 
him,  like  a  mountain  from  which  torrents  fall.  Unperturbed, 
Sugriva,  tearing  up  a  Sala  tree,  struck  his  rival's  body  as 
lightning  fells  a  mountain  peak.  Struck  by  the  Sala  tree 
which  unnerved  him,  Bali  resembled  a  heavily-laden  ship, 
sinking  with  all  its  cargo  in  the  waves.  Endowed  with  terrific 
strength  and  as  agile  as  Suparna,  both  fought  like  two 
formidable  giants  resembling  the  sun  and  moon  in  the  sky. 
Each  of  these  two  destroyers  of  their  foes  sought  to  find  the 
weak  point  of  his  enemy. 

Bali  excelled  in  strength  and  valour  while  the  son  of  Surya, 
Sugriva,  despite  his  great  energy,  was  the  weaker,  and  his 
courage  beginning  to  dwindle,  he  ceased  to  boast  and,  enraged 
with  his  brother,  made  a  sign  to  Rama. 

The  uprooted  trees  with  their  branches  and  crests,  the 
blows  from  fists,  knees  and  feet,  fell  thick  and  fast  in  the 
formidable  struggle  that  resembled  the  duel  between  Vritra 
and  Vasava.  Covered  with  blood,  the  two  monkeys,  dwellers 
in  the  forest,  whilst  fighting  resembled  two  thunderclouds 
clashing  together  with  a  great  uproar. 
205 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Rama,  observing  Sugriva,  the  Prince  of  Monkeys,  exhausted 
scanning  the  horizon  without  ceasing  to  struggle,  and,  seeing 
that  he  was  almost  overcome,  selected  an  arrow  for  the  purpose 
of  slaying  Bali,  and  that  great  hero  stretched  his  bow  and  with 
that  shaft,  resembling  a  venomous  serpent,  held  it  ready, 
like  Antaka,  bearing  the  Wheel  of  Time.  The  twanging  of 
the  bowstring  caused  alarm  among  the  birds,  who  flew  away, 
as  also  the  wild  beasts  who  fled  in  terror  as  at  the  end  of  the 
world  period. 

Discharged  by  Rama  with  a  sound  like  the  crash  of  thunder, 
that  formidable  arrow  of  dazzling  aspect  pierced  Bali's  breast, 
and  under  its  fatal  impact  the  powerful  and  valiant  King  of 
the  Monkeys  fell  to  the  earth,  resembling  Indra's  banner 
ruthlessly  thrown  to  the  ground  on  the  day  of  the  full  moon 
in  the  month  of  the  constellation  of  Aries. 

Stricken  and  senseless,  Bah  fell,  his  voice  strangled  with  sobs 
which  gradually  died  away.  Rama,  the  strongest  of  men, 
discharged  that  formidable,  fiery  and  death-dealing  arrow, 
shining  like  gold,  resembling  Time  itself  at  the  end  of  the 
world,  which  shot  forth  like  smoke  issuing  from  the  flaming 
mouth  of  Hara,  and,  streaming  with  blood  looked  like  unto 
a  blossoming  Ashoka  tree  on  the  mountain-side,  whereupon 
the  Son  of  Vasava,  like  the  banner  of  Indra  that  has  been 
overthrown,  fell  senseless  on  the  field  of  battle. 


chapter    i  7 

Bali  reproaches  Rama 

Struck  by  Rama's  arrow,  that  doughty  warrior  fell  to  the 
earth,  like  a  tree  severed  by  an  axe.  With  his  ornaments  of 
fine  gold,  his  limbs  paralysed,  he  sank  to  the  ground,  like  the 
banner  of  the  Chief  of  the  Gods,  its  cord  severed. 

At  the  tall  of  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  the  earth  grew  dark, 

resembling  the  firmament  bereft  of  the  moon.     Though  lying 

on  the  earth,  the  body  of  that  high-souled  Bah  was  neither 

robbed  of  its  beauty  nor  of  its  life's  breath,  nor  did  his  courage 

206 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

fail  him,  for  that  excellent  golden  necklace  that  Indra  had 
bestowed  on  him  preserved  the  life,  strength  and  beauty  of 
that  Lord  of  Monkeys.  Adorned  with  that  golden  chain, 
the  heroic  Monkey  Chief  appeared  like  an  evening  cloud 
tinged  with  the  roseate  hues  of  dusk !  His  chain,  his  body 
and  the  arrow  piercing  bis  heart  blazed  in  triple  glory,  even 
after  he  had  fallen.  That  arrow  loosed  by  the  valiant  Rama 
from  his  bow,  by  its  virtue  opening  the  way  to  heaven,  brought 
Bali  supreme  deliverance. 

Lying  on  the  field  of  battle,  like  a  fire  without  flame,  he 
resembled  Yayati  cast  forth  from  the  divine  realms,  fallen  on 
the  earth,  his  merits  exhausted.  Like  the  sun  that  Time,  at 
the  end  of  the  world,  throws  down  on  the  earth  ;  unapproach- 
able like  Mahendra,  inaccessible  as  Upendra,  with  his  golden 
necklace,  his  broad  chest,  his  vast  arms,  his  mouth  inflamed, 
his  glances  wild,  that  son  of  a  mighty  king  lay.  And  Rama 
followed  by  Lakshmana,  their  eyes  fixed  upon  him,  approached 
that  warrior  lying  there  like  a  naked  flame  about  to  be  quenched. 
Full  of  respect  for  that  hero,  who  was  gazing  at  them,  the  two 
valiant  brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  approached  with 
slow  steps. 

On  perceiving  them,  the  supremely  courageous  Bali  uttered 
these  harsh  words,  that  seemed  both  restrained  and  just. 
Stretched  on  the  earth,  almost  without  lustre,  mortally  wounded, 
motionless,  in  words  pregnant  with  meaning  he  addressed 
that  warrior  proudly,  saying : — 

"  Striking  me  from  behind,  what  merit  dost  thou  hope  to 
earn  by  this,  O  Thou  who  hast  inflicted  a  mortal  wound  on 
me,  while  I  was  engaged  in  combat  with  another  ?  *  The  virtu- 
ous Rama  is  full  of  nobility,  generosity  and  valour ;  he  is 
compassionate,  devoted  to  the  welfare  of  all  beings,  fixed  in 
his  duty ;  gracious,  omnipotent  and  conversant  with  the  rules 
of  conduct  and  austerity  ;  these  are  the  praises  sung  of  thee, 
these  are  the  merits  attributed  to  thee  by  the  whole  world! 

**  Self-mastery,  forbearance,  loyalty,  fixity  of  purpose,  good- 
will and  heroism  are  the  virtues  of  kings,  O  Prince,  as  also 
the  repression  of  evil  deeds.  It  was  reflecting  on  these  virtues, 
believing  them  to  be  thine,  that  I  came  to  fight  Sugriva. 
'Whilst  I  am  filled  with  rage  and  engaged  in  combat  with 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

another,  he  will  not  attack  me'  was  my  conviction,  even 
without  knowing  thee.  Now  I  perceive  that  thou  art  a 
perverse  creature,  feigning  piety  whilst  in  truth  thou  art 
like  a  well  concealed  in  the  grass,  without  faith  and  resorting 
to  evil  deeds.  Outwardly  virtuous,  wearing  the  cloak  of  integrity, 
thou  art  in  reality  a  scoundrel,  like  a  fire  bidden  by  ashes,  nor 
do  I  recognize  thee  behind  the  concealing  mask  of  virtue. 

"  Since  I  have  neither  laid  waste  thy  land,  nor  thy  city 
and  have  not  offered  thee  insult,  why  hast  thou  destroyed  me 
— I  who  am  guiltless  and  who  have  ever  fed  on  fruit  and 
roots,  a  monkey  dwelling  in  the  forest,  who  never  sought  to 
enter  into  combat  with  thee  but  who  was  engaged  in  fighting 
another  ?  Thou  art  the  son  of  a  king  and  inspired  confidence 
by  thy  benign  aspect  and,  what  is  more,  thou  wearest  the 
livery  of  sanctity ;  who  of  the  warrior  caste,  conversant  with 
what  is  good  and  evil,  in  the  garb  of  a  righteous  man,  would 
commit  such  a  wicked  deed  ? 

"  Thou  art  born  of  the  House  of  Raghu  and  art  spoken  of 
as  virtuous,  how  canst  thou,  assuming  the  guise  of  an  ascetic, 
wander  about  thus  ?  Equanimity  of  soul,  liberality,  forbear- 
ance, justice,  loyalty,  constancy  and  courage  are  the  character- 
istics of  a  king,  O  Prince,  also  the  meting  out  of  punishment 
to  the  guilty. 

"  We  live  in  the  forest,  O  Rama,  and  are  but  wild  beasts 
who  feed  on  roots  and  fruits,  which  is  natural  to  us ;  but 
thou  art  a  man,  O  Prince !  Land,  gold  and  beauty  are  the 
causes  of  ctiscord,  but  here  in  the  woods,  who  will  envy  us 
fruit  and  roots  ?  In  temporal  and  spiritual  matters,  as  well  as 
in  the  dispensing  of  reward  and  punishment,  a  king  should 
be  wholly  given  up  to  the  task  of  government  and  not  dominated 
by  any  desire  for  pleasure,  but  thou  art  consumed  by  thy 
desires ;  irascible,  restless,  disregarding  the  royal  code,  thy 
bow  is  thy  cherished  argument !  Thou  dost  not  pursue  the  path 
of  duty  nor  does  thine  understanding  concern  itself  with  the 
interests  of  the  people ;  a  slave  to  lust,  thou  dost  permit  thy 
senses  to  rule  thee,  O  Chief  of  Men.  In  a  word,  Kakutstha, 
thou  hast  slain  me,  who  never  did  thee  any  harm !  How  wilt 
thou  answer  in  the  assembly  of  the  virtuous,  having  committed 
this  reprehensible  deed  ? 

208 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

"  The  regicide,  the  brahmanicide,  the  slayer  of  the  cow,  the 
thief  and  the  one  who  finds  pleasure  in  the  destruction  of 
other  beings,  the  unbeliever  and  the  one  who  weds  before  his 
elder  brother,  all  these  enter  hell.  The  informer,  the  miser, 
the  one  who  slays  his  friend  or  denies  his  Guru's  bed,  un- 
doubtedly descends  to  the  region  of  evil-doers  ! 

"  It  is  not  permitted  to  the  well-born  to  clothe  themselves 
in  my  skin,  nor  may  those,  such  as  thou,  partake  of  my  flesh 
if  they  follow  the  tradition.  There  are  five  kinds  of  animals 
possessing  five  nails  on  each  paw  that  may  be  enjoyed  by  the 
brahmin  and  the  warrior,  O  Rama.  They  are  the  porcupine, 
the  hedgehog,  the  deer,  the  hare  and  the  tortoise.  O  Rama, 
men  of  worth  will  not  touch  my  skin  or  bones  nor  eat  my  flesh. 

"  Alas !  I  disregarded  Tara,  who,  sagacious  and  prudent, 
offered  me  sound  counsel,  but  in  my  folly,  overpowered  by 
fate,  I  did  not  heed  it.  O  Kakutstha,  like  a  virtuous  woman 
who  has  married  a  man  devoid  of  faith,  the  earth  is  without  a 
protector,  since  thou  art  its  protector.  How  canst  thou  be 
born  of  the  magnanimous  Dasaratha,  seeing  that  thou  art 
deceitful,  mischievous,  evil-hearted  and  treacherous  ?  Having 
exceeded  the  bounds  of  restraint,  broken  the  law  of  the  virtuous 
and  disregarded  the  goad  of  justice,  that  elephant,  Rama, 
has  struck  me  down.  Guilty  of  such  an  infamy,  condemned 
by  the  wise,  finding  thyself  in  their  presence,  what  wilt  thou  say? 

"  That  valour  that  has  been  so  greatly  vaunted  to  us  who 
are  neutral,  I  do  not  see  thee  exercising  against  evil-doers  I 
If  thou  hadst  fought  me  openly,  O  Prince,  thou  wouldst  now 
find  thyself  in  the  presence  of  death,  having  been  slain  by  me. 
Thou  didst  overcome  me  by  taking  me  unawares,  as  a  serpent 
bites  a  sleeping  man,  I  who  was  else  invincible.  Thou  art  ruled 
by  evil.    In  order  to  gratify  Sugriva,  thou  hast  struck  me  down. 

"  If  thou  hadst  first  confided  thy  purpose  to  me,  I  would 
have  brought  Sita  back  to  thee  in  a  day.  Not  only  this,  but 
I  should  have  placed  that  wicked  ravisher  of  thy  spouse,  the 
titan,  Ravana,  in  thy  power,  a  chain  round  his  neck,  having 
laid  him  low  in  combat.  Even  if  Sita  had  been  cast  into  the 
bottom  of  the  sea  or  hell  itself,  I  should  have  brought  her 
back  to  thee  at  thy  command,  as  Vishnu  recovered  the  scriptures 
that  had  been  borne  away  by  Hayagriva. 
209 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Sugriva  would  have  obtained  the  throne  legitimately  on 
my  departure  to  the  celestial  realm,  whereas  now  he  has 
acquired  it  wrongfully,  since  thou  hast  overcome  me  by  craft 
on  the  field  of  battle.  As  death  in  this  world  is  inevitable, 
I  hold  it  as  naught  but  how  wilt  thou  justify  thy  conduct 
towards  me  ?  " 

Thus,  pierced  by  an  arrow,  his  features  altered,  did  that 
magnanimous  son  of  the  Monarch  of  Monkeys  speak  whilst 
looking  on  Rama,  who  was  as  radiant  as  the  sun,  after  which 
he  fell  silent. 


CHAPTER     I  8 

Rama  answers  Bali 

Such  was  the  speech,  dictated  by  a  sense  of  duty  and  his  own 
interests,  full  of  censure  and  harsh  in  tone,  that  Bali,  who  was 
mortally  wounded,  made  to  Rama.  Resembling  the  sun 
shorn  of  its  rays  or  a  parched  cloud  or  a  fire  that  has  been 
extinguished,  that  illustrious  King  of  the  Monkeys,  endowed 
with  justice  and  reason,  having  upbraided  Rama  with  severity, 
was  addressed  by  him  in  the  following  words : — 

"  O  Bali,  why  dost  thou  inveigh  against  me  like  a  child, 
since  thou  art  wholly  ignorant  of  the  traditions  of  duty,  profit 
and  social  convention?1  Without  consulting  thine  elders, 
who  are  held  in  respect  by  the  brahmins,  in  thy  simian  folly 
thou  hast  presumed  to  address  me  thus,  who  am  filled  with 
good-will  towards  thee. 

"  This  earth  belongs  to  the  Ikshwakus,  together  with  its 
mountains,  forests  and  woods  and  they  have  jurisdiction  over 
the  wild  beasts,  birds  and  men.  It  is  ruled  by  the  virtuous 
Bharata,  who  is  fixed  in  his  duty  and  fully  conversant  with 
the  law,  with  the  proper  means  to  acquisition  of  wealth  and  the 
right  pursuit  of  pleasure  and  who  is  ever  engaged  in  repressing 
evil-doers  and  recompensing  the  virtuous.  It  is  the  duty  of 
a  king  to  develop  the  art  of  government,  be  established  in 

1  See  Glossary  under  Dharma,  Artha,  Kama- 
310 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

virtue,  be  endowed  with  valour  and  know  how  to  estimate 
time  and  place.  We  other  princes  carry  out  his  righteous 
commands  and  range  the  whole  earth  in  our  desire  to  promote 
the  law.  When  that  Lion  among  Men,  Bharata  who  cherishes 
equity,  rules  the  entire  world,  who  would  dare  to  commit  an 
injustice  ?  Fixed  in  our  supreme  duty,  obedient  to  Bharata's 
will,  in  accord  with  the  law,  we  put  down  transgression.  Thou 
hast  violated  justice  and  thy  conduct  is  condemned  by  all,  lust 
being  thine  only  mentor,  ignoring  as  thou  dost  the  royal  path. 

"  One  who  pursues  the  path  of  duty  should  regard  his  elder 
brother,  the  one  who  has  given  him  birth  and  the  one  who 
instructs  him  in  wisdom  as  his  three  fathers.  Righteousness 
demands  that  a  younger  brother,  a  son  and  a  virtuous  disciple 
should  be  regarded  as  one's  own  offspring;  even  for  the  virtuous, 
duty  is  subtle  and  not  easy  to  grasp,  the  soul  residing  in  the 
heart  alone  knows  what  is  right  and  wrong. 

"  O  Heedless  Monkey,  thou  art  surrounded  by  irresponsible 
simian  counsellors,  who  are  unable  to  control  themselves, 
thus  it  is  a  case  of  the  blind  leading  the  blind,  how  canst  thou 
learn  from  them  ?  I  am  speaking  frankly  to  thee ;  thou  hadst 
no  possible  right  to  reproach  me  in  my  wrath.  Learn  now 
for  what  reason  I  struck  thee  down. 

"  Thou  hast  acted  in  opposition  to  the  spiritual  law.  While 
Sugriva  yet  lives,  thou  hast  had  marital  relations  with  Ruma, 
who  is  thy  sister-in-law.  O  Perverse  Wretch,  in  order  to 
satisfy  thy  lust,  thou  hast  transgressed  the  law  of  righteousness 
and,  O  Monkey,  since  thou  hast  not  respected  thy  brother's 
wife,  this  retribution  has  followed  thee.  I  see  no  other  means 
of  restraining  him  who  acts  contrary  to  the  interests  of  his 
subjects  and  does  not  conform  to  the  social  code  but  by  punish- 
ment, O  King  of  the  Monkeys  ! 

"  Being  a  warrior  of  an  illustrious  race,  I  am  unable  to  brook 
thy  villainy.  The  man  who  makes  his  daughter,  his  sister  or 
his  sister-in-law  an  object  of  lust,  is  punishable  by  death; 
this  is  the  law ! 

"  Though  Bharata  is  the  supreme  monarch,  we  carry  out 
his  behests.  How  canst  thou  who  hast  broken  the  law,  escape 
punishment  ?  He  who  tails  to  listen  to  his  instructor  in  the 
form  of  the  law,  will  be  judged  according  to  the  law  by  the  King. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Bharata  seeks  to  repress  dissolute  customs,  and  we  who 
carry  out  his  commands  fully  try  to  bring  to  justice  those 
who,  like  thee,  overstep  the  boundaries  of  the  law,  O  Chief 
of  the  Monkeys. 

"  Sugriva  is  my  friend  and  equal  to  Lakshmana ;  it  is  for 
the  recovery  of  his  wife  and  kingdom  that  he  entered  into  a 
pact  of  friendship  with  me.  In  the  presence  of  his  ministers, 
I  pledged  my  word ;  how  can  a  man  like  myself  fail  to  meet 
these  obligations  ? 

"  For  all  these  reasons  based  on  the  law,  thou  canst  judge 
for  thyself,  whether  thy  punishment  is  merited  or  no.  That 
it  is  wholly  just,  thou  wilt  be  forced  to  admit  and,  further, 
that  one  is  bound  to  help  a  fnend  if  one  acknowledges  one's 
duty.  Thou  wouldst  have  done  likewise  if  thou  hadst  followed 
the  law.  Two  of  the  verses  of  Manu  are  specially  devoted 
to  these  rules  of  conduct  and  are  known  to  the  authorities  of 
the  law ;  I  have  been  faithful  to  them.  '  Those  men  who, 
having  done  wrong,  submit  to  the  penalty  imposed  by  the  king, 
are  washed  free  from  every  stain  and  ascend  to  heaven  like 
the  good  and  those  who  do  benevolent  deeds.  Further  punish- 
ment or  pardon  exonerates  the  thief  from  his  fault,  but  the 
king  who  does  not  put  down  vice  himself  assumes  the  guilt.' 

"  My  worthy  ancestor  Mandhata  voluntarily  underwent  a 
terrible  expiation  for  a  monk  who  was  guilty  of  an  offence 
similar  to  thine  whom  he  pardoned.  Other  monarchs,  in  their 
folly,  have  also  done  wrong,  but  have  practiced  penance ;  it 
is  by  this  means  that  passion  is  subdued.  But  enough  of 
recriminations !  Thy  death  has  been  decreed  in  accordance 
with  the  spiritual  law,  O  Lion  among  Monkeys ;  we  are  not 
acting  on  personal  impulse. 

"  Listen  to  a  further  reason,  O  Valiant  Bull  among  Monkeys; 
having  grasped  its  significance,  thou  wilt  no  longer  be  able 
to  reproach  me.  Neither  did  I  follow  mine  own  whim,  nor 
did  X  act  hastily,  nor  in  anger. 

"  Snares,  nets  and  traps  of  every  kind,  either  open  or  con- 
cealed, are  used  to  catch  innumerable  wild  beasts,  whether 
they  be  fleeing  in  terror,  or,  unafraid,  are  standing  still. 
Whether  these  beasts  are  maddened  with  fear  or  no,  they 
who  feed  on  flesh  run  them  through  without  pity  while  their 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

back  is  turned ;  it  does  not  seem  to  me  that  they  are  at  fault. 
In  this  world,  even  royal  Rishis,  versed  in  their  duty,  indulge 
in  the  chase.  This  is  why,  with  a  single  arrow,  I  struck  thee 
down  while  engaged  in  combat  with  thy  brother,  O  Monkey. 
What  boots  it,  whether  thou  didst  enter  into  combat  with  me 
or  no,  since  thou  art  but  a  monkey. 

"  Unquestionably  it  is  kings  who  dispense  the  unwritten 
law  and  happiness  in  life,  O  Best  of  Monkeys !  One  should 
never  reproach  them,  nor  address  them  disrespectfully,  nor 
disregard  them ;  they  are  Gods  who,  assuming  human  form, 
dwell  on  earth !  But  thou  in  thine  ignorance  of  the  law, 
dominated  by  anger,  didst  insult  me,  who  have  ever  conformed 
to  the  established  tradition  of  mine  ancestors." 

Hearing  Rama's  words,  Bali,  deeply  mortified,  no  longer 
sought  to  denounce  the  son  of  Raghu,  the  task  of  duty  now 
having  been  rendered  clear  to  him,  and  with  joined  palms 
that  King  of  the  Monkeys  answered  him,  saying : — 

"  Undoubtedly,  O  First  of  Men,  what  thou  hast  uttered  is 
truth !  To  gainsay  an  eminent  personage  is  not  permitted  to 
one  who  is  of  common  stock.  It  was  in  ignorance  that  I 
formerly  addressed  thee  in  disrespectful  terms.  Do  not  hold 
it  against  me,  O  Raghava,  thou  who  art  conversant  with  the 
significance  and  implication  of  things  and  devoted  to  the 
welfare  of  all.  In  the  serenity  of  thine  understanding,  that 
nothing  disturbs,  the  working  out  of  cause  and  effect  are  known 
to  thee.  O  Thou  whose  speech  accords  with  justice  and 
who  art  conversant  with  duty,  rescue  me  who  am  fallen  and 
the  first  of  those  to  transgress  the  law." 

In  a  voice  strangled  with  sobs,  Bali,  groaning,  expressed 
himself  with  laboured  effort,  his  eyes  fixed  on  Rama,  and 
resembled  an  elephant  sinking  in  a  morass. 

"  I  am  not  concerned  for  myself  or  Tara  or  my  relatives, 
as  much  as  for  my  virtuous  son,  Angada,  of  golden  bracelets. 
Beholding  me  no  more,  that  unfortunate  one,  who  has  been 
so  cherished  from  childhood,  will  pine  away  with  grief,  like  a 
pool  whose  waters  have  dried  up.  He  is  yet  young  and  his 
understanding  has  not  yet  matured;  he  is  my  only  son  and 
most  dear  to  me.  Tara  is  his  mother,  O  Rama;  do  thou 
protect  that  powerful  Angada. 

213 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Show  extreme  kindness  to  Sugriva  and  Angada ;  be  their 
guardian  and  their  guide,  O  Thou  who  art  fully  conversant 
with  the  laws  of  righteousness  and  unrighteousness.  What 
thou  wouldst  perform  for  Bharata  and  Lakshmana,  do  for 
Sugriva  and  Angada. 

"  See  that  Sugriva  does  not  hold  the  sagacious  Tara  re- 
sponsible for  the  fault  I  have  committed  or  fail  to  treat  her 
with  respect.  Under  thy  protection,  let  him  govern  the 
kingdom  and,  living  obedient  to  thy  counsels,  he  will  attain 
heaven  as  well  as  rule  the  earth.  As  for  myself,  despite  Tara's 
words,  I  wished  to  receive  death  at  thine  hands  and  came 
forth  to  enter  into  a  duel  with  my  brother  Sugriva." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Rama,  the  now  humble  King  of  the 
Monkeys  became  silent. 

Then  Rama  consoled  Bali  who  was  still  fully  conscious  and 
spoke  to  him  in  a  gentle  voice,  expressing  the  essence  of 
spiritual  and  secular  wisdom,  saying : — 

"  Have  no  anxiety  either  on  our  behalf  or  thine  own,  O 
Best  of  Monkeys.  We  know  what  should  be  done,  above  all 
in  that  which  concerns  thee.  He  who  punishes  the  guilty 
and  he  who  is  guilty  and  pays  the  penalty  have  both  fulfilled 
the  purpose  of  cause  and  effect  and  therefore  eschew  calamity. 
Thus,  thanks  to  the  punishment  that  frees  them  from  all  taint, 
they  regain  their  immaculate  nature  by  the  very  path  which 
paved  the  way  to  the  penalty. 

"  Put  away  grief,  bewilderment  and  fear  with  which  thine 
heart  is  filled ;  thou  canst  not  avoid  thy  fate,  O  Chief  of  the 
Monkeys.  What  Angada  was  to  thee,  O  King  of  the  Monkeys, 
he  will  be  to  Sugriva  and  myself;  do  not  doubt  it." 

The  magnanimous  Rama,  intrepid  in  combat,  uttered  these 
words  full  of  tenderness  and  benignity,  in  accord  with  righteous- 
ness, and  the  dweller  in  the  forest  answered  him  humbly, 
saying: — 

"  Pierced  by  thine  arrow,  my  mind  bewildered,  I  insulted 
thee  without  knowing  what  I  was  doing,  O  Lord,  Thou  whose 
immeasurable  valour  is  equal  to  Mahendra's  1  Be  pacified  and 
pardon  me,  O  Veritable  Sovereign  of  the  Monkeys."

Tarays  Grief 

The  mighty  King  of  the  Monkeys,  who  lay  pierced  by  an 
arrow,  did  not  reply  further  to  Rama's  judicious  words.  His 
limbs  crushed  by  rocks,  severly  bruised  by  the  trees  that 
Sugriva  had  hurled  at  him,  transfixed  by  Rama's  shaft,  at  the 
point  of  death,  he  swooned  away. 

Tara,  learning  that  he  had  been  struck  down  by  an  arrow 
discharged  by  Rama  in  the  struggle  and  receiving  the  dis- 
tressing tidings  that  her  lord  lay  dying,  with  a  troubled  heart 
hastily  emerged  with  her  son  from  the  rocky  cavern.  The 
monkeys  who  followed  Angada,  however,  on  seeing  Rama 
with  his  bow,  ran  away  in  fear. 

Perceiving  those  monkeys  fleeing  in  terror,  like  deer  that 
scatter  when  the  leader  of  the  herd  falls  dead,  Tara,  though 
herself  distraught,  rallied  the  frightened  monkeys,  who  sought 
to  escape  from  Rama,  as  if  his  shafts  had  already  been  dis- 
charged at  them,  and  said : — 

"  O  Monkeys,  you  are  the  servants  of  that  Lion  among 
Monarchs  ;  why  are  you  abandoning  all  and  flying  in  disorder? 
Has  Bali  not  been  laid  low  by  his  wicked  brother  on  account 
of  the  throne  ?  It  was  from  afar  that  Rama  loosed  his  far- 
reaching  arrow !  *' 

Thus  did  the  consort  of  Bali  speak,  and  those  monkeys, 
who  were  able  to  change  their  shape  at  will,  answered  with 
one  voice  in  words  fitting  to  the  occasion,  saying : — 

"  O  Thou,  who  art  the  mother  of  a  living  son,  return  home 
and  protect  Angada !  Death,  in  the  form  of  Rama,  has  struck 
Bali  down  and  is  bearing  him  away.  Having  launched  a 
volley  of  immense  trees  and  great  rocks,  Bali  fell,  borne  down 
by  arrows  that  resembled  the  lightning.  Beholding  that  Lion 
among  Monkeys  overcome,  him  whose  prowess  was  equal  to 
IndrVs,  the  whole  army  of  monkeys  has  taken  to  flight.  Let 
the  warriors  save  the  city  and  install  Angada  as  king !  The 
215 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

monkeys  will  obey  Bali's  son,  who  will  take  his  place.  If 
these  conditions  do  not  meet  with  thine  approval,  O  Lady  of 
agreeable  looks,  then  the  monkeys  will  seek  other  inaccessible 
retreats.  Amongst  those  who  live  in  the  forest,  some  have  no 
wives,  others  have  common  wives,  but  we  fear  those  who 
have  been  deprived  of  their  wives  and  still  desire  them."1 

As  they  were  but  a  short  distance  away,  that  Lady  of  Sweet 
Smiles  heard  them  and  answered  with  dignity,  saying : — 

"  Since  that  Lion  among  Monkeys  is  dying,  of  what  use  to 
me  is  my  son  or  the  entire  kingdom  ?  I  shall  seek  out  the  feet 
of  that  magnanimous  hero  whom  Rama  has  slain  with  a  single 
arrow." 

Speaking  thus,  overcome  with  grief,  beating  her  head  and 
breast  with  her  two  hands  and  weeping,  in  her  distress  she 
rushed  towards  him  and,  still  running,  beheld  her  lord  lying 
on  the  earth,  he,  the  slayer  of  the  foremost  of  monkeys,  who 
never  turned  back  in  battle ;  he,  who  was  able  to  hurl  great 
mountains,  as  Vasava  discharges  his  thunderbolt  with  all  the 
fury  of  a  storm,  roaring  the  while  like  a  great  mass  of  thunder, 
clouds;  he  whose  valour  was  equal  to  Shakra's ;  that  hero 
pierced  by  a  single  arrow,  lay  on  the  earth,  like  the  leader  of 
antelopes  a  tiger  has  struck  down  for  its  prey,  or  like  a  place  of 
sacrifice,  held  sacred  by  all,  with  its  banners  and  its  altars  laid 
waste  by  Suparna  on  account  of  a  serpent. 

Then  Tara  beheld  the  mighty  Rama  leaning  on  his  bow, 
standing  with  his  younger  brother  and  the  brother  of  her  lord, 
and,  beside  herself  with  grief,  she  approached  her  spouse, 
who  had  fallen  on  the  battlefield  and,  seeing  him  lying  there, 
was  overcome  by  distress  and  fell  to  the  ground.  Then, 
rising  as  if  newly  waking  from  sleep,  seeing  her  lord  caught 
in  the  noose  of  death,  sobbing,  she  cried  out :   "  O  King !  " 

Her  piercing  cries,  resembling  an  osprey's,  moved  Sugriva 
deeply,  as  did  the  presence  of  Angada  also.

CHAPTER    20 

Her  Lamentations 

Seeing  her  lord  lying  on  the  earth,  pierced  by  that  death- 
dealing  arrow  discharged  by  Rama,  Tara,  whose  face  resembled 
the  moon,  approaching  him,  embraced  him.  At  the  sight  of 
Bali,  who  lay  like  an  elephant  wounded  by  an  arrow,  that 
monkey  resembling  a  huge  mountain  or  an  uprooted  tree,  Tara 
poured  out  her  heart,  torn  with  grief,  in  lamentation  : — 

"  O  Thou  who  wert  full  of  valour  in  combat !  O  Hero  !  O 
Best  of  Monkeys !  It  is  because  of  my  recent  importunities 
that  thou  wilt  not  now  speak  to  me !  Rise,  O  Lion  among 
Monkeys  and  rest  on  a  comfortable  couch !  Those  great 
monarchs,  thine  equals,  do  not  sleep  on  the  earth ;  or  is  the 
earth  thy  cherished  love,  since  even  in  dying  thou  dost  lie 
by  her  and  scornest  me  ? 

"  Without  doubt,  O  Warrior,  thanks  to  thy  great  exploits, 
thou  hast  founded  another  and  more  glorious  Kishkindha  in 
heaven !  The  pleasures  we  once  shared  in  the  woods  and  in 
the  fragrant  bowers  are  henceforth  at  an  end.  I  am  bereft 
of  all  joy  and  hope  and  sunk  in  a  sea  of  sorrow,  since  thou,  the 
King  of  Kings,  art  returning  to  the  five  elements.1  My  heart 
must  be  made  of  stone,  since,  seeing  thee  lying  on  the  earth, 
grief  does  not  cause  it  to  break  into  a  thousand  pieces.  Thou 
didst  steal  away  Sugriva's  consort  and  sent  him  into  exile ; 
it  is  the  fruit  of  this  double  fault  that  thou  art  now  expiating, 
O  Chief  of  the  Monkeys  ! 

"Intent  on  thy  welfare,  I  submitted  to  thy  senseless  re- 
proaches ;  I,  who  in  the  desire  to  be  of  service  to  thee  gave 
thee  nought  but  wise  counsel,  O  Indra  of  Monkeys !  Now, 
O  Proud  Lord,  beguiled  by  their  youthful  and  seductive  beauty, 
thou  art  moving  the  hearts  of  the  Apsaras.  It  is  irrevocable  fate 
which  this  day  has  put  an  end  to  thine  existence ;  thou  whom 
Sugriva  could  not  vanquish  hast  resigned  thyself  to  its  power  !

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Having  without  cause  struck  down  Bali  who  was  engaged 
in  combat  with  another,  though  it  is  censurable,  Kakutstha 
has  no  regrets.  I  who,  till  now,  did  not  know  distress,  de- 
prived of  thy  support,  at  the  height  of  misfortune,  must  pass 
my  life  as  a  widow.  What  will  the  fate  of  Angada  be,  the 
object  of  my  tenderness,  a  valiant  though  youthful  prince 
accustomed  to  pleasure,  now  at  the  mercy  of  his  paternal  uncle, 
who  is  filled  with  anger  against  us  ?  Look  long  on  thy  virtuous 
Sire,  O  My  Beloved  Son !   Soon  thou  shalt  see  him  no  more. 

"  And  Thou,  O  comfort  thy  son,  give  him  counsel,  em- 
bracing his  brow  before  thou  departest  on  thy  last  journey ! 
Assuredly  Rama  has  accomplished  a  great  feat  in  striking  thee 
down,  but  he  is  guiltless,  for  all  he  did  was  to  obey  Sugriva. 
O  Sugriva,  rejoice,  regain  possession  of  Ruma  and  enjoy  the 
kingdom  without  hindrance ;  thy  brother,  thine  adversary,  is 
wounded  unto  death. 

"  But  Thou,  O  My  Beloved,  why  dost  thou  not  answer  my 
complaint  ?  See,  thy  numerous  and  lovely  wives  surround  thee, 

0  King  of  the  Monkeys." 

Hearing  Tara's  lamentations,  those  unfortunate  women, 
placing  Angada  in  their  midst,  emitted  pitiful  cries  on  every 
side.    Then  Tara  spoke  once  again,  saying : — 

"  How  canst  thou  abandon  Angada,  O  Thou  whose  powerful 
arms  are  decorated  with  bracelets,  and  go  forth  on  thy  last 
journey  thus  ?  It  is  not  meet  to  abandon  a  son  who  possesses 
thy  virtues  and  is  aimiable  and  handsome.    If  inadvertently 

1  have  offended  thee,  O  long-armed  Hero,  then  forgive  me  ! 
0  Chief  of  the  Monkey  Tribe,  I  lay  my  head  at  thy  feet." 

Thus  did  Tara  with  the  other  queens  lament  bitterly  at  the 
side  of  her  lord  and  that  lady  of  matchless  beauty  resolved  to 
die  of  hunger  lying  on  the  earth  at  Bali's  side. 


KISHKINDHA     KANDA 


CHAPTER     21 

HanumarCs  Speech 

Hanuman,  however,  the  Leader  of  the  Monkeys,  gently  tried 
to  console  Tara,  who  was  lying  on  the  earth  like  a  star  fallen 
from  the  heavens,  and  said : — 

"  The  fruits  of  all  that  is  done  under  the  impulse  of  virtue  or 
vice  must  be  plucked  after  death,  whether  they  be  good  or 
evil.  O  Unhappy  One,  for  whom  dost  thou  weep  ?  O 
Unfortunate  One,  whom  dost  thou  bewail  ?  For  whose  life, 
that  bubble,  should  one  mourn?  Henceforth  the  youthful 
Angada  should  be  the  object  of  thy  solicitude,  since  he  alone 
survives.  From  now  on,  thou  shouldst  concern  thyself  on  his 
account  and  render  him  fitting  service.  Thou  knowest  well 
how  uncertain  is  the  future  of  all  beings ;  therefore  it  is  for 
thee  to  perform  noble  deeds  here,  who  art  conversant  with 
thy  duty  and  who  art  a  stranger  to  common  acts ! 

"  He  under  whom  hundreds  and  thousands  of  monkeys 
lived  has  now  reached  the  uttermost  bourne  of  his  destiny, 
and  since  he  fulfilled  the  injunctions  laid  down  by  the  law  and 
was  distinguished  for  his  impartiality,  his  liberality  and  bis 
tolerance,  he  now  dwells  among  the  virtuous  conquerors. 
Why  shouldst  thou  mourn  for  him  ?  O  Irreproachable  One, 
thou  hast  now  become  the  protectress  of  all  the  leading  monkeys, 
thy  son,  and  also  this  kingdom  of  the  apes  and  bears.  Little 
by  little  do  thou  console  these  two  (Sugriva  and  Angada)  who 
are  afflicted,  and  under  thy  tutelage,  O  Fair  Lady,  let  Angada 
rule  the  earth. 

"To  ensure  the  future  and  reflect  on  the  present  is  the 
whole  duty  of  a  prince ;  it  is  so  decreed  by  destiny.  Angada 
should  be  installed  as  King  of  the  Monkeys  and  be  anointed. 
Seeing  thy  son  seated  on  the  throne,  thy  peace  of  mind  will 
be  restored." 

Hearing  these  words,  Tara,  who  was  torn  with  grief  on 
account  of  her  lord,  answered  Hanuman,  who  stood  at  her 
side,  saying  :— 

219 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  I  would  rather  cling  to  the  body  of  this  hero  than  a  hundred 
sons  like  Angada.  I  am  not  able  to  govern  the  monkeys  nor 
is  he;  such  a  duty  devolves  on  his  paternal  uncle,  Sugriva. 
O  Hanuman,  it  is  not  for  me  to  confer  the  kingdom  on  Angada ; 
the  true  relative  of  the  son  in  succession  to  Ins  father  is  the  uncle, 
who  stands  as  a  second  father  to  him  and  not  the  mother,  O 
Foremost  of  Monkeys.  There  is  nought  better  for  me  in  this 
world  or  in  the  next  than  to  take  refuge  near  the  King  of  the 
Monkeys,  my  lord ;  it  is  fitting  for  me  to  share  the  bed  of  him 
who  has  fallen  facing  the  foe." 


CHAPTER    22 

Bali's  last  Words 

Bali,  whose  breathing  was  scarcely  perceptible  and  who  was 
sighing  faintly,  glanced  round  and  discerned  his  younger 
brother,  Sugriva,  before  him.  Addressing  him  whose  victory 
had  assured  him  of  the  possession  of  the  dominion  of  the 
monkeys,  he  spoke  in  clear  and  affectionate  tones,  saying  : — 

"  O  Sugriva,  do  not  approach  me  with  any  evil  intent,  I 
who  was  carried  away  by  a  fatal  loss  of  understanding.  It 
would  seem  to  me,  O  My  Friend,  that  it  was  not  our  destiny 
to  live  at  peace  with  one  another ;  though  friendship  is  natural 
between  brothers,  yet  with  us  it  has  been  different.  To-day, 
thou  wilt  regain  the  kingdom  of  the  forest-dwellers,  whereas 
I,  mark  well,  am  leaving  this  world  and  going  to  the  region  of 
death.  Not  only  am  I  abandoning  in  an  instant,  life,  kingdom 
and  great  prosperity  but  also  a  reputation  without  stain.  At 
this  supreme  moment,  I  make  an  appeal  to  thee  and,  difficult 
though  it  is,  it  must  be  done,  O  Valiant  Prince. 

"  See,  stretched  on  the  earth,  his  face  bathed  in  tears, 
Angada,  who  is  worthy  of  happiness,  brought  up  in  luxury 
and,  though  a  child,  possessing  nought  that  pertains  to  child- 
hood !  Do  thou  protect  him  from  all  peril,  he  who  is  my  son 
and  dearer  to  me  than  life,  the  issue  of  my  loins  and  whom 
I  now  abandon,  though  he  does  not  merit  abandonment.    Be 


KISHKINDHA     KANDA 

his  father,  his  benefactor  and  his  guardian  in  all  circumstances 
and  in  danger  be  his  refuge,  as  I  have  ever  been,  O  Chief 
of  the  Monkeys  ! 

"  Born  of  Tara,  that  fortunate  prince,  thine  equal  in  valour, 
shall  precede  thee  in  the  destruction  of  the  titans.  That 
youthful  Angada,  Tara's  son,  that  valiant  hero,  whose  prowess 
is  great,  will  manifest  it  in  deeds  of  valour  worthy  of  me. 
Further,  when  the  daughter  of  Sushena  (Tara),  of  profound 
discernment  and  conversant  with  future  happenings,  bids  thee 
saying :  *  Do  this,  it  is  right ',  do  so  without  hesitation. 
There  is  no  presentiment  of  Tara's  that  does  not  come  to  pass. 

"  Whatever  Raghava  proposes,  do  thou  carry  out  with  the 
same  resolution ;  it  were  wrong  to  disobey  him  and  he  will 
punish  thee  for  thy  contempt.  Take  this  golden  chain,  O 
Sugriva ;  the  glorious  Shri  who  dwells  in  it  will  leave  it  at 
my  death."1 

Hearing  Bali's  affectionate  and  brotherly  words,  Sugriva  was 
bereft  of  joy  and  grew  sad,  resembling  the  moon  in  eclipse. 
Pacified  by  Bali  and  anxious  to  act  in  a  fitting  manner,  on  his 
brother's  request,  he  took  off  the  golden  chain. 

Having  thus  made  over  this  mark  of  royalty,  Bali,  at  the 
point  of  death,  gazing  on  his  son  Angada,  who  stood  before 
him,  addressed  him  tenderly,  saying : — 

"  Do  thou  act  in  a  manner  fitting  to  the  time  and  place. 
Suffer  pleasure  and  pain  with  equanimity ;  in  joy  and  sorrow 
be  obedient  to  Sugriva.  Assuredly,  O  Long-armed  Warrior, 
thou  hast  ever  been  cherished  by  me,  but  it  is  not  by  living 
thus  that  thou  wilt  earn  Sugriva's  respect.  Do  not  ally  thyself 
with  those  who  are  not  his  friends,  still  less  his  foes,  O  Conqueror 
of  Thine  Enemies  !  Be  loyal  to  Sugriva,  thy  master,  with  thy 
senses  fully  controlled  and  ever  be  attentive  to  his  interests. 
Be  not  inordinately  attached  to  any  nor  hold  any  in  contempt ; 
both  extremes  are  a  great  error,  therefore  pursue  the  middle 
course."  With  these  words,  suffering  intensely  from  the  arrow, 
his  eyes  staring  wildly,  his  great  teeth  chattering,  Bali  expired. 

Then  a  great  tumult  arose  among  the  monkeys,  thus  deprived 
of  their  leader,  and  all  the  forest  dwellers  gave  vent  to  lamenta- 
tions, saying : — 

1  Shri  or  Lakshmi,  the  Consort  of  Vishnu  and  Goddess  of  Prosperity. 
321 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Henceforth  Kishkiiidha  is  nought  but  a  desert,  the  King 
of  Monkeys  having  ascended  to  heaven ;  his  gardens  are  but 
a  wilderness,  as  are  the  mountains  and  the  woods.  That  Lion 
of  Monkeys  has  passed  away ;  the  forest-dwellers  are  stripped 
of  their  glory. 

"  He  engaged  the  illustrious  and  long-armed  Golaba,  the 
Gandharva,  in  a  terrible  battle  lasting  ten  years  and  yet  another 
five ;  that  struggle  did  not  cease  day  or  night ;  then  in  the 
sixteenth  year,  Golaba  was  struck  down,  that  foolhardy  one 
falling  under  the  blows  of  Bali  of  strong  teeth.  How  has  he 
who  protected  us  from  all  peril  fallen  in  his  turn  ? 

"  That  valiant  Leader  of  Monkeys  being  slain,  the  forest- 
dwellers  will  not  be  able  to  find  any  safe  place  of  refuge,  like 
kine  in  the  midst  of  a  lion-infested  forest." 

On  hearing  these  words,  Tara,  who  was  submerged  in  an 
ocean  of  grief,  gazing  on  the  face  of  her  dead  lord,  fell  to  the 
earth,  embracing  Bali  like  a  creeper  clinging  to  an  uprooted  tree. 


CHAPTER    23 

Tara  weeps  over  the  Body  of  Bali 

Thereupon,  smelling  the  face1  of  that  King  of  the  Monkeys, 
Tara,  who  was  renowned  throughout  the  whole  world,  addressed 
her  dead  consort,  saying : — 

"  Not  having  followed  my  counsel,  O  Warrior,  thou  art  now 
stretched  on  the  rough,  hard  and  stony  ground.  Hast  thou 
then  chosen  the  earth  as  thy  love  rather  than  myself,  since 
thou  now  liest  embracing  it,  whereas  to  me  thou  dost  not 
utter  a  single  word  ? 

"  Alas !  Fate  has  favoured  Sugriva,  that  valiant  One,  whose 
noble  exploits  will  now  cause  him  to  be  regarded  as  a  hero. 
The  Leaders  of  the  Bears  and  Monkeys  pay  homage  to  thy 
prowess !    Hearing  their  cries  of  distress  and  those  of  the

KISHKINDHA     KANDA 

unfortunate  Angada  and  myself,  why  dost  thou  not  wake? 
Having  been  slain  in  combat,  thou  sleepest  on  that  hard  bed, 
the  place  where  formerly  thine  enemies  rested  struck  down 
by  thy  blows.  O  My  Beloved,  thou  art  the  offshoot  of  a 
glorious  race  renowned  for  its  heroism ;  thou,  for  whom  war 
was  but  a  sport,  art  gone,  leaving  me  alone  without  a  protector, 
O  Proud  Monarch !  Nay,  a  wise  man  should  never  give  his 
daughter  in  marriage  to  a  warrior.  Mark  how  I,  wedded  to 
a  Kshatriya,  am  about  to  die,  having  been  made  a  widow. 
My  pride  is  humbled,  and  from  this  moment  the  path  to  ever- 
lasting life  is  closed  to  me.  I  am  submerged  in  an  ocean  of 
grief  without  ground  or  bourne !  How  hard  is  my  heart  that, 
even  seeing  my  dead  lord,  it  does  not  break  into  a  thousand 
fragments — my  friend,  my  lord,  naturally  dear  to  me,  that  hero, 
who,  falling  on  the  field  of  honour  under  the  blows  of  a  warrior 
more  powerful  than  he,  has  returned  to  the  five  elements. 
The  woman  who  loses  her  consort,  even  if  she  have  sons 
and  be  endowed  with  wealth,  is  yet  a  widow,  say  the  wise. 

0  Hero  !  Thou  art  lying  enveloped  in  the  blood  that  flows  from 
thy  limbs,  as  thou  wert  formerly  with  the  scarlet  silk  of  thy 
couch.    Dust  and  gore  covers  thy  body  on  every  side,  so  that 

1  cannot  hold  thee  in  mine  arms,  O  Bull  amongst  Plavagas. 

"  To-day,  Sugriva  has  achieved  the  purpose  for  which  he 
engaged  thee  in  this  formidable  struggle.  A  single  arrow 
discharged  by  Rama  freed  him  from  all  fear.  That  shaft  that 
pierced  thine  heart  now  prevents  me  from  embracing  thy 
body  and  I  can  but  gaze  on  thee,  who  art  rejoining  the  five 
elements." 

At  that  moment  the  General  Nala  drew  out  from  the  corpse 
the  arrow  which  resembled  an  angry  snake  issuing  from  a 
mountain  cave  and  glittered  as  he  withdrew  it,  like  the  sun 
whose  rays  have  been  intercepted  by  the  peak  of  a  mountain. 
Thereupon  streams  of  blood  instantly  began  to  flow  again 
from  those  wounds  on  every  side,  resembling  the  water  of  a 
river  that  is  stained  by  the  sandstone  washed  down  from  a 
mountain. 

Tara,  wiping  off  the  dust  of  combat  with  which  he  was 
soiled,  washed  her  brave  lord  with  the  tears  that  welled  up 
in  her  eyes,  while  she  gazed  lovingly  down  on  him  lying  there, 
223 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

pierced  by  Rama's  arrow,  his  limbs  all  covered  with  blood. 
Then,  addressing  her  son  Angada,  whose  eyes  were  red,  she 
said  to  him : — 

"  Behold  the  bitter  end  of  thy  sire,  O  My  Son  !  How  tragic 
it  is !  This  is  the  outcome  of  an  hostility  born  of  perfidy ! 
This  body,  gleaming  like  the  sun  about  to  rise,  has  entered 
the  region  of  death.  Embrace  that  proud  monarch,  O  My 
Son !  " 

At  these  words,  Angada  rising,  seized  hold  of  the  feet  of 
his  father  with  his  rounded  arms,  saying : — "  It  is  I,  Angada  ! 
When  I  embraced  thee  formerly  thou  didst  say  *  Live  long, 
O  My  Son ',  why  dost  thou  not  speak  to  me  thus  now  ?  " 

Then  Tata  said : — "  Here  I  stand  beside  thine  inanimate 
body,  like  a  cow  with  its  calf  beside  a  bull  that  a  lion  has  just 
slain  !  I  do  not  see  the  gift  that  the  King  of  the  Gods  bestowed 
on  thee  when  gratified  by  his  victory  over  the  Asura,  that 
glorious  chain  of  gold,  why  is  this  ?  Thou  shalt  not  be  robbed 
of  the  insignia  of  royalty  even  after  death,  O  Proud  Monarch, 
for  the  King  of  the  Mountains  continues  to  glow  after  the 
sun  has  set. 

"  Thou  didst  not  follow  my  sage  counsel  and  I  was  unable 
to  restrain  thee.  Thy  death  on  the  battlefield  has  brought 
about  mine  own  and  my  son's  also.  The  Goddess  of  Prosperity1 
has  renounced  both  thee  and  me." 


chapter   24 

Sugriva's  Remorse 

Seeing  Tara  submerged  in  the  fathomless  ocean  of  grief,  Bali's 
younger  brother  was  filled  with  remorse  for  his  tragic  end  and 
overcome  with  distress,  his  face  bathed  in  tears,  in  her  presence, 
slowly  approached  Rama  surrounded  by  his  attendants. 

Raghava,  bearing  all  the  marks  of  royalty,  stood  apart,  full 
of  dignity  and  majesty,  bearing  his  bow  and  arrows,  which 
resembled  serpents,  in  his  hands.

had  bestowed  on  Bali.

Then  Sugriva  addressed  him,  saying : — "  In  accord 
with  thy  promise,  O  Indra  among  Men,  thou  didst  accom- 
plish this  deed,  the  results  of  which  are  here  made  manifest. 
In  the  midst  of  my  triumph,  O  Prince,  in  the  presence  of  the 
slain,  my  spirit  is  troubled.  On  account  of  the  dead  monarch, 
his  chief  queen  is  wailing  piteously,  the  city  is  giving  vent  to 
lamentation  and  Angada  is  plunged  in  affliction ;  all  this, 
O  Rama,  robs  sovereignty  of  any  delight  for  me. 

'*  At  first,  anger,  resentment  and  extreme  vexation  caused 
me  to  view  the  death  of  my  brother  with  satisfaction,  but  soon, 
in  the  presence  of  the  corpse  of  that  King  of  the  Monkeys, 
a  great  sadness  seized  me,  O  First  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku. 
Now  it  is  made  clear  to  me  that  it  would  have  been  better 
to  continue  to  live  as  I  formerly  did  on  the  lofty  summit  of 
the  Rishyamuka  mountain,  than  slay  my  brother. 

" '  I  have  no  desire  to  destroy  thee !  Begone !  *  were  the 
words  that  magnanimous  warrior  addressed  to  me.  This 
utterance  was  worthy  of  him,  O  Rama,  and  I,  by  killing  him, 
have  acted  vilely.  How  can  any,  even  if  he  be  devoid  of 
virtue,  approve  the  murder  of  a  brother  or  balance  the  happiness 
experienced  on  attaining  a  kingdom  with  the  grief  suffered 
by  his  death.  Unquestioningly  he  had  no  intention  of  slaying 
me,  being  too  great  of  soul,  but  in  my  perversity  I  have  robbed 
him  of  his  life. 

"  In  the  struggle,  when,  under  the  blows  of  the  trees,  I  was 
about  to  succumb  and  cried  out,  he  at  once  reassured  me, 
saying :  '  Do  not  repeat  thine  impudence ;  go  hence ! ' 

"  He  was  ever  filled  with  brotherly  affection,  nobility  and 
justice,  whereas  I  was  full  of  anger,  envy  and  the  natural 
characteristics  of  a  monkey. 

"  That  which  should  be  excluded  from  one's  thoughts, 
feelings,  desires  and  conduct  is  what  I  have  harboured  in 
murdering  my  brother,  a  crime  equal  to  the  slaying  of  Vish- 
warupa  by  Indra.  But  Indra's  guilt  was  shared  by  the  earth, 
the  trees  and  the  waters  as  well  as  women,  whereas  who  is 
able  to  share  mine  ?  Who  would  wish  to  bear  the  weight  of 
the  sin  of  a  Deer  of  the  Trees  ? 

"  I  am  not  worthy  to  be  held  in  honour  by  the  people,  nor 
to  be  allied  to  the  kingdom,  still  less  do  I  merit  the  throne, 
225 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

having  committed  such  an  infamous  deed  that  entails  the 
destruction  of  one  of  mine  own  race. 

"  I  have  perpetrated  a  vile  and  ignoble  act,  condemned  by 
the  whole  world.  An  overwhelming  sorrow  fills  me,  as  torren- 
tial rain  fills  a  ravine.  I  am  crushed  by  the  bank  of  a  river 
that  has  been  trodden  down  by  an  intoxicated  elephant,  whose 
back  and  tail  are  the  murder  of  my  blood-brother,  whose 
trunk,  eyes,  head  and  tusks  are  the  remorse  bearing  me  away. 

"  This  sin,  the  weight  of  which  is  intolerable,  O  Prince, 
O  Son  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  has  destroyed  all  that  is  best  in 
my  heart,  as  fire  consumes  gold,  leaving  only  dross.  The 
company  of  the  great  leaders  of  monkeys,  O  Prince,  are  half 
dead  through  my  fault  and  also  on  account  of  the  violent 
despair  of  Angada. 

'*  Rare  indeed  is  a  son  as  obedient  as  Angada,  but  a  son  is 
easily  acquired ;  where  however  in  the  world  can  one  akin  to 
a  blood  brother  be  found,  O  Hero  ?  To-day,  if  Angada,  that 
Chief  of  Warriors,  and  his  mother  live,  she,  though  overcome 
with  grief  will  surely  care  for  him,  for  bereft  of  him  she  would 
die.  As  for  me,  I  wish  to  enter  the  blazing  pyre  in  order  to 
regain  the  affection  of  my  brother  and  his  son. 

"  Those  leaders  of  monkeys  will  set  out  in  search  of  Sita 
whenever  thou  commandest.  O  Son  of  that  Indra  among 
Men,  I,  the  Destroyer  of  my  Race,  who  am  no  longer  worthy 
to  live  after  committing  this  outrage,  bid  thee  farewell,  O  Rama." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  wretched  Sugriva,  Bali's  brother, 
that  noble  descendant  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  Rama,  began 
to  weep,  he,  the  Destroyer  of  Hostile  Armies,  for  his  mind  was 
troubled.  Thereafter,  glancing  here  and  there,  that  support 
of  the  earth,  the  protector  of  the  world,  Rama,  in  the  midst 
of  his  distress,  observed  Tara  groaning  under  the  load  of  her 
affliction. 

The  chief  queen  of  that  Lion  among  Monkeys,  of  lovely  eyes, 
was  lying  beside  her  lord,  whom  she  held  in  her  arms.  Then 
the  first  of  the  ministers  raised  up  that  valiant  consort  of  the 
King  of  the  Monkeys,  and  she,  trembling  as  they  separated  her 
from  her  lord,  whom  she  was  embracing,  beheld  Rama,  whose 
radiance  equalled  the  sun's,  standing  with  his  bow  and  arrows 
in  his  hand. 

226 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

Adorned  with  all  the  distinguishing  marks  of  royalty,  that 
large-eyed  prince,  whom  she  had  never  yet  beheld,  that  first 
of  heroes,  was  recognized  by  Tara,  whose  eyes  resembled  a 
doe's,  and  she  reflected  '  It  is  Kakutstha ! ' 

Then  that  noble  and  unfortunate  lady,  who  had  so  suddenly 
been  plunged  into  affliction,  tottering,  approached  the  one 
who  was  the  equal  of  Indra,  inaccessible  and  all  powerful. 
The  venerable  Tara,  her  beautiful  frame  wasted  with  grief, 
drawing  near  to  the  pure-souled  Rama,  who  by  his  valour 
ever  attained  his  end  in  combat,  addressed  him  thus  : — 

"  Thou  art  of  immeasurable  courage,  unapproachable,  master 
of  thy  senses  and  of  supreme  faith ;  thy  fame  is  imperishable, 
thou  art  full  of  wisdom  and  the  support  of  the  earth  !  Thine 
eyes  are  the  colour  of  blood ;  thou  bearest  a  bow  and  arrows 
in  thine  hand ;  thou  art  endowed  with  great  strength  and 
strong  limbs  ;  thou  hast  renounced  the  concerns  of  the  body 
in  this  world  in  order  to  enjoy  divine  attributes.  The  shaft 
with  which  thou  didst  pierce  my  beloved  lord,  now  use  to 
destroy  me  also.  When  I  am  dead,  I  shall  be  reunited  to 
him;  without  me,  Bali  will  never  be  happy,  O  Hero.  Far 
from  me,  even  in  heaven,  amidst  the  red-haired  Apsaras, 
whose  locks  are  braided  in  various  ways  and  who  are  gor- 
geously attired,  he  will  not  be  happy,  O  Thou  whose  eyes 
resemble  the  pure  petals  of  the  lotus. 

"  Thou  knowest  well  that  he  who  is  separated  from  his 
loved  one  is  wretched !  On  account  of  this,  slay  me,  so  that 
Bali  shall  not  suffer  in  mine  absence.  If,  in  the  greatness  of 
thy  soul,  thou  shouldst  reflect  *  I  will  not  be  guilty  of  slaying 
a  woman ',  say  to  thyself,  *  She  is  part  of  Bali  himself '  and 
strike  me  down.  It  will  not  be  a  woman  whom  thou  hast  put 
to  death,  O  Son  of  that  Indra  among  Men !  By  virtue  of  the 
law  and  according  to  the  different  Vedic  texts,  women  are  not 
other  than  the  higher  self  of  man.  Therefore  the  wise  say 
that  the  gift  of  a  woman  is  assuredly  the  greatest  of  gifts. 
In  this  wise  thou  dost  give  me  back  to  my  dear  one  in  order 
that  I  may  fulfil  my  duty  to  him,  O  Warrior ;  by  this  offering 
thou  shalt  not  incur  the  sin  of  slaying  me. 

"  Filled  with  sorrow,  bereft  of  support,  left  desolate,  thou 
shouldn'st  not  spare  my  life.  The  more  so  that  far  from  that 
227  Q 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

sagacious  Prince  of  Monkeys,  whose  joyful  gait  resembled  an 
elephant's,  with  his  glorious  golden  chain,  the  insigna  of 
supreme  majesty,  I  shall  not  live  long,  O  Prince." 

Thus  spoke  Tara,  and  in  order  to  consoleher,  the  magnanimous 
Lord  addressed  her  with  wisdom  and  understanding,  saying  : — 

"  O  Consort  of  a  Hero,  do  not  grieve  !  The  whole  universe 
is  ordered  by  the  creator ;  similarly  it  is  established  that  the 
sum  of  good  and  evil  is  ordained  by  Him,  nor  do  the  Three 
Worlds,  obedient  to  His  will,  transgress  His  fixed  laws.  Because 
of  this,  thou  wilt  attain  supreme  happiness  and  thy  son  become 
heir-apparent  to  the  kingdom.  The  Lord  has  ordained  this 
in  the  order  of  things  ;    the  consorts  of  heroes  do  not  complain." 

Thus  comforted  by  the  magnanimous  and  powerful  victor 
of  his  foes,  the  wife  of  the  valiant  Bali,  the  gorgeously-attired 
Tara,  ceased  to  lament. 


CHAPTER    25 

Bali's  Funeral  Rites 

Full  of  compassion  for  Sugriva's  distress  and  that  experienced 
by  Tara  and  Angada,  Kakutstha,  who  was  accompanied  by 
Lakshmana,  in  order  to  console  them,  said : — 

"  It  is  not  by  weeping  that  the  happiness  of  the  departed 
is  assured !  Cany  out  your  immediate  duty  without  delay  ! 
By  shedding  tears,  you  have  observed  the  demands  of  social 
convention;  it  is  vain  to  seek  to  avoid  fate.  Time1  is  the 
driving  force  that  orders  the  world's  events ;  it  is  Time  that 
creates  all  conditions  here  below.  None  is  the  real  agent  of 
action  and  none  truly  causes  action  to  take  place.  The  world 
abides  by  virtue  of  the  dictates  of  its  own  inner  being.  Time 
is  its  source,  stay  and  goal.  Time  does  not  overstep  its  own 
bounds,  nor  does  it  suffer  decrease.  Self-dependent,  there  is 
neither  kinship  nor  friendship  in  it,  nor  is  it  restrained  by  any, 
nor  has  it  any  cause.  Assuredly,  he  who  sees  clearly  is  aware 
of  the  working  of  Time.  Duty,  prosperity  and  pleasure  are 
subject  to  Time ;  it  is  on  this  account  that  Bali  attained  his 

1  Time  in  the  form  o(  Destiny. 

228

own  true  state.  The  King  of  the  Plavagas  has  reaped  the 
fruit  of  his  works,  acquired  by  his  merits,  through  his  integrity 
and  liberality.  He  has  attained  heaven  on  account  of  his 
observance  of  duty  and  he  has  taken  possession  of  it  by  sacri- 
ficing his  life.  The  Sovereign  of  the  Monkeys  has  reached 
the  highest  state.  Thou  hast  mourned  long  enough ;  now 
perform  the  last  rites." 

When  Rama  ceased  speaking,  Lakshmana,  the  Slayer  of 
His  Foes,  spoke  sagely  to  Sugriva,  who  was  distraught,  saying: — 

"  O  Sugriva,  inaugurate  the  obsequies  without  delay  with 
the  assistance  of  Tara  and  Angada.  Issue  the  order  that  a 
large  quantity  of  dry  wood  be  gathered  together  with  the 
sacred  sandalwood,  for  the  funeral  pyre.  Banish  indecision ; 
this  city  depends  on  thee.  Let  Angada  bring  garlands  and 
robes  of  every  kind,  together  with  butter,  oil,  perfumes  and 
all  that  is  requisite. 

"  O  Tara,  do  thou  find  a  palanquin  without  delay ;  prompt 
action  is  always  praiseworthy,  the  more  so  at  such  an  hour. 
Let  those  who  are  skilful  and  strong,  accustomed  to  palanquins, 
hold  themselves  in  readiness  to  bear  Bah  away." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Sugriva,  the  on  of  Sumitra,  Laksh- 
mana, the  Slayer  of  His  Foes,  took  up  his  position  beside  his 
brother. 

Hearing  Lakshmana's  command,  Tara  with  a  beating  heart 
hastened  to  the  cave,  bent  on  finding  a  litter,  and  soon  returned 
with  one  borne  by  strong  monkeys  to  whom  the  work  was 
familiar. 

It  was  indeed  magnificent,  well-cushioned  and  resembling  a 
chariot,  the  sides  being  marvellously  decorated  and  enriched 
with  carved  wooden  figures.  Resting  on  wonderful  supports, 
it  was  gorgeously  fitted  like  a  palace  belonging  to  the  Siddhas 
and  was  furnished  with  windows  and  balconies  that  were 
spacious  and  embellished  with  carvings,  a  work  of  extreme 
artistry.  Large  and  well  constructed  of  wood  from  the 
mountain-side,  priceless  ornaments,  strings  of  pearls  and 
splendid  crowns  gave  it  a  dazzling  appearance  and  it  was 
covered  with  clay,  painted  red  and  sprinkled  with  sandal-paste. 
Festooned  with  wreaths  of  lotuses,  shining  like  the  dawn,  it 
was  strewn  with  innumerable  flowers. 
229 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Beholding  it,  Rama  said  to  Lakshmana : — "  Let  Bali's  body 
be  placed  upon  it  with  all  speed  and  let  the  funeral  ceremony 
proceed."  Then  Sugriva,  weeping,  assisted  by  Angada, 
raised  Bali's  body  and  placed  it  on  the  litter.  Having  laid 
the  corpse  on  its  couch,  he  covered  it  with  ornaments  of  every 
kind  together  with  wreaths  and  cloths.  Thereafter,  Sugriva, 
the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  commanded  that  the  last  rites  of 
his  noble  brother  should  be  carried  out  on  the  banks  of  a  river. 

The  great  monkey  leaders  preceded  the  litter,  scattering 
jewels  of  every  kind  in  profusion.  Every  honour  due  to  a 
king  of  this  world  was  offered  by  the  Vanaras  to  their  lord  that 
day. 

Then  the  funeral  rites  began  immediately,  Angada, 
Tara  and  the  others  surrounding  the  master  they  had  lost. 
On  their  side,  the  women  who  had  lived  subject  to  his  authority 
gathered  together  crying  :  "  O  Hero,  O  Hero  ",  thus  bewailing 
the  death  of  their  lord. 

All  the  wives  of  Bali,  who  had  been  widowed,  with  Tara 
at  their  head,  accompanied  their  deceased  sovereign,  lamenting 
pitifully.  Their  cries  were  heard  in  the  depth  of  the  forest 
and  re-echoed  through  the  woods  and  among  the  rocks  on 
every  side.  Then  on  a  deserted  sandbank  surrounded  by 
water,  formed  by  a  torrent  issuing  from  the  mountain,  innumer- 
able monkeys,  inhabitants  of  the  forest,  constructed  a  pyre, 
and  those  excellent  bearers  reverently  lowered  the  litter  from 
their  shoulders  and  all  stood  round,  plunged  in  mourning. 

Seeing  her  lord  lying  on  the  funeral  bed,  Tara,  taking  his 
head  in  her  lap,  a  prey  to  extreme  grief,  began  to  lament : — 

"  O  Illustrious  and  Mighty  Prince,  O  My  Dear  One,  look 
on  me  !  Why  dost  thou  not  cast  a  single  glance  on  all  those 
who  are  plunged  in  sorrow  ?  Thou  smilest  even  in  death, 
O  Noble  Hero,  and  thy  countenance  resembles  the  rays  of 
the  rising  sun !  Death,  in  the  guise  of  Rama,  has  struck  thee 
down,  O  Monkey !  A  single  arrow  discharged  by  him  on  the 
field  of  battle  has  made  us  all  widows.  Thy  wives,  present 
here,  who  no  longer  know  how  to  leap,  O  Indra  among  Kings, 
have  come  this  painful  road  step  by  step  on  foot,  is  it  not 
known  to  thee  ?  Dost  thou  no  longer  love  these  women  whose 
radiant  looks  resemble  the  moon  ?   Why  dost  thou  not  look 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

on  Sugriva,  O  King  of  the  Monkeys  ?  Here  are  thy  counsellors, 
O  Sovereign,  also  Tara  and  the  others  and  the  leading  citizens 
surrounding  thee,  all  plunged  in  grief.  Dismiss  thy  ministers 
as  thou  wert  wont  to  do,  O  Vanquisher  of  thy  Foes,  and  we 
will  go  to  the  woods  with  thee  in  happy  dalliance." 

Then  the  women,  themselves  overwhelmed  with  affliction, 
caused  Tara  to  rise. 

Assisted  by  Sugriva,  Angada,  sobbing,  bore  his  sire  to  the 
funeral  pyre,  his  mind  distraught  with  grief,  and,  igniting  the 
flames  according  to  the  traditional  rites,  keeping  his  father  on 
his  right  hand,  he  circumambulated  him,  sorrowfully  watching 
him  setting  forth  on  his  last  journey. 

Having  performed  the  ritual  acts  in  honour  of  Bali,  that 
Bull  among  Monkeys,  accompanied  by  Sugriva  and  Tara, 
performed  his  ablutions. 

Associating  himself  with  Sugriva's  loss,  the  mighty  Kakutstha, 
sharing  his  grief,  officiated  at  the  funeral  rites. 

The  body  of  Bali,  chief  of  heroes,  full  of  glory,  whom  that 
descendant  of  Ikshwaku  had  slain  with  his  marvellous  arrow, 
having  been  cremated,  Sugriva,  whose  splendour  resembled 
a  clear  flame,  approached  Rama  and  Lakshmana  who  accom- 
panied him. 


CHAPTER    26 

Sugriva  is  installed  as  King 

The  chief  ministers  encircled  Sugriva,  who  was  clad  in  dripping 
garments  and  overcome  with  grief.  Approaching  the  illus- 
trious Rama  of  imperishable  exploits,  he  stood  before  him  with 
joined  palms  like  the  Sages  before  the  Grand-sire  of  the  World. 

Then  Hanuman,  the  son  of  Maruta,  who  resembled  a  moun- 
tain of  gold,  his  face  shining  like  the  rising  sun,  addressed  him 
with  profound  reverence  in  the  following  words  : — 

"  May  it  please  thee,  O  Kakutstha,  to  reinstate  Sugriva  in 
the  vast  and  impregnable  kingdom  of  his  mighty  ancestors. 
231 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Be  gracious  unto  him,  0  Lord,  and  permit  him  to  return  to 
his  magnificent  capital.  May  he  regulate  his  affairs  with  the 
co-operation  of  his  many  friends. 

"  After  the  purificatory  bath  of  perfumes  and  aromatic 
herbs  of  every  kind,  he  will  pay  thee  homage  and  bestow  gifts 
and  garlands  and  precious  gems,  scents  and  herbs  on  thee. 
Thou  shouldst  enter  this  marvellous  cave,  carved  out  of  the 
mountain,  and  unite  these  monkeys  with  a  master,  thus  making 
them  happy ! " 

Hearing  Hanuman's  words,  Rama,  that  Destroyer  of  Hostile 
Warriors,  answered  him  with  wisdom  and  eloquence,  saying : — 

"  Most  beloved  Hanuman,  in  accordance  with  the  behests 
of  my  sire  I  may  not  enter  a  village  or  city  for  fourteen  years. 
Let  Sugriva,  that  Bull  among  Monkeys  enter  that  prosperous 
and  glorious  city  and  be  installed  as  king  according  to  the 
traditional  rites !  " 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Hanuman,  Rama  said  to  Sugriva : — 
"  Thou  who  art  conversant  with  thy  duty,  proclaim  that  noble 
and  valiant  hero,  Angada,  heir-apparent  to  the  kingdom. 
He  is  the  eldest  son  of  thy  elder  brother  and  equal  to  him  in 
courage ;  Angada  has  a  valiant  heart  and  deserves  to  be  thine 
heir.  It  is  now  Shravana,  the  first  month  of  the  rainy  season,1 
that  brings  the  floods ;  it  is  no  time  for  military  exploits  therefore 
return  to  thy  capital.  As  for  me,  I  shall  live  on  the  mountain 
with  Lakshmana.  This  cavern,  carved  out  of  the  rock,  is 
large  and  airy  and  possesses  a  lake  whose  crystalline  waters 
abound  in  lotuses  of  every  kind.  When  the  month  of  Kartika* 
has  come,  make  ready  to  slay  Ravana,  this  is  our  pact ;  meantime, 
O  Friend,  return  to  thine  home  and  receive  the  royal  anointing, 
thus  gratifying  thy  friends." 

Thus  dismissed  by  Rama,  Sugriva,  that  Bull  among  Monkeys 
penetrated  into  the  enchanting  city  of  Kishkindha  of  which 
Bali  had  been  the  supreme  lord. 

Following  their  sovereign,  thousands  of  monkeys  prostrated 
themselves,  touching  the  dust  with  their  foreheads,  and  Sugriva, 
full  of  valour,  called  on  them  to  rise,  addressing  his  subjects 
with  affection.

That  mighty  warrior  thereafter  entered  his  brother's  private 
apartments  and,  having  come  there,  the  powerful  hero,  Sugriva, 
that  Bull  of  Forest-dwellers,  was  proclaimed  king  by  his  friends, 
as  was  formerly  the  God  of  a  Thousand  Eyes. 

Then  they  brought  him  a  white  canopy,  decorated  with  gold, 
and  two  magnificent  whisks  of  yak's  tails  with  gleaming  golden 
handles,  also  gems  of  every  kind  and  grain  and  grass,  together 
with  blossoming  branches,  flowers  and  rich  stuffs,  white 
unguents,  fragrant  garlands,  wild  flowers  and  those  that  grow 
in  water,  sacred  sandalwood,  varied  and  numerous  perfumes, 
roasted  grain,  gold,  panic  seed,  honey,  butter,  curds,  a  tiger 
skin  and  wonderfully  wrought  sandals. 

Thereafter  six  lovely  young  girls,  bringing  scents,  tallow  and 
red  and  yellow  pigments,1  entered  joyfully  and  distributed 
gems,  raiment  and  food  among  the  foremost  of  the  twice-born. 

Those  versed  in  the  sacred  formulas  then  prepared  heaps  of 
kusha  grass  and,  igniting  a  fire,  poured  out  the  Soma,  purified 
by  the  recitation  of  traditional  prayers.  Then  Sugriva, 
seated  on  a  gorgeous  golden-based  throne,  covered  with  rich 
draperies  and  a  magnificent  three-tiered  baldaquin,  decorated 
with  marvellous  garlands,  facing  the  East,  was  enthroned. 

Those  Lions  among  the  Forest-dwellers  had  visited  the  banks 
of  rivers  and  streams,  far  and  wide,  as  well  as  the  sacred  places 
and  the  seas,  in  order  to  draw  pure  water  which  they  brought 
back  in  pitchers  of  gold. 

Employing  golden  vases  and  the  polished  horns  of  bulls,  Gaja, 
Gavaksha,  Gavaya,  Sharabha,  Gandhamadana,  Mainda,  Dvivida, 
Hanuman  and  Jambavan  in  accordance  with  the  tradition  laid 
down  in  the  scriptures  and  on  the  instructions  of  the  Sages, 
poured  the  clear  and  fragrant  water  over  Sugriva,  as  formerly 
the  Vasus  bathed  Vasava  of  a  Thousand  Eyes. 

When  the  enthronement  was  completed,  all  those  illustrious 
leaders  of  the  monkeys  raised  a  shout  of  joy  again  and  again. 
Thereafter,  in  order  to  follow  Rama's  counsel,  Sugriva,  the 
King  of  the  Monkeys,  embracing  Angada,  installed  him  as  heir- 
apparent. 

Angada  received  the  investiture,  and  those  magnanimous 
Plavagas    acclaimed   him   crying   "Excellent!     Excellent!", 

1  Pigments.  Yellow  Gorocala  used  for  Tilak ;  red  Manahshila,  a 
form  of  red  arsenic.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

praising  Sugriva  and  the  great-souled  Rama  and  Lakshmana, 
All  were  overjoyed  on  this  auspicious  occasion ;  a  large  and 
merry  crowd,  fully  satisfied,  filled  the  streets,  carrying  banners 
and  standards  in  the  enchanting  city  of  Kishkindha,  which 
had  been  hollowed  out  of  the  mountain. 

Having  informed  the  illustrious  Rama  of  the  great  coronation 
ceremony  and  being  reunited  with  his  consort,  Ruma,  the 
heroic  leader  of  the  monkey  army  took  possession  of  his  kingdom, 
like  the  Chief  of  the  Immortals. 


chapter   27 

Rama  describes  Prasravana 

The  monkey  Sugriva,  having  been  crowned  king,  returned  to 
Kishkindha,  whilst  Rama  retired  to  the  Mountain  Prasravana. 

That  mountain  resounded  with  the  cries  of  tigers  and  deer, 
and  the  roaring  of  the  lions  that  frequented  it  was  heard  day 
and  night;  bushes,  diverse  creepers  and  innumerable  trees 
were  to  be  seen  everywhere.  It  was  inhabited  by  bears,  lynxes 
and  many  kinds  of  monkeys  and  resembled  a  mass  of  clouds 
sparkling  with  light  and  beauty.  On  the  summit  was  a  large  and 
spacious  cave,  which  Rama,  who  was  accompanied  by  Saumitri, 
chose  as  a  dwelling  for  himself. 

Having  contracted  an  alliance  with  Sugriva,  Rama,  the 
irreproachable  descendant  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  addressed 
his  brother  Lakshmana,  the  increaser  of  his  delight,  in  appro- 
priate and  significant  words,  saying : — 

"  O  Saumitri,  Destroyer  of  Thy  Foes !  We  should  establish 
ourselves  in  this  agreeable  rocky  cavern  during  the  rainy 
season.  This  peak,  the  most  lofty  on  this  mountain,  is  en- 
chanting, O  Prince !  White,  black  and  dun-coloured  crags 
adorn  it  and  metals  of  every  kind  abound,  while  its  rivers 
swarm  with  frogs ;  it  is  filled  with  innumerable  trees  and  charm- 
ing creepers,  where  a  variety  of  birds  warble  and  splendid 
peacocks  can  be  heard ;  Malati,  Kunda,  Sinduvara,  Shirishaka, 
Kadamba,  Arjuna  and  Sarja  trees  embellish  it  with  their  blossom. 

"  Here  is  a  lovely  pool,  festooned  with  flowering  lotus, 
adjoining  the  cave,  O  Prince.  Where  the  rock  is  hollowed  out, 
334 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

it  inclines  to  the  north  east,  which  will  make  our  stay  more 
agreeable,  whilst  on  the  west  it  is  higher  and  we  shall  be  sheltered 
from  the  winds.  At  the  entrance,  O  Saumitri,  is  a  smooth 
black  stone  like  a  piece  of  antimony  washed  in  oil ;  to  the 
north,  O  Friend,  die  crest  of  the  mountain  is  magnificent 
and  looks  like  a  mass  of  polished  collyrium  or  a  stationary  cloud. 
To  the  south,  it  stretches  like  a  white  veil,  resembling  Mount 
Kailasha,  rich  in  metals,  which  give  it  a  dazzling  appearance. 

"  Observe  this  river  of  translucent  water  like  unto  Jahnavi 
on  the  Mount  Trikuta !  Candana,  Tilaka,  Sala,  Tamala, 
Atimuktaka,  Padmaka,  Sarala  and  Ashoka  trees  embellish  it; 
Vanira,  Timida,  Bakula,  Ketaka,  Hintala,  Tinisha,  Nipa, 
Vetasa  and  Kritamalaka  trees  grow  on  its  banks,  adorning  it 
on  every  side,  like  a  woman  attired  in  rich  raiment  and  precious 
gems. 

"  Innumerable  flocks  of  birds  till  it  with  their  various  notes 
and  waterfowl  enliven  it  with  their  amorous  frolics.  The 
river  has  created  enchanting  islands  which  are  frequented  by 
swans  and  cranes ;  its  smiling  aspect  calls  to  mind  a  beautiful 
woman  wearing  innumerable  ornaments.  Here  it  is  carpeted 
with  blue  lotuses,  there  shining  with  the  red  and  in  the  distance 
white  water-lilies  may  be  seen.  Ducks  sport  here  in  their 
hundreds,  whilst  peacocks  and  curlews  fill  this  river,  full  of 
charm  and  colour,  with  their  cries,  and  groups  of  sages 
frequent  it. 

"  See  how  the  Sandal  and  Kadubha  trees  grow  in  clusters 
of  five,  as  if  planned  by  an  intelligent  will.  Ah!  What  an 
enchanting  spot !  O  Saumitri,  Thou  Scourger  of  Thy  Foes, 
let  us  enjoy  it  to  the  full  and  make  our  retreat  a  happy  one. 
Kishkindha  too  is  not  far  from  here,  that  marvellous  city  of 
Sugriva's,  where  songs  and  the  sound  of  musical  instruments 
are  heard,  O  Most  Illustrious  of  Conquerors  !  It  is  the  monkey 
warriors  sporting  to  the  sound  of  drums. 

"  Having  recovered  his  consort  and  his  kingdom,  that 
monarch  of  the  monkeys,  Sugriva,  surrounded  by  his  com- 
panions, is  assuredly  celebrating  his  return  to  full  prosperity." 

With  these  words,  Rama  with  Lakshmana  took  up  their  abode 
on  the  Mountain  Prasravana,  where  there  were  innumerable 
caves  and  woods. 

235 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIK1 

Yet  despite  the  beauty  and  abundance  of  fruits,  Rama  was 
unable  to  find  the  least  pleasure  there.  Remembering  the 
woman  who  had  been  torn  from  him  and  who  was  as  dear  to 
him  as  his  very  life's  breath,  the  more  now,  when  the  moon  was 
rising  over  the  summit  of  the  mountain,  he  was  unable  to  sleep, 
passing  the  nights  on  the  couch,  sighing,  his  spirit  troubled, 
a  prey  to  constant  grief. 

Seeing  Rama  desolate  and  a  victim  to  profound  melancholy, 
Lakshmana,  who  was  equally  afflicted,  addressed  him  in 
affectionate  words,  saying : — "  Cease  to  mourn,  O  Hero,  thou 
shouldst  not  distress  thyself  thus.  One  who  grieves  is  never 
successful,  thou  knowest  it  well.  In  this  world,  one  should 
have  faith  and  trust  in  God,  pursue  virtue  and  engage  in  action, 
O  Raghava  !  If  thy  mind  is  agitated,  thou  wilt  never  be  able 
to  overcome  that  titan,  thine  adversary,  in  combat,  for  he  is 
a  crafty  fighter. 

"  Banish  thy  grief  and  persist  in  thine  endeavour ;  it  will 
be  thine  to  triumph  over  this  demon  and  his  entire  family. 
O  Rama,  thou  canst  overthrow  the  earth  with  its  oceans, 
forests  and  mountains,  how  much  more  Ravana !  Wait  but 
till  the  autumn,  for  it  is  now  the  rainy  season,  then  thou  shalt 
destroy  him,  his  kingdom  and  his  kinsfolk.  Truly  I  desire  to 
rekindle  thy  dormant  valour,  as  at  the  hour  of  sacrifice  the 
fire  buried  beneath  the  ashes  is  revived  by  glowing  libations." 

This  salutary  and  opportune  counsel  of  Lakshmana's  was 
received  by  Rama  with  respect  and  he  answered  in  tender 
and  friendly  accents,  saying : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  inspired  by  devotion,  thou  hast  spoken  to 
me  with  wisdom  and  courage.  Henceforth  I  shall  manifest 
that  valour  no  danger  is  able  to  subdue.  I  shall  wait 
for  the  autumn  and  in  accord  with  thy  counsel  depend  on 
Sugriva's  willing  co-operation  and  the  state  of  the  rivers.  He 
who  has  rendered  a  service  merits  repayment ;  the  ungrateful 
who  do  not  honour  an  obligation  lose  the  respect  of  the  good." 
With  joined  palms,  Lakshmana  listened  with  approval  to  this 
judicious  speech  and  addressed  Rama,  who  had  regained  his 
cheerful  mien,  saying :  "  Thou  speakest  truly,  O  Chief  of 
Men;  without  fail,  that  monkey  will  bring  about  that  which 
thou  desirest.  Meantime,  while  awaiting  the  autumn,  endure 
236 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

the  rains,  resolving  to  slay  thine  adversary.  Restraining  thine 
anger,  let  us  pass  these  four  months  of  autumn  together, 
dwelling  on  the  mountain  frequented  by  lions,  and  then 
hold  thyself  in  readiness  to  destroy  thine  enemy.*' 


CHAPTER     28 

Rama  describes  the  Rainy  Season 

Having  slain  Bali  and  enthroned  Sugriva,  Rama,  who  was 
dwelling  on  the  Malyavat  plateau,  said  to  Lakshmana : — 

"  Now  the  rainy  season  is  here,  see  how  the  heavens  are 
laden  with  clouds  as  large  as  hills.  After  nine  months,  the 
sky,  by  the  action  of  the  sun's  rays,  has  sucked  up  the  waters 
of  the  ocean  and  is  now  giving  birth  to  the  showers. 

"  Ascending  to  heaven  by  the  stairway  of  the  clouds,  one 
might  decorate  the  sun  with  garlands  of  Kutaja  and  Arjuna 
blossom.  The  sky  appears  like  one  wounded,  bound  with 
the  rags  of  moisture-laden  clouds,  stained  with  the  vivid  tints 
of  the  setting  sun,  bordered  with  red.  With  the  gentle  breeze 
as  its  breath,  the  saffron  colour  lent  by  the  twilight  and  its 
yellow  clouds,  the  sky  seems  like  one  who  is  sick  with  love. 
Tormented  by  the  sun's  rays,  the  earth  is  shedding  tears, 
like  Sita  racked  by  grief.  Emerging  from  the  heart  of  the 
clouds,  cool  as  camphor,  redolent  with  the  fragrance  of  Ketaka 
flowers,  the  balmy  winds  can,  as  it  were,  be  sipped  from  the 
palms  of  the  hands. 

"  This  mountain  of  blossoming  Arjuna  trees,  planted  with 
Ketakas  and  anointed  by  showers  of  rain,  resembles  Sugriva 
freed  from  his  foes.  These  mountains,  that  the  dark  clouds 
clothe  as  with  antelope  skins,  catch  the  rain  drops  as  the  sacri- 
ficial thread,  their  caverns  filled  with  the  wind  lending  them  a 
voice;  they  resemble  studious  brahmin  disciples  reciting  the 
holy  Veda. 

"  Whipped  by  lightning  like  unto  golden  thongs,  the  sky 
seems  to  be  crying  out  in  pain.  The  flash  that  convulses  the 
breast  of  that  sombre  cloud  is  to  me  like  Sita  struggling  in 
the  arms  of  Ravana.    When  covered  by  dense  cloud,  the 

237 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

quarters  of  the  sky,  so  dear  to  lovers,  are  blotted  out,  together 
with  the  moon  and  the  stars. 

"  On  the  ridges  of  the  mountain,  as  if  drowned  in  tears, 
these  Kutaja  trees  in  full  flower,  that  sighed  for  the  rain,  rekindle 
love  in  me  in  the  midst  of  the  grief  that  overwhelms  me. 

"  The  dust  has  settled  and  a  cold  wind  blows ;  the  heat  of 
the  summer  is  allayed ;  the  martial  undertaking  of  kings  is 
suspended,  and  travellers  have  returned  to  their  own  country. 

"  Now  the  waterfowl,  in  their  haste  to  regain  the  Manasa 
lake,  have  left  with  their  dear  companions.  Chariots  and  other 
conveyances  no  longer  venture  on  the  roads,  deeply  rutted 
by  continuous  rain. 

"  Sometimes  visible,  sometimes  invisible,  the  sky,  sown 
with  clouds,  looks  like  a  ocean  encircled  with  hills.  The 
streams  carrying  away  the  Sarja  and  Kadamba  blossom  assume 
a  yellow  hue  from  the  metallic  deposits  of  the  rocks  and  pass 
swiftly  on  amidst  the  cry  of  peacocks. 

"  The  Jambu  fruit,  full  of  savour  and  gilded  like  a  bee,  is 
pleasant  to  the  taste,  and  ripe  mangoes  of  many  tints  fall  to 
the  ground  shaken  by  the  wind.  Clouds  like  high  mountains, 
having  the  lightning  as  their  banner  and  cranes  for  their 
garlands,  give  forth  a  reverberating  sound,  like  great  elephants 
intoxicated  with  Mada  juice  who  are  about  to  fight. 

"  The  grassy  slopes  of  those  forest  tracts,  revived  by  the 
rain  where  delighted  peacocks  dance,  gleam  brightly  under 
the  moon  at  night.  Charged  with  an  immense  weight  of  water, 
clouds  surrounded  by  cranes  emit  a  muttering  sound  and  in 
constant  movement  journey  on  and  on,  sometimes  resting  on 
the  mountain  tops.  In  their  joyous  circling  flight,  cranes, 
in  love  with  the  clouds,  resemble  an  enchanting  garland  of 
lotus  flowers  suspended  in  space  at  the  mercy  of  the  breeze. 

"  The  earth  with  its  fresh  grass  strewn  with  tiny  ladybirds, 
looks  like  a  woman,  whose  limbs  are  swathed  in  a  bright  green 
cloth  flecked  with  red. 

"  Sleep  falls  gently  on  Keshava;1  the  river  runs  swiftly  to  rejoin 
the  sea ;  the  crane  is  happy  to  be  united  with  the  cloud ; 
fair  ones  approach  their  lovers  with  joy. 

1  Tradition  holds  that  the  Lord  Narayana  fell  into  the  cosmic  sleep  in 
the  rainy  season,  prior  to  the  rebirth  of  Brahma,  who  issued  from  his  navel. 

238 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

"  See  how  the  groves  are  rendered  gay  by  the  dance  of 
peacocks  and  how  the  Kadamba  trees  are  covered  with  flowers ; 
bulls,  filled  with  desire,  follow  the  cows  and  the  earth  is  rendered 
charming  by  forests  and  fields  of  grain. 

"  Rivers  rush  onwards,  clouds  discharge  their  rain,  frenzied 
elephants  are  trumpeting,  the  woods  grow  more  fair,  lovers 
yearn  for  their  loved  ones,  peacocks  dance  and  the  monkeys 
have  regained  their  zest  for  life.  Drunk  with  the  aroma  of 
the  blossoming  Ketaka  trees,  amongst  the  thundering  water- 
falls, the  great  elephants  mix  their  amorous  trumpeting  with 
the  peacocks'  cries. 

"  Flowers,  bruised  by  the  downpour,  are  expelling  their 
nectar,  that  the  bees  gaily  plundered  from  the  branches  of  the 
Kadamba,  trees  and  now  it  is  falling  drop  by  drop.  With  their 
abundant  fruit  resembling  ashes,  full  of  savour,  the  boughs  of 
the  Jambu  tree  are  swarming  with  bees. 

"  Following  the  woodland  track  amidst  the  hills,  the  chief 
of  the  elephants,  hearing  the  roar  of  thunder  behind  him, 
halts  in  his  tracks,  thirsting  to  fight  and,  deeming  it  to  be  a 
challenge,  turns  back  in  fury. 

'*  Filled  now  with  the  humming  bees,  now  with  blue-necked 
peacocks  that  dance  or  great  elephants  in  rut,  the  woods 
take  on  a  thousand  varying  aspects. 

"  Abounding  in  Kadamba,  Sarja,  Arjuna  and  Kandala  trees, 
the  forest  with  the  ground  saturated  with  water,  resembling 
wine  and  the  intoxicated  peacocks  that  cry  and  dance,  takes  on 
the  appearance  of  a  banqueting  hall.  The  raindrops,  like 
pearls,  falling  in  the  folds  of  the  leaves,  rest  there  happily, 
and  the  many  coloured  birds  drink  of  them,  delighted  by  this 
gift  from  the  King  of  the  Gods. 

"  The  soft  humming  of  the  bees,  the  joyous  croaking  of  the 
frogs  blended  with  the  rumbling  thunder  of  the  clouds,  resemb- 
ling the  roll  of  drums,  create  a  veritable  orchestra  in  the  forest. 

"  The  peacocks  with  their  richly  decorated  tails  are  the 
choir,  some  dancing,  some  calling,  here  and  there  clinging 
to  the  tops  of  the  trees. 

"  Roused  by  the  sound  of  thunder,  frogs  of  different  shapes 
and  colour  waken  from  hibernation  and  whipped  by  the  rain, 
croak  loudly. 

»39 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  The  rivers,  frequented  by  waterfowl,  bear  away  their 
crumbling  banks  proud  of  their  speed,  and  happy  in  their 
fullness,  rush  towards  their  lord,  the  ocean. 

"  Sombre  clouds  charged  with  fresh  rain  melt  into  each  other 
and  resemble  the  rocks  scorched  by  the  forest  fire  whose  bases 
cohere  with  those  that  are  equally  laid  bare. 

"  Elephants  wander  in  the  midst  of  the  charming  groves, 
that  are  filled  with  the  cries  of  intoxicated  peacocks  in  the 
grass  sprinkled  with  ladybirds  and  planted  with  Nipa  and 
Arjuna  trees.  Ardently  embracing  the  lotuses,  whose  stamens 
are  flattened  by  the  recent  showers,  the  bumble  bees  eagerly 
drink  the  nectar  from  these  and  from  the  Kadamba  blossom 
that  has  been  laid  waste.  Bull  elephants  in  rut  and  leaders  of 
kine  disport  themselves  in  the  forest ;  the  king  of  beasts  bounds 
through  the  thickets  and  the  kings  of  men  are  enraptured  and 
forget  their  cares  and  anxieties  whilst  the  Chief  of  the  Gods 
is  disporting  himself  in  the  clouds.  Torrents  of  rain  loosed 
from  the  sky,  causing  the  seas  and  rivers  to  overflow,  flood 
the  streams,  lakes  and  ponds  together  with  the  entire  earth. 
With  sheets  of  rain  falling  and  the  wind  blowing  with  extreme 
violence,  the  banks  of  the  rivers  are  swept  away  and  the  waters 
surge  onwards  so  that  the  familiar  paths  can  no  longer  be  trodden. 

"  Like  kings  bathed  by  their  servants,  great  mountains  stand 
under  the  downpour  from  the  clouds,  which  resemble  ewers 
emptied  by  the  King  of  the  Celestials  assisted  by  the  Wind 
God,  and  seen  thus,  stand  forth  in  all  their  native  splendour. 

"  The  sky,  overcast  with  cloud,  renders  the  stars  invisible ; 
the  earth  is  saturated  with  the  recent  rains  and  the  four  quarters 
are  shrouded  in  darkness.  The  summits  of  the  mountains 
washed  by  the  rain  sparkle,  their  great  cataracts  twisting  and 
falling  like  strings  of  pearls.  Obstructed  in  their  course  by 
the  jutting  rocks,  these  mighty  waterfalls  precipitate  themselves 
from  the  heights  into  the  valleys  like  necklaces  of  pearls  that 
break  and  scatter.  Those  rushing  torrents,  bathing  the  lower 
reaches  of  the  rocky  crests,  fall  into  immense  chasms,  where 
they  find  themselves  imprisoned  and  spray,  resembling  strings 
of  pearls,  which  celestial  nymphs  have  broken  in  the  violence 
of  their  emotions,  are  scattered  in  unparalleled  showers  on 
every  side. 

240 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

"  Only  when  the  birds  withdraw  to  the  trees  and  the  lotus 
closes,  whilst  the  evening  jasmine  opens,  can  one  divine  that 
the  sun  has  set  behind  the  Astachala  Mountain.  Kings  postpone 
their  warlike  expeditions  and  even  the  army,  already  on  the 
march,  halts ;  hostilities  cease,  for  the  roads  are  water-logged. 
It  is  the  month  of  Prausthapada,1  when  the  brahmins  who 
chant  the  Veda,  the  singers  of  the  Sama  Veda,  begin  their 
studies. 

"  Assuredly  Bharata,  the  King  of  Koshala,  having  collected 
the  revenue  and  completed  the  storing  of  provisions,  is  now 
engaged  in  celebrating  the  festival  of  the  month  of  Ashada.2 

"  The  Sarayu  river  must  be  overflowing  its  banks  and  the 
current  increasing  in  velocity,  like  the  shouts  of  acclamation 
with  which  Ayodhya  will  greet  my  return. 

"  Sugriva  will  be  listening  with  joy  to  the  sheets  of  rain 
falling,  since  he  has  overcome  his  adversary,  recovered  his 
consort  and  regained  his  vast  kingdom;  but  I,  O  Lakshmana, 
separated  from  Sita,  exiled  from  my  immense  dominion, 
resemble  the  bank  of  a  river  that  has  been  carried  away  by  the 
current  and  precipitated  into  an  abyss. 

"  My  grief  is  without  bourne,  the  rains  close  every  avenue 
and  Ravana  appears  to  me  a  formidable  and  invincible  foe. 
Unable  to  travel  on  these  impassable  roads,  I  wish  to  make  no 
demands  on  Sugriva  despite  his  devotion,  who  after  prolonged 
suffering  is  reunited  with  his  spouse ;  I  do  not  desire  to  press 
for  an  interview  on  account  of  the  urgency  of  his  private  concerns. 

"  As  for  that,  when  he  has  rested  and  the  time  is  ripe, 
Sugriva  will  of  himself  remember  the  help  he  has  promised  me, 
there  is  no  doubt  of  it.  Because  of  this,  I  wait  hopefully,  till 
the  rivers  and  Sugriva  are  favourable  to  me,  O  Thou  who 
bearest  the  auspicious  marks  of  royalty ! 

"  A  favour  obliges  a  man  to  show  gratitude ;  the  ungrateful 
who  fail  to  honour  an  obligation  wound  the  heart  of  honest 
men." 

Lakshmana,  standing  with  joined  palms,  fully  concurred 
with  these  words  to  which  he  listened  with  extreme  respect;

then  addressing  the  magnanimous  Rama  with  a  joyful  air, 
he  said : — 

"  O  Prince,  the  Ring  of  the  Monkeys  will  not  delay  in 
carrying  out  the  desire  thou  hast  expressed !  Wait  for  the 
autumn  and  let  the  rainy  season  pass,  re-affirming  thy  resolution 
to  overcome  thine  adversary." 


chapter   29 

Hanuman  urges  Sugriva  to  honour  his  Promise 

Hanuman  observed  that  the  heavens  had  become  serene,  tree 
from  lightning  or  cloud,  filled  with  the  cry  of  cranes  and 
marvellously  illumined  by  the  light  of  the  moon. 

Sugriva  however,  having  attained  his  end,  had  become 
indifferent  to  his  duty  and  proper  responsibilities,  allowing  his 
mind  to  engage  in  lower  pursuits.  His  ambitions  fulfilled,  he 
ceased  to  harbour  any  solicitude  concerning  his  affairs  and  gave 
himself  up  to  enjoyment  with  women,  satisfying  every  capricious 
desire. 

Having  realised  his  hopes  and  his  fears  being  allayed,  he 
passed  the  time  by  day  and  by  night  with  his  favourite  consort 
Ruma  and  also  Tara  who  was  equally  dear  to  him,  as  the  Lord 
of  the  Gods  disports  himself  among  the  troops  of  nymphs  and 
musicians.  Leaving  the  administration  of  the  state  to  his 
ministers  without  supervision,  his  realm  not  being  in  peril,  he 
became  a  slave  to  sense  pleasures. 

Seeing  this,  the  resourceful  Hanuman,  the  eloquent  son  of 
Maruta,  conversant  with  what  ought  to  be  done  and  knowing 
the  appropriate  time  for  the  performance  of  duty,  approaching 
the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  who  well  understood  what  was 
placed  before  him,  spoke  to  him  with  confidence,  in  well 
chosen  words  inspired  by  respect  and  affection,  words  that 
were  pleasing,  full  of  good  sense,  practical,  true,  salutary,  in 
accord  with  the  law  and  duty,  expedient  and  diplomatic.  Even 
such  was  the  speech  of  Hanuman,  which  he  addressed  to  the 
King  of  the  Monkeys. 

242 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

He  said : — 

"  Thou  hast  recovered  thy  throne  and  thy  glory  and  added 
to  the  prosperity  of  thine  house ;  it  now  remains  for  thee  to 
concern  thyself  with  thy  friends  ;  this  is  thy  duty  !  He  who, 
recognizing  the  fitting  moment,  conducts  himself  honourably 
towards  his  friends,  sees  the  increase  of  his  glory  and  his  power. 

"  He  who  treats  with  equal  regard,  wealth,  sceptre,  friends 
and  life  itself,  O  Prince,  acquires  a  vast  empire.  Let  this  be 
thy  conduct,  establish  thyself  in  the  path  of  honour,  this  is 
what  thou  shouldst  do  for  thy  friends  in  accordance  with  thy  vow. 

"  He  who  does  not  abandon  everything  in  order  to  occupy 
himself  with  the  interests  of  his  friends,  whatever  his  aim, 
enthusiasm  or  undertakings,  is  courting  failure. 

"  In  the  same  way,  he  who  allows  the  occasion  for  coming 
to  the  assistance  of  his  friends  to  pass  is  worthless,  even  if  he 
achieve  great  things.  We  are  losing  this  opportunity  of  serving 
the  interests  of  our  friend  Raghava,  O  Vanquisher  of  Thy  Foes. 
Let  us  occupy  ourselves  with  finding  Vaidehi.  Rama  has  not 
reminded  thee  that  the  time  appointed  has  gone  by,  though 
he  is  fully  conversant  with  the  hour ;  albeit  hard  pressed,  that 
sagacious  prince  has  graciously  resigned  himself,  O  King  ! 

"  It  is  to  Raghava  that  thou  owest  the  prosperity  of  thine 
House,  he  wields  immense  influence,  his  power  is  immeasur- 
able, his  personal  attributes  incomparable.  Render  back  the 
service  he  has  done  to  thee,  O  Chief  of  the  Monkeys,  call 
together  the  leaders  of  thy  people  !  The  delay  is  not  yet  serious, 
as  long  as  Rama  does  not  call  upon  thee  to  redeem  thy  promise, 
but  if  thou  defer  till  he  constrain  thee  by  force,  it  will  be  too  late. 

"  Even  had  he  done  nought  for  thee,  it  would  be  thy  duty 
to  assist  him  in  his  quest,  O  Chief  of  Monkeys !  How  much 
more  so  after  the  service  he  has  rendered  thee  in  re-establishing 
thee  on  thy  throne  and  slaying  Bali. 

"  Thou  art  powerful  and  thy  courage  is  extreme,  O  Thou 
who  rulest  the  monkeys  and  the  bears,  therefore  thou  art  under 
a  greater  obligation  to  assist  Rama. 

"  Without  doubt  the  son  of  Dasaratha  is  able  to  overcome 

the  Gods,  the  demons  and  the  great  serpents  with  his  arrows, 

he  is  merely  awaiting  the  fulfilment  of  thy  vow.    It  was  not 

without  risking  his  life  that  he  bestowed  such  happiness  on 

243  R 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

thee.  Let  us  scour  the  earth  and,  if  need  be,  the  sky,  in  search 
of  Sita.  Neither  the  Devas,  Danavas,  Gandharvas  or  Asuras 
accompanied  by  the  hosts  of  Maruts,  nor  the  Yakshas  are  able 
to  make  him  tremble,  much  less  the  titans. 

"  It  is  imperative,  O  Prince  of  the  Tawny-coloured  Ones, 
that  thou  shouldst  try  to  please  Rama  with  thine  whole  soul, 
who  is  endowed  with  that  power  that  formerly  succoured  thee. 

"We  will  not  hesitate  to  enter  the  subterranean  regions 
beneath  the  waters  nor  ascend  into  the  sky  if  thou  commandest 
it,  O  King  of  the  Monkeys !  Do  thou  decree  who  shall  proceed 
and  how  and  in  what  order.  There  are  more  than  ten  million 
monkeys  of  indomitable  strength  ready  to  serve  thee,  O 
Irreproachable  Prince ! " 

Hearing  these  apposite  and  reasonable  words,  Sugriva,  in 
his  rectitude,  made  a  supreme  decision. 

Wisely  commanding  Nila  of  inexhaustible  valour  to  gather 
the  troops  from  every  quarter,  he  said : — 

"  Do  thou  muster  mine  entire  army  with  its  leaders  and 
generals,  whom  none  can  resist,  and  bring  them  here  immedi- 
ately. The  Plavagas  who  are  stationed  on  the  frontiers  are 
skilled  and  brave,  let  them  come  here,  see  to  it  personally 
that  I  am  instantly  obeyed.  He  who  does  not  present  himself 
within  fifteen  days  from  now  will  be  summarily  executed, 
none  shall  escape. 

"  With  Angada,  seek  out  the  veterans,  carry  out  my  orders 
scrupulously." 

Having  made  all  these  arrangements,  the  Chief  of  the  Monkeys, 
the  valiant  Sugriva,  returned  to  his  private  apartments. 


chapter   30 

Description  of  Autumn 

Sugriva  re-entered  his  palace,  and  the  sky  being  free  from 
cloud,  Rama,  who,  during  the  rainy  season,  had  been  overcome 
by  the  intensity  of  his  grief,  gazing  on  the  pure  and  tranquil 
moon  and  the  marvellously  clear  autumnal  nights,  perceiving 
244 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

that  Sugriva  was  leading  a  life  of  pleasure  and  reflecting  on 
his  own  loss,  also  that  time  was  passing,  fell  into  a  profound 
melancholy. 

Though  he  soon  mastered  his  mood,  yet  the  wise  Raghava 
remained  absorbed  in  the  thought  of  Sita,  and  seeing  the  sky 
free  from  cloud  taking  on  a  serene  aspect,  re-echoing  to  the 
call  of  cranes,  he  began  to  lament  in  sorrowful  accents.  Seated 
on  the  jutting  ridge  of  a  mountain  rich  in  gold,  under  the 
autumnal  sky,  his  thoughts  went  out  to  his  beloved  spouse  and 
he  reflected : — 

"  What  joy  can  my  youthful  wife  experience  now,  she,  who 
loved  the  call  of  the  cranes  in  the  forest  and  imitated  their  note  ? 
In  mine  absence,  how  can  that  tender  maid  take  any  delight  in 
the  tufts  of  flowers  shining  like  pure  gold,  she,  who  formerly 
wakened  to  the  cry  of  the  swans  ?  What  felicity  can  Sita  of 
soft  speech  and  tender  form  enjoy  now  ? 

"  When  she  hears  the  cry  of  the  wild  geese,  travelling  in 
skeins,  what  will  become  of  that  princess,  whose  eyes  are  as 
large  as  lotuses  ?  I  feel  no  happiness  without  Sita,  whose  eyes 
resembled  the  doe's,  when  wandering  by  river,  lake  and  forest, 
and  my  beloved  in  her  tenderness  will  suffer  cruelly  in  mine 
absence,  through  the  desire  that  the  beauty  of  autumn  inspires." 
Thus  did  that  son  of  a  King  lament  like  unto  the  Saranga  bird 
when  it  solicits  water  from  Indra. 

At  that  moment,  Lakshmana,  who  had  gone  out  in  careful 
search  of  fruits,  returned  from  the  enchanting  mountain  slopes 
and  perceiving  his  elder  brother  absorbed  in  sorrowful  thoughts, 
bis  mind  distraught,  alone  in  that  solitude,  the  sagacious 
Saumitri,  who  was  deeply  distressed  by  the  grief  of  bis  un- 
fortunate brother,  said  to  him : — 

"  Why,  O  Noble  Prince,  hast  thou  become  a  slave  to  love  ? 
Why  this  reversion  of  thy  former  resolution  ?  Thy  distress 
precludes  thee  from  reflecting  calmly ;  tranquiUity  of  mind  is 
essential  to  carrying  out  any  design ;  after  mature  consideration, 
the  time  ordained  together  with  the  strength  of  thine  ally 
should  be  utilised  by  thee  for  carrying  out  thy  project  without 
delay,  O  Friend! 

"  Nay !  The  daughter  of  Janaka  supported  by  thee,  will 
not  be  of  easy  access  to  the  foe,  O  Protector  of  the  Human 
245 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Race.   None  may  approach  a  blazing  fire  without  being  burnt, 
O  Valiant  Warrior !  " 

On  this,  Rama  answered  the  indomitable  Lakshmana  in 
characteristic  accents  that  were  worthy  of  him,  saying  : — 

"  Thy  words  are  practical  and  wise,  full  of  good  sense  and 
in  accord  with  duty  and  the  law.  We  should  reflect  on  how 
to  act  without  delay ;  this  quest  must  be  pursued ;  when  one 
is  powerful,  invincible,  youthful  and  valiant,  one  should  have 
no  misgivings  concerning  one's  success." 

Then  recollecting  Sita,  whose  eyes  were  as  large  as  lotus 
petals,  Rama  with  a  downcast  mien  again  addressed  Lakshmana, 
saying : — 

"  The  Thousand-eyed  God,  having  saturated  the  earth  with 
water  and  caused  the  grain  to  germinate,  his  task  accomplished, 
is  now  resting.  The  clouds,  which  amidst  a  deep  and  pro- 
longed rumbling  spread  over  the  mountains,  forests  and 
cities,  letting  loose  their  showers,  are  stationary,  O  Prince. 
The  fury  of  the  thunderclouds,  resembling  intoxicated  elephants, 
black  as  the  leaves  of  the  blue  lotus,  darkening  the  ten  regions 
has  abated.  Swollen  with  water,  the  clouds  have  visited  the 
fragrant  groves  of  Kutaja  and  Arjuna  trees  with  wind  and  rain 
and  have  now  disappeared  in  their  airy  flight,  O  My  Friend.  The 
clamour  of  the  herds  of  elephants,  the  cry  of  the  peacocks  and 
the  sound  of  the  rain  have  ceased,  O  Irreproachable  Lakshmana. 

"  Washed  by  dense  clouds  that  have  removed  their  impurities, 
the  mountains  with  their  magnificent  escarpments  shine  forth 
illumined  by  the  moon's  rays. 

H  Autumn  now  manifests  her  grace  in  the  branches  of  the 
Saptacchada  trees,  in  the  light  of  sun,  moon  and  stars  and  in 
the  gait  of  the  majestic  elephants,  and  her  influence  appears 
everywhere.  In  the  tufts  of  lotuses  opening  to  the  first  rays 
of  the  sun,  in  the  scent  of  the  Saptacchada  flowers,  in  the 
music  of  the  humming  bees,  autumn  shines  in  all  her  splendour. 

"  The  geese  with  their  large  and  graceful  wings,  friends  of 
the  God  of  Love,  have  just  arrived,  covered  with  the  pollen 
of  the  lotuses  and  are  walking  to  and  fro  on  the  sandy  banks  of 
the  rivers,  disporting  themselves  with  the  swans. 

"  In  the  intoxicated  elephants,  in  the  kine,  in  the  tranquilly 
flowing  rivers,  autumn  is  reflected  in  her  myriad  aspects. 
246 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

Seeing  the  sky  bereft  of  cloud,  the  peacocks  in  the  woods, 
shorn  of  their  caudal  beauty,  are  no  longer  attracted  to  their 
chosen  ones  and  having  lost  their  brilliance,  their  delight  has 
evaporated  and  they  appear  absorbed  in  their  own  thoughts. 

"  The  tall  trees  of  sweet  fragrance,  the  tips  of  whose  branches 
are  bent  under  the  weight  of  their  blossom,  shining  like  gold, 
enchanting  to  look  upon,  seem  to  light  up  the  depth  of  the 
forest. 

"  Accompanied  by  their  females,  the  great  elephants,  fre- 
quenters of  the  pools  covered  with  lotuses  and  the  woods, 
who  formerly  stood  amidst  the  flowers,  intoxicated  with  ichor, 
now  walk  with  a  slow  and  languid  pace,  merged  in  amorous  sport. 
"  The  sky  has  cleared  and  is  as  bright  as  a  drawn  sword ; 
the  water  in  the  river  flows  slowly  j  a  breeze,  refreshing  the 
white  water  lilies,  blows  and  those  regions  delivered  from  the 
darkness  shine  forth. 

"  Freed  from  mud  by  the  growing  warmth  of  the  sun,  the 
soil  is  covered  with  a  thick  dust  that  the  wind  carries  to  a 
great  distance. 

"  It  is  the  time  when  kings,  at  enmity  with  each  other,  start 
on  their  campaigns. 

"  Shining  with  beauty  with  which  the  autumn  has  endowed 
them,  exulting,  their  hmbs  powdered  with  dust,  mad  with 
desire  and  thirsting  to  fight,  the  bulls  bellow  amidst  the  kine. 
"  Sharing  his  love,  the  noble  she  elephant,  eager  and  affec- 
tionate, with  a  slow  tread  circles  round  the  bull  intoxicated 
with  ichor  and  follows  him  in  the  woods. 

"  Bereft  of  their  tail  feathers,  their  marvellous  natural  adorn- 
ment, wandering  on  the  banks  of  the  rivers,  the  peacocks,  as  if 
scorned  by  the  cranes,  move  about  forlornly,  in  flocks. 

"  With  their  formidable  cries,  the  chief  of  the  elephants 
strike  terror  in  the  ducks  and  geese  standing  in  the  pools 
covered  with  flowering  lotuses  and,  having  sprinkled  them- 
selves with  water  again  and  again,  begin  to  drink. 

"  On  the  rivers,  free  of  mud,  with  their  sandy  banks  and 
peaceful  ripples  frequented  by  herds  of  kine,  re-echoing  to  the 
cry  of  cranes,  herons  frolic  joyously. 

"  The  sound  of  the  rivers,  the  clouds,  the  waterfalls,  the 
winds,  the  cry  of  the  peacocks  and  the  croaking  of  frogs  has 
247 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

ceased.  Many  coloured  venomous  serpents,  greatly  emaciated, 
deprived  of  food  during  the  rains,  tormented  with  hunger 
emerge  from  their  holes  where  they  have  been  confined  so  long. 

"  The  evening,  caressed  by  the  rays  of  the  trembling  moon, 
casts  aside  her  veil,  revealing  her  roseate  countenance  with  its 
stars,  in  an  ecstasy  of  joy.  The  night,  whose  gentle  face  is 
the  full  moon,  resembles  a  youthful  woman,  the  clusters  of 
stars  her  smile  and  charming  mien  ;  lit  by  the  orb  at  its  full 
it  seems  as  if  wrapped  in  a  white  mantle. 

"  Gorged  with  ripe  grain,  an  enchanting  flock  of  cranes 
joyfully  crosses  the  sky  in  rapid  flight,  blown  by  the  breeze 
like  a  garland  of  flowers  tastefully  interwoven. 

"  The  waters  of  the  great  lake,  with  a  solitary  swan  floating 
there  asleep  amidst  countless  waterlilies,  resembles  the  heavens 
free  from  cloud,  illumined  by  the  full  moon  and  a  myriad  stars. 
With  their  girdle  of  swans,  their  wreaths  of  blue  and  white 
lotus  in  flower,  the  great  lakes  are  surpassingly  beautiful  and 
resemble  lovely  women  decorated  with  jewels. 

"  At  break  of  dawn,  blending  with  the  sound  of  the  breeze 
blowing  through  the  reeds,  resembling  the  notes  of  a  flute, 
the  deep  roarings  in  the  caverns,  increased  by  the  wind  and  the 
bellowing  of  bulls,  seem  to  answer  one  another. 

"  The  river  banks  adorned  with  flowering  grasses,  stirred 
by  a  gentle  breeze,  resemble  bright  linen  cloths  from  which  the 
stains  have  been  washed  away. 

"  Bumble  bees,  roaming  at  will  in  the  forest,  gorged  with 
nectar,  heavy  with  the  pollen  of  lotuses,  where  they  have 
rested,  in  an  excess  of  joy  accompanied  by  their  loved  ones, 
follow  the  God  of  the  Wind,  in  the  woods. 

"  The  calm  waters,  the  flowering  grasses,  the  cry  of  curlews, 
the  ripened  paddy  fields,  the  gentle  breeze,  the  immaculate 
moon,  are  all  celebrating  the  departure  of  the  rainy  season. 

"  To-day  the  rivers,  wearing  their  silver  fish  as  girdles, 
flow  by  slowly,  like  lovely  women,  moving  languidly,  having 
passed  the  night  in  love. 

"  With  the  geese,  aquatic  plants1  and  the  reeds  that  cover 
them  like  woven  shawls,  the  rivers,  sparkling,  resemble  the 
faces  of  women.

"  In  the  forest,  adorned  with  arches  of  blossom  and  full  of 
the  joyous  humming  of  bees,  the  God  of  Love,  to-day,  im- 
patiently wields  his  fiery  bow. 

"  Having  saturated  the  earth  with  their  profuse  showers 
and  filled  the  lakes  and  rivers,  preparing  the  soil  for  the  harvest, 
the  clouds  have  disappeared  from  the  sky. 

"  Little  by  little,  die  rivers  in  autumn  uncover  their  banks, 
like  chaste  brides  disclosing  their  charms. 

"  O  My  Friend,  the  waters  having  subsided,  the  rivers  re- 
echo to  the  cry  of  ospreys  and  flocks  of  geese  abound  in  the  ponds. 

"  It  is  the  time,  O  Beloved  Prince,  when  kings  declare  war 
on  each  other  and  thirsty  for  conquest  enter  upon  their  cam- 
paigns. The  inception  of  hostilities  for  monarchs  has  begun, 
O  Prince,  and  I  do  not  see  Sugriva  making  ready  for  an  expedi- 
tion of  this  kind. 

"  Asana,  Saptaparna,  Kovidara  trees  are  in  full  flower  as  also  the 
Bandhujiva  plant  and  the  Tamala  trees  on  the  mountain  slopes. 

"  O  Lakshmana !  Behold  the  sandy  banks  of  the  rivers  abound 
in  swans,  cranes,  geese  and  osprey  that  are  seen  on  every  side. 
The  four  months  of  rain  that  have  passed  seemei  to  me  like  a 
hundred  years,  so  filled  with  grief  was  I  on  account  of  Sita's  absence. 

"  Like  the  Chakravaka  bird  with  its  mate,  she  followed  me 
in  the  forest  and  the  dreadful  loneliness  of  the  Dandaka 
solitudes  seemed  to  that  youthful  woman  a  garden  of  delight. 
Though  far  from  my  beloved,  overcome  with  sorrow,  bereft  of 
my  kingdom  and  an  exile,  yet  Sugriva  shows  no  pity  for  me, 
0  Lakshmana! 

"  '  He  is  without  support,  deprived  of  his  kingdom,  affronted 
by  Ravana,  unhappy,  exiled,  that  amorous  prince  has  taken 
refuge  with  me.'  Thus  will  Sugriva  speak,  O  My  Friend, 
and  in  his  perversity,  he,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  holds  me 
in  contempt,  I,  the  Scourge  of  My  Foes.  Having  fixed  a  time 
to  set  out  in  search  of  Sita  and  entered  into  a  formal  contract 
to  do  so,  this  false  one,  having  obtained  his  ends,  has  forgotten 
his  pledge. 

"  Do  thou  enter  Kishkindha  and  in  my  name,  address  that 

Bull  of  the  Monkeys,  the  wretched  Sugriva,  the  slave  of  domestic 

bliss,  saying : — *  He  who,  having  raised  the  hopes  of  those  who

the  least  of  men  in  this  world  but  that  valiant  one,  who  for 
good  or  evil  loyally  honours  his  given  word,he  is  the  best  of  men. 

" (  Even  the  carnivorous  beasts  refuse  to  feed  on  the  flesh 
of  those  ungrateful  beings,  who,  having  obtained  their  end, 
do  not  assist  their  friends  to  do  so  in  their  turn. 

"  *  Assuredly  thou  desirest  to  behold  the  gleam  of  my  gold 
backed  bow,  resembling  a  series  of  lightning  flashes,  stretched 
ready  for  combat.  Then  shalt  thou  hear  the  dread  twanging 
of  my  bowstring  like  unto  the  clash  of  thunder,  when  in  wrath, 
I  range  the  field  of  battle.' 

"  Having  brought  my  renowned  valour  to  his  remembrance, 
O  Illustrious  Prince,  thou,  who  art  my  companion,  it  would  be 
strange  if  he  did  not  pause  and  reflect.  O  Thou  Conqueror

his  desire,  he  no  longer  recollects  the  time  chosen,  and  the 
King  of  the  Monkeys,  wholly  given  over  to  pleasure,  does  not 
appear  to  be  aware  that  four  months  have  passed.  Drinking 
and  roystering  with  his  ministers  and  his  court,  Sugriva  does 
not  trouble  himself  about  us,  who  are  filled  with  anxiety. 

"  Go  and  address  him,  O  Valiant  Hero,  inform  him  of  our 
displeasure  and  speak  to  him  in  those  terms,  which  are  in- 
spired by  my  wrath,  saying : — *  The  Gate  of  Death,  through 
which  Bali  passed,  is  not  closed !  O  Sugriva,  honour  thy 
pledge,  for  fear  that  thou  mayest  follow  in  the  path  taken 
by  him ! '  Thy  brother  died  alone,  struck  down  by  mine 
arrow  but  if  thou  failest  in  faith,  I  shall  destroy  thee  together 
with  thine  whole  House.' 

"  O  Greatest  of  Men,  say  all  that  will  further  our  desire, 
we  must  not  delay,  O  Prince.  Say  to  him '  Honour  the  promise 
thou  didst  make  to  me,  O  King  of  the  Monkeys,  recollect  that 
virtue  is  eternal  or,  losing  thy  life  this  day,  thou  shalt  fall  into 
the  jaws  of  death,  where  my  shafts  shall  despatch  thee  to 
seek  out  Bali  ! '  " 

Seeing  his  elder  brother,  who  was  afflicted  in  his  great 
misfortune,  in  the  throes  of  violent  anger,  Lakshmana,  burning 
with  courage,  the  promoter  of  the  glory  of  Manu's  Race,  pro- 
foundly distressed,  felt  a  deep  resentment  towards  the  King  of 
the  Monkeys.

KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

CHAPTER    3  I 

Lakshmana  goes  to  Kiskkindha 

The  offspring  of  that  Indra  among  Men,  the  son  of  a  king, 
then  spoke  to  his  elder  brother,  who,  full  of  tenderness,  cheer- 
less, despite  his  natural  gaiety  and  full  of  distress,  had  but 
now  expressed  his  desire  to  him  : — 

"  Nay,  that  monkey  is  not  a  civilized  being ;  he  does  not 
consider  the  immediate  consequences  of  his  acts  nor  will  he 
enjoy  the  glory  of  the  monkey  realm  ;  it  is  not  fitting  he  should 
take  advantage  of  circumstances  in  this  wise.  In  his  stupidity, 
he  has  become  the  slave  of  domestic  bliss  without  calling  to 
mind  the  debt  he  owes  to  thee ;  let  him  therefore  die  and  seek 
out  Bali ;  the  throne  should  not  be  conferred  on  one  devoid 
of  virtue.  I  am  unable  to  contain  my  violent  rage ;  I  shall 
slay  that  disloyal  Sugriva  immediately.  That  son  of  Bali 
with  the  leaders  of  the  monkeys  shall  this  day  assist  us  to 
recover  the  princess." 

Then  Rama,  the  Destroyer  of  Warriors,  in  terms  that  were 
prudent  and  appropriate,  addressed  Lakshmana,  who  bow  in 
hand  desired  to  follow  up  his  words  with  action  and  who 
full  of  ire  was  burning  to  fight :  — 

"  Nay,  thine  equals  in  this  world  do  not  commit  such  an 
outrage,1  the  warrior  who  nobly  masters  his  anger,  is  the 
greatest  of  heroes.  Do  not  belie  thy  natural  integrity,  O 
Lakshmana  !  Recollect  the  feelings  of  joy  that  the  alliance 
with  Sugriva  formerly  aroused  in  thee.  Speak  to  him  in 
moderate  tones,  omitting  all  harsh  expressions,  regarding  bis 
delay  and  his  tardiness." 

Thus  counselled  by  his  elder  brother,  that  Lion  among  Men, 
the  valiant  Lakshmana,  the  Slayer  of  Hostile  Warriors,  entered 
the  town  of  Kishkindha.  The  sage  and  virtuous  Lakshmana, 
eager  to  carry  out  what  was  agreeable  to  his  brother,  filled  with 
indignation,  entered  the  abode  of  that  monkey,  bearing  in  his 
1  That  is  slay  a  Mend. 

251 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

hand  his  bow,  resembling  India's,  high  as  the  peak  of  a  moun- 
tain, like  unto  Mt.  Mandara. 

Faithful  to  the  behest  of  Rama,  his  younger  brother,  the 
equal  of  Brihaspati,  reflected  in  himself  how  he  should  address 
and  answer  Sugriva  and,  filled  with  ire  on  account  of  his 
brother's  anguish  and  displeasure,  Lakshmana  advanced  like  a 
loosened  tempest,  uprooting  Sala,  Tala,  Ashwakarna  and  other 
trees  in  his  impetuous  strides,  like  a  great  elephant  shattering 
the  mountains  and  crushing  the  rocks  under  his  feet,  thus 
cutting  short  he  distance  to  bis  goal. 

That  Tiger  among  the  Ikshvakus  then  beheld  the  splendid 
city  of  the  King  of  Monkeys,  the  inaccessible  Kishkindha, 
hollowed  out  of  the  mountain  and  filled  with  warriors.  His 
lips  trembling  in  his  fury  against  Sugriva,  Lakshmana  beheld 
those  formidable  looking  monkeys  ranging  round  the  city  and 
seeing  that  foremost  of  men,  those  monkeys  resembling 
elephants,  tore  up  parts  of  the  mountain,  rocks,  boulders  and 
great  trees.  Lakshmana,  observing  them  seizing  hold  of  these 
missiles,  felt  his  anger  redoubled,  like  a  brazier  lit  with  innumer- 
able brands,  and  they,  beholding  that  infuriated  warrior,  who 
resembled  the  God  of  Death  himself  at  the  dissolution  of  the 
worlds,  fled  in  their  hundreds  on  all  sides. 

At  that,  those  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  returning  to  Sugriva's 
palace,  informed  him  of  Lakshmana's  approach  and  of  his 
anger,  but  that  King  of  the  Monkeys  who  was  passing  his  time 
in  dalliance  with  Tara  paid  no  heed  to  what  those  Lions  among 
Monkeys  were  saying. 

Thereupon,  under  the  orders  of  the  ministers,  those  monkeys, 
their  hair  standing  on  end,  large  as  mountains  or  elephants  or 
clouds,  issued  out  of  the  city  and  terrible  to  behold  with  their 
nails  and  teeth,  their  jaws  like  tigers,  stationed  themselves  in 
the  open.  Many  had  the  strength  of  ten  elephants,  others 
were  ten  times  as  strong  and  some  were  endowed  with  the 
strength  of  a  thousand  elephants. 

Lakshmana,  who  was  enraged,  recognized  that  Kishkindha, 
filled  with  these  monkeys,  who  were  armed  with  trunks  of  trees 
and  endowed  with  great  valour,  was  difficult  of  access.  And 
emerging  from  the  walls  and  ditches,  these  monkeys  stood 
courageously  in  the  open  field. 

252 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

In  the  face  of  Sugriva's  debauched  indifference  and  the 
provocative  attitude  of  the  monkeys,  the  valiant  Lakshmana, 
guardian  of  the  interests  of  his  elder  brother,  was  seized  with 
fresh  anger,  and  that  lion  among  men,  heaving  deep  and  burning 
sighs,  his  glances  flashing  with  fury,  resembled  a  brazier  belching 
forth  smoke. 

With  his  pointed  darts  as  the  flickering  tongue,  his  military 
ardour  the  poison,  his  bow  the  coils,  he  resembled  a  five- 
headed  snake  or  the  blazing  fire  at  the  end  of  the  world  or  the 
enraged  serpent  king. 

Then  Angada,  who  had  gone  out  to  meet  him,  in  his  terror, 
suffered  extreme  discomfiture  and  that  illustrious  warrior 
Lakshmana,  his  eyes  red  with  anger,  commanded  him  saying : — 
"  O  Child,  inform  Sugriva  of  my  advent  and  tell  him  that 
the  younger  brother  of  Rama  has  come.  O  Conqueror  of  thy 
Foes,  tormented  by  his  brother's  grief,  Lakshmana  waits  at  thy 
gate.  Do  thou  seek  to  prepare  that  monkey  by  addressing  him 
in  this  wise  and  return  with  all  speed  to  inform  me  of  his  answer, 
O  Dear  Child." 

Hearing  these  words  spoken  by  Lakshmana,  Angada,  filled 
with  distress,  went  to  seek  out  his  uncle,  who  now  occupied  his 
father's  place  and  said  to  him :  "  Saumitri  is  come !  " 

Then  Angada,  overwhelmed  by  the  harsh  accents  of  that  hero, 
his  countenance  bearing  the  traces  of  profound  distress,  went 
away,  first  offering  obeisance  to  the  feet  of  the  king  in 
great  reverence  and  thereafter  to  those  of  Ruma. 

That  valiant  prince,  having  touched  the  feet  of  his  father, 
then  made  obeisance  to  his  mother  also  and  finally  pressed 
the  feet  of  Ruma  having  informed  Sugriva  of  what  had  taken  place. 

Sugriva,  heavy  with  sleep  and  fatigue,  did  not  wake  up  but 
lay  in  a  drunken  stupor,  sexual  indulgence  having  dulled  his 
reason. 

Meantime,  seeing  Lakshmana,  fear  troubling  their  hearts, 
the  monkeys  welcomed  him  with  shouts  to  appease  his  wrath. 
Beholding  him  near  at  hand,  they  raised  a  great  clamour,  re- 
sembling a  huge  wave  or  the  growl  of  thunder  or  the  roaring 
of  lions;  and  this  great  tumult  roused  that  red-eyed  monkey 
adorned  with  garlands  who  was  bemused  with  liquor,  bis  mind 
bewildered. 

253 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Recognizing  his  voice,  two  ministers  of  that  king  of  the 
monkeys,  accompanied  by  Angada,  approached  him.  Both 
were  of  noble  and  venerable  appearance  and  were  named 
Yaksha  and  Prabhava.  Ingratiating  themselves  by  their  speech 
that  went  straight  to  the  point  and  sitting  down  near  the  king, 
who  resembled  Indra,  the  Lord  of  the  Maruts,  they  said  to 
him: — 

"  There  are  two  brothers,  full  of  nobility  and  power,  Rama 
and  Lakshmana,  who  in  human  form  are  worthy  of  the  kingdom 
they  confer  on  others.  One  of  them,  bow  in  hand,  stands 
at  the  door  ;  beholding  him,  the  monkeys,  terrified,  are  raising  a 
great  clamour.  This  brother  of  Raghava,  Lakshmana,  his 
spokesman,  charged  by  him  to  communicate  his  wishes,  has 
come  at  Rama's  command  and  the  son  of  Tara,  the  beloved 
Angada,  has  been  sent  to  thee  in  all  haste  by  Lakshmana,  O 
King,  as  his  deputy,  O  Irreproachable  Prince. 

"  That  valiant  warrior  Lakshmana  stands  at  the  door,  his 
eyes  inflamed  with  anger  and  consumes  the  monkeys  with  his 
glances,  O  King.  Go  quickly  and  place  thy  head  at  his  feet  with 
all  those  who  belong  to  thee,  O  Great  Monarch,  so  that  his 
anger  may  be  instantly  appeased. 

"  That  which  the  virtuous  Rama  desires,  do  thou  carry  out 
scrupulously  so  that  his  wrath  be  softened ;  execute  his  wishes 
with  care,  O  King,  fulfil  thy  pledge  and  be  true  to  thy  word  !  " 


CHAPTER     32 

Hanuman's  Speech 

At  these  words  of  Angada  and  his  ministers,  Sugriva,  learning 
of  Lakshmana's  anger,  rose  from  his  seat  and  came  to  himself. 

Having  considered  the  different  aspects  of  the  matter,  he 
addressed  his  counsellors,  who  were  versed  in  the  sacred 
formulas,  with  which  he  too  was  conversant  and  of  which  he 
was  a  strict  observer,  saying : — 

"  I  have  neither  spoken  nor  acted  wrongfully;  why  is  the 
brother  of  Raghava,  Lakshmana,  incensed  against  me,  I  ask 
254 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

myself?  Evilly  disposed  persons,  enemies  ever  looking  for  an 
occasion  to  charge  me  with  imaginary  crimes,  have  set  the 
younger  brother  of  Raghava  against  me.  It  behoves  ye  all  to 
reflect  on  the  matter  wisely  in  order  to  discover  the  cause  of  his 
anger.  Assuredly  I  do  not  fear  Lakshmana  any  more  than 
Raghava,  but  a  friend  who  becomes  angry  without  reason 
invariably  creates  anxiety.  It  is  easy  to  contract  a  friendship, 
but  extremely  difficult  to  sustain  it,  for  owing  to  the  fickleness  of 
the  mind  a  friendship  can  be  broken  for  the  most  trivial  reason. 
Because  of  this,  I  am  apprehensive  in  regards  to  the  magnani- 
mous Rama,  for  I  have  not  been  able  to  render  back  a 
proportionate  service  to  him  for  that  which  he  has  done  for 
me." 

Sugriva  having  spoken,  Hanuman,  that  foremost  of  monkeys, 
answered  according  to  his  understanding,  saying  : — 

"  It  is  in  no  way  surprising,  O  Chief  of  the  Monkey  Tribes, 
that  thou  art  unable  to  forget  the  significant  and  unexpected 
service  rendered  to  thee  by  Rama.  Assuredly  that  hero,  for  thy 
well-being,  fearlessly  slew  Bali,  equal  to  Indra  in  power.  Un- 
doubtedly Rama's  feelings  have  been  wounded,  which  is 
evidenced  by  his  sending  his  brother  Lakshmana,  the  increaser 
of  his  happiness,  as  his  deputy,  to  thee.  O  Thou,  the  most 
skilled  in  discerning  the  seasons,  autumn  is  here  in  all  her  glory, 
the  Saptacchada  and  Shyama  trees  being  in  full  flower,  but 
thou,  given  up  to  pleasure,  doth  not  perceive  it.  The  sky,  free 
from  cloud,  is  filled  with  brilliant  stars  and  planets,  and  on  all 
the  regions,  lakes  and  rivers,  calm  prevails. 

"The  time  has  come  to  inaugurate  the  search  for  Sita  of  which 
thou  art  conversant,  O  Bull  among  Monkeys.  Finding  thee 
forgetful,  Lakshmana  has  come  to  inform  thee  that  the  hour  is 
at  hand.  Grieving  over  the  abduction  of  his  spouse,  the 
magnanimous  Rama  will  speak  harshly  to  thee  through  the 
lips  of  this  hero  ;  is  it  a  cause  for  wonder  ?  Having  acted  im- 
properly towards  him,  I  see  no  other  means  tending  to  thy 
welfare  but  to  offer  obeisance  to  Lakshmana  and  crave  his 
pardon. 

"  It  is  the  duty  of  counsellors  to  utter  what  is  true  freely  to  a 
king  and  it  is  for  this  that  after  mature  reflection  I  have  spoken 
thus. 

*55 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Armed  with  his  bow,  Rama,  in  his  wrath,  is  able  to  subdue 
the  whole  world  as  also  the  Gods,  the  Asuras  and  the  Gand- 
harvas.  It  is  unwise  to  provoke  one  of  whom  subsequently 
forgiveness  must  be  craved,  the  more  so,  when  the  recollection 
of  a  favour  received  places  one  under  the  obligation  of  gratitude. 
Therefore  incline  thine  head  before  this  man  with  thy  son  and 
thine  entourage,  O  King,  and  remain  faithful  to  thy  promise,  as 
a  woman  to  her  husband's  will.  It  is  ill-advised  of  thee  to  oppose 
Rama's  behests,  even  in  thought,  for  thou  art  well  aware  of  this 
man's  power,  whose  prowess  is  equal  to  Indra  and  the  Gods." 


chapter    33 

Tara  pacifies  Lakshmana 

At  Angada's  request,  and  in  accord  with  Rama's  command, 
Lakshmana,  the  slayer  of  hostile  warriors,  entered  the  beautiful 
city  of  Kishkindha  situated  amidst  caves. 

Seeing  Lakshmana  approaching,  the  highly  powerful  monkeys 
of  immense  size  guarding  the  gate,  stood  with  joined  palms  and 
beholding  the  son  of  Dasaratha  filled  with  wrath,  breathing 
heavily,  dared  not  obstruct  his  entry. 

Then  that  mighty  warrior,  gazing  about  him,  beheld  that  great 
city  decorated  with  jewels  and  flowery  gardens  and  rendered 
magnificent  by  heaps  of  precious  stones  with  which  it  was  filled ; 
abounding  in  spacious  buildings  and  temples,  with  jewels  of 
every  kind  in  abundance  offered  as  merchandise,  it  was  em- 
bellished by  flowering  trees  covered  with  every  desirable  fruit. 

Born  of  the  Gods  and  Gandharvas,  monkeys,  able  to  change 
their  form  at  will,  wearing  celestial  garlands  and  raiment,  added 
to  the  beauty  of  the  city  by  their  charming  appearance. 

Fragrant  with  the  scent  of  sandalwood,  aloes  and  lotus,  the 
broad  highways  were  also  filled  with  the  intoxicating  odour  of 
Maireya  and  Madhu1. 

1  Wines  made  from  honey. 

256 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

Lakshmana  beheld  great  mansions  also,  as  high  as  the  Vindhya 
and  Meru  mountains,  and  streams  of  pure  water  flowing  through 
the  city.  He  surveyed  the  enchanting  abodes  of  Angada, 
Mainda,  Dvivida,  Gavaya,  Gavaksha,  Gaja,  Sharabha,  Vidhumati, 
Sampati,  Suryaksha,  Hanuman,  Virabahu,  Subahu  and  the 
great  souled  Nala,  Kumuda,  Sushena,  Tara,  Jambavan,  Dadhi- 
baktra,  Nila,  Sunetra  and  Supatala,  dwellings  like  unto  white 
clouds  adorned  with  fragrant  garlands  and  filled  with  jewels, 
grain  and  lovely  women. 

The  magnificent  and  inaccessible  abode  of  the  King  of 
Monkeys,  like  the  palace  of  Mahendra,  stood  on  a  white  rock  and 
was  decorated  with  pinnacled  domes  resembling  the  peaks  of 
Mt.  Kailasha.  Trees  in  full  flower,  bearing  fruits  of  every  kind 
of  delicious  flavour,  had  been  planted  there  and  resembled  blue 
clouds,  enchanting  with  their  cool  shade,  celestial  blooms  and 
golden-hued  fruit. 

Valiant  monkeys,  bearing  weapons  in  their  hands,  guarded  the 
resplendent  gateway,  the  arches  of  which  were  of  fine  gold 
adorned  with  magnificent  garlands. 

The  mighty  Lakshmana  entered  Sugriva's  palace  without 
hindrance  as  the  sun  enters  a  great  cloud,  and  having  traversed 
the  seven  courtyards,  filled  with  conveyances  and  seats,  he  beheld 
the  inner  apartments  of  that  Chief  of  the  Monkeys  abounding 
in  gold  and  silver  couches  with  rich  coverlets  and  fine  seats. 

On  entering  there,  he  heard  sweet  music  blending  with  the 
rhythmic  cadence  of  singing  to  the  accompaniment  of  stringed 
instruments;  and  in  the  private  apartments  of  Sugriva,  many  a 
high-born  woman,  distinguished  for  her  youth  and  beauty, 
sumptuously  attired,  crowned  with  flowers  and  engaged  in 
weaving  garlands  was  observed  by  the  high-souled  Lakshmana. 
He  noted  too,  that  there  were  none  of  the  king's  attendants, 
who  were  not  richly  apparelled,  happy,  well  fed  and  eager  to 
offer  their  services. 

Hearing  the  sound  of  the  women's  anklets  and  girdles,  the 
virtuous  Lakshmana  became  confused  and  incensed  by  the 
tinkling  of  those  ornaments ;  and  that  hero  stretched  the  cord 
of  his  bow  so  that  the  twanging  resounded  on  all  sides.  There- 
after the  valiant  Lakshmana,  indignant  on  Rama's  account, 
withdrew  into  a  corner  and  stood  silent,  reflecting  on  his 
257 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

presumption  in  entering  Sugriva's  private  apartments.  Hearing 
the  twanging  of  the  bow,  Sugriva,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys, 
recognizing  the  presence  of  Lakshmana,  began  to  tremble  on  his 
splendid  throne. 

He  reflected  :  '  As  Angada  previously  informed  me,  Saumitri, 
through  brotherly  solicitude,  has  undoubtedly  come  hither.' 

Then  that  monkey,  informed  by  Angada,  his  tidings  now  made 
doubly  sure  by  the  sound  of  the  bow,  understood  that  Lakshmana 
had  come  and  he  grew  pale,  his  heart  being  filled  with  appre- 
hension, and  Sugriva,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  addressed 
Tara,  of  charming  appearance,  in  well  considered  words 
saying : — 

"  O  Lady  of  Lovely  Eyebrows,  what  cause  for  displeasure 
has  the  younger  brother  of  Rama,  who  is  gentle  by  nature  ? 
Why  has  he  come  hither  like  a  raving  madman  ?  Dost  thou 
know  the  reason  of  this  prince's  anger  ?  Assuredly  that  lion 
among  men  cannot  be  enraged  without  cause.  If  we  have  un- 
wittingly displeased  him,  then  considering  the  matter  carefully, 
inform  me  without  delay  or  go  thyself  to  him. 

"  O  Lovely  One,  by  thy  sweet  speech  seek  to  conciliate  him. 
Seeing  thee,  his  mind  will  become  tranquil  and  his  anger  be 
allayed,  for  great  warriors  do  not  permit  themselves  to  treat 
women  with  harshness.  When  thy  gentle  words  have  soothed 
him  and  his  mind  and  senses  are  under  control,  then  I,  in  my  turn, 
will  approach  that  prince,  whose  eyes  are  as  large  as  lotus  petals 
and  who  is  the  conqueror  of  his  foes." 

On  this,  Tara,  swaying  slightly,  her  eyes  bright  from  the 
drinking  of  wine,  her  girdle  loosened,  hanging  by  a  golden  thread, 
wearing  the  insignia  of  royalty,  with  downcast  looks  approached 
Lakshmana.  And  when  that  great  warrior  beheld  the  consort 
of  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  he,  restraining  his  wrath  in  the 
presence  of  a  woman,  bowed  his  head,  conducting  himself  like 
an  ascetic. 

Under  the  influence  of  wine  and  observing  the  benign  attitude 
of  that  Prince,  Tara,  discarding  all  diffidence,  addressed  him  in  a 
conciliatory  manner,  in  words  calculated  to  gain  his  confidence 
and  said : — 

"  From  whence  springs  this  anger,  O  Son  of  a  King  ?  Who 
has  failed  to  carry  out  thine  orders  ?  What  reckless  person  has 
258 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

approached  the  forest  where  the  trees  are  dry  with  a  flaming 
torch  ?  " 

Mollified  by  this  sort  speech,  Lakshmana  replied  with  studied 
courtesy : — 

"  Why,  given  over  to  lust,  does  thy  consort  neglect  his  duty 
and  his  own  true  interests  ?  And  thou,  who  art  devoted  to  him, 
why  dost  thou  not  give  the  matter  thy  consideration  ?  He  has 
become  indifferent  to  the  affairs  of  the  kingdom  and  of  ourselves 
and  our  displeasure.  Surrounded  by  parasites,  O  Tara,  he 
gives  himself  up  to  sensual  enjoyments. 

"  The  four  months  appointed  as  the  term  of  waiting  have 
passed,  but  the  King  of  the  Monkeys  in  an  orgy  of  drunken- 
ness and  pleasure,  is  unaware  of  it.  Assuredly  dissipation  is 
not  a  proper  means  to  the  observance  of  one's  duty  and  obliga- 
tions. Intemperance  brings  in  its  train  the  loss  of  wealth, 
virtue  and  the  capacity  for  enjoyment. 

"  Not  to  requite  a  service  received  is  to  fail  wholly  in  one's  duty 
and  to  lose  a  good  friend  is  immensely  injurious  to  one's  higher 
interests.  From  the  point  of  view  of  prosperity,  the  greatest 
of  virtues  is  friendship  that  is  rooted  in  loyalty  and  justice ;  he 
who  rails  in  these  is  not  fixed  in  his  duty.  This  being  so, 
what  should  therefore  be  done,  O  Thou,  who  art  conversant  with 
the  path  of  duty  ?  " 

Hearing  these  just  and  reasonable  words,  expressed  with 
gentleness,  Tara  assured  the  prince  of  the  certain  fulfilment 
of  his  enterprise  and  again  addressed  Lakshmana  saying : — 

"  O  Son  of  a  King,  this  is  not  the  time  for  recrimination,  thou 
shouldst  restrain  thine  anger  against  my  lord;  he  has  thine 
interests  at  heart,  forgive  his  folly,  O  Warrior. 

"  O  Prince,  how  can  a  man  endowed  with  every  good  quality 
be  indignant  with  one  who  is  lacking  in  them  ?  Which  of  thine 
equals,  despite  his  good  character,  would  give  way  to  wrath  ? 
I  know  the  reason  for  the  displeasure  of  Sugriva's  valiant  ally, 
I  am  conversant  with  the  service  that  you  have  both  rendered  us 
and  which  we  must  return.  I  know  further,  O  Best  of  Men,  that 
one  must  master  one's  passions.  I  am  aware  in  what  company 
Sugriva  has  yielded  to  lust,  which  is  the  cause  of  the  present  pro- 
crastination that  incites  thy  wrath.  When  man  yields  to  desire 
he  forgets  time  and  place  as  also  his  duty  and  what  should  rightfully 
259  s 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

be  done.  Do  thou  pardon  this  Leader  of  the  Monkey  Race, 
who,  at  my  side,  without  shame,  gives  himself  up  to  sensual 
enjoyment  to  which  he  is  the  slave.  Even  the  great  Rishis, 
devoted  to  the  practice  of  asceticism,  when  carried  away  by 
desire,  lost  control  of  their  minds,  how  should  this  monkey, 
.therefore,  volatile  by  nature,  when  overcome  by  passion,  not 
become  a  slave  to  pleasure,  king  though  he  be  ?  " 

Having  addressed  these  words  of  profound  understanding  to 
Lakshmana,  whose  courage  was  immeasurable,  the  gentle 
Vanari,  with  a  troubled  look,  on  account  of  her  conjugal 
affection,  then  added  for  the  good  of  her  lord  : — 

"  O  Most  Excellent  of  Men,  though  overcome  by  desire, 
Sugriva  has  long  since  made  preparation  to  thine  advantage. 
Already  hundreds,  thousands  and  millions  of  valiant  monkeys, 
able  to  change  their  form  at  will,  inhabiting  every  kind  of  tree, 
have  come  here. 

"  Be  pleased  to  enter,  therefore,  O  Long-armed  Warrior;  the 
chaste  conduct  of  a  sincere  friend  authorizes  him  to  look  on  the 
wives  of  others." 

At  Tara's  invitation  and  urged  by  a  desire  to  carry  out  the 
commands  that  had  been  laid  upon  him,  that  illustrious  hero, 
the  conqueror  of  his  foes,  entered  the  inner  apartment. 

There,  seated  on  a  golden  throne,  covered  with  a  rich  cloth, 
he  beheld  Sugriva,  resembling  the  sun  itself,  his  person  decked 
with  celestial  ornaments,  of  a  godlike  beauty  and  dignity. 
Wearing  superb  raiment  and  wreaths  he  looked  like  Mahendra 
himself,  on  every  side  he  was  surrounded  by  women  adorned 
with  crowns  and  jewels  meet  for  goddesses,  and  his  reddened 
eyes  gave  him  the  appearance  of  Antaka. 

Of  the  hue  of  fine  gold,  clasping  Ruma  firmly  in  his  arms, 
seated  on  a  magnificent  throne,  that  large-eyed  hero  saw  before 
him  the  mighty  Saumitri  of  expansive  eyes.

CHAPTER     34 

Lakshmana  reproaches  Sugriva 

Seeing  that  indomitable  lion  among  men,  Lakshmana,  entering 
full  of  wrath,  Sugriva  was  troubled  and,  observing  that  Son  of 
Dasaratha  breathing  heavily  and  burning  with  indignation  on 
account  of  the  calamity  that  had  overtaken  his  brother,  the 
King  of  the  Monkeys  rose  and,  leaving  his  golden  seat  that  re- 
sembled the  highly  decorated  standard  of  Indra,  his  eyes 
inflamed,  approached  Prince  Lakshmana  and  stood  before  him 
like  the  mighty  Kalpa  tree.1  Thereupon  the  women,  lead  by 
Ruma,  followed  him,  like  a  cluster  of  stars  surrounding  the 
moon. 

Then  Lakshmana,  filled  with  ire,  said  to  Sugriva  standing 
amidst  the  women  with  Ruma  at  his  side,  like  the  moon  sur- 
rounded by  stars : — 

"  That  king  who  is  endowed  with  great  and  noble  qualities 
and  is  compassionate,  who  has  subdued  his  senses  and  is  grateful 
and  loyal,  obtains  renown  in  the  world,  but  the  monarch 
who  is  rooted  in  unrighteousness  and  is  unjust  to  his  friends 
who  have  rendered  him  assistance,  is  the  object  of  opprobrium, 
"  To  utter  a  falsehood  with  reference  to  a  horse  is  to  be 
guilty  of  the  death  of  a  hundred  horses,  in  regard  to  a  cow  of  a 
thousand  cows,  but  to  utter  a  falsehood  in  regard  to  a  man  is  to 
destroy  one's  self  as  well  as  one's  kindred. 

"  That  ungrateful  wretch,  who,  having  gained  his  end,  does 
not  render  service  for  service,  is  guilty  of  the  murder  of  all 
beings,  O  King  of  the  Plavagas ;  this  is  the  text  recited  by 
Brahma  on  beholding  one  who  was  guilty  of  ingratitude  ;  it  is 
known  throughout  the  world,  O  Plavamgama.  He  who  kills  a 
cow  or  drinks  intoxicating  liquor  or  is  a  thief  or  violates  his  vow  is 
still  able  to  expiate  his  sin,  but  for  him  who  is  guilty  of  in- 
gratitude, no  expiation  is  possible. 

"  Thou  art  an  ignoble,  false  and  ungrateful  wretch,  O  Monkey, 
for  having  obtained  what  thou  didst  seek  from  Rama  without 
requiting  his  services.    Having  achieved  thy  desire  through

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Rama,  is  it  not  thy  duty  to  do  everything  in  thy  power  to  recover 
Sita  ?  Yielding  thyself  up  to  sensual  delights,  untrue  to  thy 
promise,  Rama  does  not  know  thee  for  the  serpent  croaking 
like  a  frog,  that  thou  art.1 

"  In  his  compassion  for  thee,  O  Wicked  Wretch,  the  magnani- 
mous Rama  enabled  thee  to  regain  the  kingdom  of  the  monkeys. 
Thou  hast  failed  to  acknowledge  the  benefits  conferred  on  thee  by 
the  high-souled  Raghava,  therefore  pierced  by  sharp  arrows 
thou  shalt  follow  Bali.  The  path  thy  brother  took  at  death 
is  not  yet  closed !  Honour  thy  promise,  O  Sugriva,  do  not 
follow  in  his  wake.  Since  thou  dost  not  behold  the  Prince  of  the 
Ikshwakus  loosing  his  fiery  shafts,  thou  art  still  able  to  remain 
serene  and  happy,  without  concerning  thyself  about  his 
anxieties." 


CHAPTER      35 

Tara  defends  Sugriva 

Thus  spoke  Lakshmana,  the  son  of  Sumitra,  inflamed  with 
anger  and  Tara,  whose  face  was  as  fair  as  the  moon,  answered 
him  saying : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys  has  not  merited 
this  harsh  language,  particularly  from  thy  lips.  Sugriva  is  not 
ungrateful  nor  false  nor  worthy  of  condemnation  nor,  O  Hero, 
does  he  utter  what  is  not  true  nor  is  he  an  impostor ! 

"  The  valiant  monkey,  Sugriva,  has  not  forgotten  the  assist- 
ance rendered  to  him  by  Rama  on  the  field  of  battle,  which  no 
other  was  able  to  give.  With  the  aid  of  the  magnanimous 
Rama,  Sugriva  has  regained  his  glory  and  the  lasting  dominion 
of  the  monkey  realm  and  has  been  restored  to  Ruma  and  myself 
once  again,  O  Scourge  of  thy  Foes  ! 

"  Having  been  subject  to  cruel  adversity  and  now  enjoying 
the  summit  of  good  fortune,  he  has  become  insensible  to  the 
arrival  of  the  time  for  the  fulfilment  of  his  promise,  as  was  the 
Sage  Vishwamitra  of  old.   For  ten  years,  that  virtuous  Sage  was 

1  The  meaning  being  "croaking  like  a  frog  to  attracts  frogs." 
262 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

attached  to  the  nymph  Ghritachi  and  failed  to  perceive  that  time 
was  passing,  he,  who  was  skilled  in  discerning  time.1 

"  Sugriva  had  been  deprived  of  physical  pleasures  over  a  long 
period,  he  was  exhausted  and  had  not  experienced  any  relaxa- 
tion, O  Lakshmana,  therefore  Rama  should  pardon  him.  And 
thou,  O  Lakshmana,  shouldst  not  give  way  to  wrath  like  an 
inferior  person  without  ascertaining  what  has  taken  place. 
Virtuous  people  like  thee,  O  Lion  among  Men,  do  not  give  way  to 
immediate  and  unreasoning  anger.  In  all  humility,  I  appeal 
to  thee  on  behalf  of  Sugriva  to  control  the  grief  that  gives  rise 
to  this  anger  in  thee.  It  is  my  firm  conviction  that  Sugriva  is 
ready  to  renounce  Ruma,  Angada,  myself,  kingdom,  wealth, 
grain  and  herds  to  please  Rama.  Having  slain  that  vile  demon, 
Sugriva  will  restore  Sita  to  Rama,  as  the  moon  is  re-united  with 
Rohini. 

"  In  Lanka  there  are  hundreds,  thousands  and  millions  of 
irrepressible  demons  able  to  change  their  shape  at  will ;  without 
destroying  these  formidable  beings,  it  is  impossible  to  overcome 
Ravana,  by  whom  Maithili  has  been  borne  away.  Sugriva  is 
unable  to  defeat  those  demons  of  terrible  exploits  without  the 
support  of  auxiliaries,  O  Lakshmana.  This  was  Bali's  con- 
sidered opinion,  that  resourceful  and  experienced  monarch  of 
the  monkeys.  Knowing  nought  of  the  matter,  I  heard  it  from 
his  lips. 

"  In  order  to  render  thee  assistance,  the  foremost  of  the 
monkeys  have  been  summoned  for  this  enterprise  with  in- 
numerable carefully  selected  troops.  Awaiting  those  valiant 
and  powerful  monkeys,  chosen  to  assure  the  success  of  Rama's 
undertaking,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys  has  not  yet  left  the  city. 
"  O  Lakshmana,  some  time  ago  Sugriva,  wisely  ordered  that 
these  monkeys  should  come  together  this  very  day.  Thousands 
and  millions  of  bears  and  hundreds  of  Golangulas4  as  well  as 
innumerable  kotis3  of  monkeys,  burning  with  energy,  will  be  at 
thy  disposal  to-day. 

"  Therefore  O  Conqueror  of  Thy  Foes,  subdue  thy  wrath. 
Seeing  thy  face  distorted  with  anger  and  thine  eyes  inflamed, 

1  This  story  is  told  in  Balakanda.

the  wives  of  these  foremost  of  monkeys,  far  from  being  reassured, 
are  suffering  all  the  anguish  of  their  former  fear." 


chapter    36 

Lakshmana  is  reconciled  to  Sugriva 

By  nature  gentle,  Lakshmana  listened  to  those  just  and  gracious 
words  of  Tara  with  deference. 

Perceiving  the  magnanimous  acceptance  of  her  speech,  the 
King  of  the  Monkeys  threw  off  his  fear  as  one  discards  wet 
clothing.  Thereafter  Sugriva  tore  off  the  gaudy  and  variegated 
garland  from  his  neck  and  threw  it  away,  his  intoxication  being 
dissipated  and  that  Chief  of  the  Monkeys  addressed  the  re- 
doubtable warrior  Lakshmana  with  humility,  thus  gratifying 
him,  and  said : — 

"  O  Saumitri,  I  had  lost  my  fortune,  my  fame  and  the  kingdom 
of  the  monkeys  which  by  Rama's  favour  have  been  wholly 
restored  to  me.  Who  is  able  to  equal  this  or  render  it  back  even 
in  part  to  that  divine  Rama,  renowned  for  his  exploits,  O  Prince? 
The  virtuous  Raghava  will  recover  Sita  and  slay  Ravana  by  his 
own  valour  alone ;  as  for  me,  I  shall  merely  accompany  him. 
What  need  of  assistance  has  he  who,  with  a  single  arrow  pierced 
seven  giant  trees  and  a  mountain,  penetrating  deep  into  the 
earth  ?  He  by  the  sound  of  whose  stretching  bow  the  earth 
with  its  mountains  quakes,  what  need  has  he  for  aid  ?  I  shall 
follow  that  Indra  among  Men,  O  Lakshmana,  when  he  goes 
forth  to  destroy  his  adversary,  Ravana,  together  with  his 
House. 

"  If  I  have  betrayed  his  friendship  or  confidence  in  some 
measure,  may  he  pardon  me;  is  there  any  without  fault  ?  " 

These  words  of  the  magnanimous  Sugriva  pleased  Laksh- 
mana who  addressed  him  affectionately,  saying : — 

"  Assuredly  my  brother  will  not  lack  support,  O  Prince  of  the 
Monkeys,  above  all,  O  Sugriva,  with  thy  co-operation,  who  art 
full  of  humility.  Such  is  thy  valour  and  sincerity,  that  thou 
art  worthy  of  enjoying  the  unequalled  prosperity  of  the  monkey 
realm. 

264 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

"  With  thine  aid,  undoubtedly,  O  Sugriva,  the  illustrious 
Rama  will  soon  slay  his  enemies  in  battle.  Virtuous,  mindful 
of  what  should  be  done,  intrepid  in  the  field,  thou  utterest  noble 
words  that  are  worthy  of  thee,  O  Friend.  Who  else,  recognizing 
his  fault,  at  the  height  of  his  power,  would  speak  thus,  O  Bull 
among  the  Monkeys,  save  mine  elder  brother  and  thee  ? 

"  Thou  art  equal  to  Rama  in  courage  and  strength  !  Thou 
has  been  ordained  his  ally  by  the  Gods,  O  Chief  of  the  Monkeys. 
Why  delay  further,  O  Hero,  let  us  go  forth  together  and  offer 
consolation  to  thy  friend,  who  is  afflicted  on  account  of  separa- 
tion from  his  consort. 

"  O  Sugriva,  forgive  those  reproaches  that  I  addressed  to  thee 
on  account  of  Rama's  profound  distress." 


chapter    37 

Sugriva  assembles  his  Troops 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  magnanimous  Lakshmana,  Sugriva 
said  to  Hanuman  who  stood  near  : — 

"  Call  together  all  those  who  inhabit  the  heights  of  the 
Mahendra,  Himavat,  Vindhya,  Kailasha  and  Mandara  mountains, 
as  also  those  from  the  peaks  of  Mt.  Pandu  and  the  Five  Hills ; 
those  who  dwell  on  the  mountains  that  are  bright  as  the  dawn; 
those  who  inhabit  the  furthest  shores  of  the  sea  in  the  western 
region  and  those  on  the  mountains  in  the  mansions  of  the  sun ; 
those  formidable  monkeys  who  have  taken  refuge  in  the  Pad- 
machalu  woods ;  those  monkeys  resembling  clouds  of  collyrium, 
who  possess  the  strength  of  die  lord  of  elephants,  who  dwell 
on  the  Anjana  hill ;  those  possessing  the  splendour  of  gold, 
inhabiting  the  caves  of  the  Mahashaila  mountains  and  those  who 
frequent  the  slopes  of  Mt.  Mem,  as  well  as  those  dwelling  on 
Mt.  Dhumra ;  those  who  possess  the  brilliance  of  the  rising  sun, 
of  immense  bounds,  who,  on  the  Mt.  Maharuna,  drink  the  heady 
wine  Maireya ;  those  who  dwell  in  the  vast,  fair  and  fragrant 
forests  with  their  charming  glades,  where  the  ascetics' hermitages 
are  found.  With  the  aid  of  the  fleetest  of  monkeys  summon 
265 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

them  all  from  every  quarter  of  the  world  by  means  of  gifts 
and  conciliation,  Already  I  have  sent  out  messengers  who 
are  famed  for  their  agility,  yet,  in  order  to  expedite  matters 
further,  let  them  be  followed  by  other  emissaries. 

"  Bring  those  leaders  of  monkeys  also,  who  are  lazy  or  given 
over  to  pleasure.  If  they  have  not  responded  to  my  appeal  in 
ten  days,  they  will  suffer  the  death  penalty  for  infringing  the 
royal  command.  Let  those  lions  among  monkeys  under  my 
dominion  carry  out  my  orders  with  all  speed  in  their  hundreds, 
thousands  and  millions. 

"  Resembling  mountains  of  mist  shrouding  the  heavens,  let 
those  excellent  monkeys  of  terrifying  aspect  come  at  my  call. 
Let  all  the  monkeys  who  are  acquainted  with  the  way,  scour  the 
earth ;  call  them  together  at  my  command  with  all  speed." 

At  the  words  of  the  Monkey  King,  the  Son  of  the  Wind  dis- 
patched groups  of  intelligent  monkeys  to  every  quarter.  Setting 
out  to  that  region  traversed  by  Vishnu,  by  the  paths  fre- 
quented by  birds  and  stars,  the  monkeys,  under  the  commands  of 
their  sovereign  set  forth  immediately. 

Scouring  the  seas,  mountains,  forests  and  lakes,  they  called 
all  the  different  monkeys  together  to  help  Rama.  When  these 
monkeys  heard  of  Sugriva's  order,  a  very  death  warrant,  they,  in 
fear,  at  once  set  out  for  Kishkindha. 

Those  of  the  Flavagama  Tribe,  who  were  as  black  as  coUyrium, 
filled  with  energy,  came  from  the  Mt.  Anjana  to  the  number  of 
three  kotis  to  join  Rama.  Those  who  frolicked  on  the  high 
hills,  where  the  sun  sets,  shining  like  gold,  offered  themselves  in 
ten  kotis.  From  the  heights  of  Mt.  Kailasha,  monkeys  whose 
colour  resembled  a  lion's  mane,  came  to  the  number  of  a 
thousand  and  those  who  lived  on  fruit  and  roots,  who  dwelt 
on  Himavat  came  in  tens  of  millions,  whilst  those  terrible  apes 
of  fearful  deeds,  resembling  burning  coals,  descended  in  haste 
from  the  Vindhya  mountain  in  thousands  of  millions.  Those 
who  dwelt  on  the  shores  of  the  white  sea,  the  dwellers  of  the 
Tamala  forests  and  those  who  fed  on  coconuts  could  not  be 
numbered. 

From  woods,  caves  and  rivers,  a  vast  army  of  monkeys  issued 
forth,  who  seemed  able  to  drink  up  the  sun's  rays.  Now  those 
mighty  monkeys,  who  had  gone  out  in  all  haste  to  spur  others  on, 
266 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

found  a  great  tree  growing  on  the  summit  of  Mt.  Himavat.  In 
ancient  times  on  that  divine  and  sacred  peak,  a  great  sacrifice 
had  been  performed  which  found  favour  with  Mahadeva,  who 
satisfies  all  the  desires  of  the  Gods.  Thereafter  many  varieties 
of  fruit  and  roots  resembling  ambrosia  had  sprung  up  in  that 
quarter  from  the  sacred  offerings  of  grain  and  seed,1  and  those 
who  partook  of  them  had  no  need  of  further  sustenance  for  the 
period  of  a  whole  month. 

Then  those  foremost  among  the  monkeys  gathered  those 
celestial  fruits  and  roots  with  medicinal  herbs  from  that  place  of 
sacrifice  and  they  brought  fragrant  flowers  also  to  please  Sugriva. 

Having  called  all  the  monkeys  of  the  world  together,  those 
chosen  messengers  returned  with  speed  at  the  head  of  their 
troops  and  soon  those  fleet  and  spirited  monkeys  had  returned  to 
Kishkindha,  where  Sugriva  was ;  and  they  presented  him 
with  the  fruit,  herbs  and  roots  that  they  had  gathered,  saying  : — 

"  We  have  scoured  the  mountains,  rivers  and  forests  ;  all  the 
monkeys  of  the  earth  have  come  at  thy  call." 

These  words  pleased  Sugriva,  the  King  of  the  Monkey  Tribe, 
who  freely  accepted  all  the  gifts  they  had  brought. 


CHAPTER     38 

Sugriva  goes  to  meet  Rama 

Sugriva,  having  accepted  the  gifts  presented  to  him,  thanked  the 
monkeys  and  dismissed  them  all. 

Having  sent  away  those  thousands  of  monkeys,  who  had  per- 
formed their  task,  he  deemed  his  mission,  as  that  of  the  mighty 
Raghava,  well  nigh  accomplished. 

Thereupon  Lakshmana  addressed  the  redoubtable  Sugriva, 
the  foremost  of  monkeys,  with  a  deference  which  moved  him, 
saying : — "  O  Friend,  be  pleased  to  set  out  from  Kishkindha." 

1  That  had  been  scattered  there. 

267 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Hearing  these  words  spoken  by  Shri  Lakshmana,  Sugriva 
filled  with  joy  answered : — "  Be  it  so,  let  us  go  forward,  I  am  at 
thy  command." 

Having  thus  spoken  to  the  illustrious  Lakshmana,  Sugriva 
dismissed  Tara  with  the  other  women  and  thereafter  summoning 
the  leaders  of  the  monkeys  in  a  loud  voice  addressed  them, 
saying  : — "  Come  hither !  " 

At  the  sound  of  his  voice  all  those  admitted  to  the  presence  of 
women  came  immediately  and  stood  with  joined  palms  before  the 
king,  whose  brilliance  equalled  the  sun's  and  who  said  to 
them : — 

"  Go  with  all  speed  and  bring  a  litter,  O  Monkeys  !  "  At 
this  command  they  set  out  with  rapid  strides  to  seek  that  mar- 
vellous litter  and,  when  it  was  made  ready,  the  supreme  Sovereign 
of  the  Monkeys  said  to  Saumitri : — "  Be  pleased  to  ascend  the 
litter.  O  Lakshmana  !  " 

Speaking  thus,  Sugriva  with  Lakshmana  mounted  the  golden 
litter  that  shone  like  the  sun  and  was  supported  by  a  large  number 
of  monkeys.  A  white  canopy  was  spread  over  Sugriva's  head 
and  magnificent  fans  made  of  yaks  tails  were  waved  about  him. 
Eulogized  by  bards,  to  the  sound  of  conches  and  trumpets,  he 
set  out  in  regal  state.  Surrounded  by  hundreds  of  war-like 
monkeys  bearing  weapons  in  their  hands  he  proceeded  to  the 
place  whereRama  dwelt  and,  having  arrived  at  that  excellent  spot, 
that  illustrious  prince  descended  from  the  litter  with  Lakshmana 
and  approached  Rama  with  joined  palms.  Then  the  monkeys, 
grouped  about  him,  did  likewise  and,  seeing  that  great  army  of 
monkeys  resembling  a  lake  covered  with  lotus  buds,  Rama  was 
well  pleased  with  Sugriva. 

Raising  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  who  had  prostrated  him- 
self before  him  and  whose  forehead  touched  his  feet,  the  virtuous 
Rama  embraced  him  to  demonstrate  his  affection  and  esteem 
and  requested  him  to  be  seated.  Thereafter  seeing  him  seated 
on  the  ground,  Rama  said  : — 

'*  He  who  divides  his  time  judiciously  between  duty,  pleasure 
and  the  legitimate  acquisition  of  wealth  and  honours  his  responsi- 
bilities in  these  things  is  truly  a  king,  O  Best  of  Monkeys ; 
but  he  who  neglects  his  duty,  his  true  interests  and  legitimate 
pleasures  is  like  one  who  sleeps  on  the  top  of  a  tree  and  does  not 
268*

wake  up  till  he  has  fallen.  The  monarch  who  is  ever  ready  to 
destroy  his  foes  and  delights  in  showing  favour  to  his  friends, 
who  plucks  the  fruit  of  the  threefold  food,1  has  fulfilled  his  duty. 

"  The  time  has  now  come  to  act,  O  Scourge  of  Thy  Foes, 
therefore  take  counsel  with  thy  ministers,  OKing  of  the  Apes !  " 

Thus  addressed,  Sugriva  answered  Rama,  saying : — "  I  had 
lost  tame  and  fortune  together  with  the  entire  monkey  realm, 
O  Long-armed  Warrior  but,  through  thy  favour  have  received 
them  again  by  thine  and  thy  brother's  grace,  O  Great  One, 
O  Greatest  of  the  Conquerors.  He  who  does  not  acknowledge 
a  service  done  to  him  is  an  object  of  contempt. 

*'  These  energetic  leaders  have  gone  out  in  their  hundreds  to 
summon  all  the  monkeys  in  the  world,  O  Slayer  of  thy  Foes. 
Monkeys,  bears  and  apes  full  of  valour,  of  ferocious  aspect, 
familiar  with  the  woods  and  inaccessible  forests,  monkeys  that 
are  born  of  the  Gods  and  Gandharvas,  able  to  change  their  shape 
at  will,  are  on  their  way  followed  by  their  troops,  O  Rama. 

"  These  monkeys  are  proceeding  here  surrounded  by  hundreds 
and  thousands,2  by  millions  and  tens  of  millions ;  these  monkeys 
and  their  chiefs,  who  are  as  valiant  as  Mahendra  and  resemble 
mountains  in  stature,  are  coming  together  from  the  Meru  and 
Vindhya  ranges.  They  will  unite  with  thee  to  fight  the  demon 
Ravana  and,  laying  him  low  on  the  battlefield,  will  restore  Sita 
to  thee." 

Seeing  the  preparations  made  by  that  valiant  monkey,  in 
accord  with  his  desire,  the  illustrious  prince  was  delighted  and 
his  countenance  resembled  the  blue  lotus  in  flower.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     39 

The  Arrival  of  Sugriva's  Forces 

Thus  spoke  Sugriva,  standing  with  joined  palms  before  Rama, 
and  that  most  virtuous  of  men,  taking  him  in  his  arms,  embraced 
him  saying : — "  It  is  no  wonder  that  Indra  sends  the  rain,  nor 
that  the  sun  with  its  thousand  rays  dispels  the  darkness  from  the 
sky,  O  My  dear  One,  nor  that  the  moon  by  its  brilliance  makes 
the  night  clear,  nor  that  thine  equals  create  the  happiness  of 
their  friends,  O  Scourge  of  Thy  Foes.  To  find  nobility  of 
character  in  thee  is  not  strange ;  I  know  thee  by  the  affectionate 
tenor  of  thy  speech.  With  thy  support,  O  My  Friend,  I  shall 
vanquish  all  my  foes  on  the  battlefield ;  thou  art  mine  ally  and 
shouldst  assist  me. 

"  To  his  own  destruction,  did  that  vile  demon  bear  Maithili 
away,  as  Anuhlada1  carried  away  Sachi,  having  first  deceived  her 
sire.*  Ere  long,  I  shall  pierce  Ravana  with  my  sharp  arrows  as 
Shatakratu,  that  slayer  of  his  enemies,  slew  the  haughty  father 
of  Paulomi." 

At  that  moment,  darkness  covered  the  firmament  and  veiled 
the  fiery  brilliance  of  that  orb  of  a  thousand  rays ;  a  pall  of  dust 
hung  over  all  regions,  and  the  earth  with  its  mountains,  forests 
and  woods  trembled.  The  entire  earth  was  covered  with  in- 
numerable monkeys  resembling  kings  of  men  and  who,  having 
sharp  teeth,  were  gifted  with  great  strength.  In  the  twinkling  of  an 
eye,  those  foremost  of  monkeys  surrounded  by  troops,  number- 
ing hundreds  of  kotis,  endowed  with  extreme  energy,  roaring 
like  thunder,  gathered  from  the  rivers,  mountains  and  seas  with 
others  who  inhabited  the  forests. 

Monkeys  the  colour  of  the  rising  sun  or  white  like  the  moon  or 
of  the  tint  of  lotus  stamens  or  pale,  having  their  home  on  the 
golden  mountain,  appeared  in  tens  of  thousands  in  attendance  on 
that  renowned  and  valiant  monkey  Shatavali.   Then  the  puissant

sire  of  Tara,  who  resembled  a  golden  hill,  appeared  at  the  head 
of  many  thousand  kotis.  Thereafter  the  father  of  Ruma,  father- 
in-law  of  Sugriva,  who  resembled  the  filaments  of  a  lotus  and 
was  like  a  youthful  sun,  arrived  accompanied  by  other  thousands 
of  kotis  of  monkeys ;  and  that  foremost  of  monkeys,  Kesharin, 
Hanuman's  illustrious  sire,  appeared  in  company  with  many 
thousands  of  monkeys.  And  Gavaksha,  King  of  the  Golangulas, 
endowed  with  dreadful  power  came,  surrounded  by  millions  of 
monkeys  ;  Dhumra  also,  the  destroyer  of  his  foes,  advanced  with 
two  thousand  bears  endowed  with  terrific  speed.  Thereafter 
the  leader  of  herds,  Panasha  of  exceeding  prowess  came,  ac- 
companied by  three  million  mighty  and  dreadful  warriors  and 
he  was  followed  by  Nila  of  immense  stature,  who  resembled  a 
mass  of  collyrium,  with  ten  kotis  of  monkeys.  And  bright  as  a 
golden  mountain,  the  heroic  Gavaya  arrived  with  five  kotis  of 
monkeys,  and  in  his  devotion  to  Sugriva  the  brave  chief  Dari- 
mukha  brought  a  thousand  kotis.  Thereafter  the  two  powerful 
Ashwiputras,  Mainda  and  Dvivida  presented  themselves  with  a 
thousand  million  monkeys.  The  brave  warrior  Gaja  conducted 
an  army  of  three  kotis  of  monkeys,  and  the  illustrious  king  of 
the  bears,  called  Jambavan,  came  at  the  head  of  ten  kotis,  placing 
himself  under  Sugriva's  command.  The  renowned  Rumana 
followed  with  a  hundred  kotis  of  intrepid  monkeys  in  all  haste. 
A  hundred  thousand  million  monkeys  followed  Gandhamadana, 
and  an  infinite  number  were  under  the  command  of  Prince 
Angada,  who,  like  his  father,  was  full  of  courage.  Thereafter, 
shining  like  a  star,  came  Tara  of  supreme  valour,  accompanied 
by  five  kotis  of  monkeys  from  a  great  distance  and  there  followed 
Indrajanu,  a  brave  and  skilful  general,  who  in  his  turn  presented 
himself  at  the  head  of  eleven  kotis,  and  also  Rambha  with  an 
ayuta1  of  soldiers;  and  there  followed  the  monkey  leader 
Durmukha,  that  valiant  one  full  of  phenomenal  courage,  with 
two  kotis  of  monkeys,  resembling  the  peaks  of  Mt.  Kailasha. 
Hanuman  himself  was  accompanied  by  thousands  of  monkeys 
and  the  supremely  brave  Nala  was  followed  by  the  inhabitants 
of  the  woods  to  the  number  of  an  hundred,  a  thousand  and  an 
hundred  monkeys.  The  fortunate  Darimukha  was  escorted  by 
ten  kotis  of  monkeys  and  with  loud  shouts  took  his  place  beside 

1  Ayuta— » Ten  thousand,  a  myriad  or  a.  number  not  to  be  counted. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Sugriva.  And  Sharabha,  Kumuda,  Vahni  and  Rambha  came, 
those  monkeys  who  were  able  to  change  their  shape  at  will,  with 
their  forces  of  incalculable  numbers  covering  the  entire  earth, 
its  mountains  and  forests.  All  the  monkeys  inhabiting  the 
earth  gathered  round  Sugriva,  leaping,  gambolling  and  roaring, 
and  those  Plavagamas  surrounded  Sugriva  like  massed  clouds 
round  the  sun.  Full  of  courage  and  energy,  they  gave  voice  to 
repeated  shouts  of  acclamation,  bowing  their  heads  in  salutation 
to  the  King  of  Monkeys.  Others,  the  leaders  of  armies, 
according  to  tradition,  approached  the  king  and  stood  by  his  side 
with  joined  palms ;  and  Sugriva  standing  in  extreme  devotion 
before  Rama,  informed  him  of  the  arrival  of  the  monkeys  and 
then  addressed  his  generals,  who  were  burning  with  zeal, 
saying: — "O  Chiefs  of  Monkeys,  station  your  forces  duly  on  the 
mountain  near  rills  in  the  woods  and  let  each  ascertain  the 
exact  number  of  his  troops." 


CHAPTER     40 

Sugriva  sends  his  Monkeys  to  the  East  in  search  of  Sita 

Then  the  Lord  of  the  Monkeys,  his  purpose  accomplished,  said 
to  that  lion  among  men,  Rama,  the  destroyer  of  hostile  hosts : — 

"  Here,  gathered  together,  are  the  foremost  of  monkeys  in- 
habiting my  dominions,  who  are  equal  to  Mahendra  and  are 
able  to  transport  themselves  anywhere  at  will.  These  ferocious 
monkeys,  resembling  giants  and  titans,  of  immeasurable  prowess, 
renowned  for  their  exploits,  bellicose,  valiant,  indefatigable 
and  supremely  sagacious  in  all  their  deliberations,  have  come  with 
their  vast  forces. 

"  O  Rama,  these  untold  millions,  who  inhabit  various 
mountain  tracts,  traversing  land  and  sea,  have  come  to  place 
themselves  at  thy  service.  All  are  intent  on  their  master's 
welfare  and  obedient  to  thy  behests ;  they  are  at  thy  command, 
it  is  for  thee  to  dispose  of  them  as  thou  wilt.  Though  I  am 
fully  conversant  with  thy  design,  yet  do  thou  order  all  as  thou 
judgest  best." 

272 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

Thus  spoke  Sugriva  and  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  taking 
him  in  his  arms,  said  to  him : — 

"  O  Dear  and  Wise  Friend,  let  us  learn  if  Sita  still  lives  or  no 
and  ascertain  in  what  country  Ravana  dwells.  Then,  having 
come  to  where  Videha's  daughter  is  to  be  found,  we  will  adopt 
those  measures  that  circumstances  dictate,  the  hour  having  been 
fixed. 

"  O  Lord  of  the  Monkeys,  it  is  not  for  me  to  command  this 
expedition  nor  for  Lakshmana;  it  is  thou  who  must  direct  it; 
thou  shalt  be  its  leader.  Do  thou,  O  Lord,  take  the  command 
thyself  in  this  matter,  thou  art  fully  acquainted  with  my  purpose, 
O  Hero.  Thou,  the  second  of  my  friends, 1  art  full  of  courage, 
wise,  knowing  how  to  choose  the  fitting  moment,  devoted  to  my 
true  interests,  supremely  loyal  and  accomplished." 

Thus  addressed,  Sugriva,  in  the  presence  of  Rama  and  the 
sagacious  Lakshmana,  said  to  his  general,  Vinata,  who  resembled 
a  great  hill  and  whose  voice  resounded  like  thunder : — 

"  O  Foremost  of  Leaders,  who  art  accompanied  by  monkeys 
as  bright  as  the  sun  and  moon,  thou  art  able  to  turn  time  and 
place  to  advantage  and  art  skilled  in  conducting  thine  affairs ! 
Taking  with  thee  hundreds  and  thousands  of  apes,  explore  the 
eastern  region  with  its  forests,  woods  and  mountains,  in  search 
of  Sita,  the  Princess  of  Videha  and  also  Ravana's  stronghold. 
Search  among  the  mountain  fastnesses,  the  forests  and  rivers 
for  Rama's  beloved  consort,  the  daughter-in-law  of  King 
Dasaratha  ;  search  by  the  beautiful  Bhagirathi,  the  Sarayu,  the 
Kaushiki  and  the  Kalindi,  the  enchanting  Yamuna  and  the  great 
hills  bordering  the  Saraswati,  the  Sindhu  and  the  Shona  of  ruby 
waters,  the  Mahi  and  Kalamahi  with  their  splendid  wooded  hills. 
"  Look  for  them  in  the  Brahmamalas,  Videhas,  Malavana, 
Kashikoshalas,  and  Magadhas,  the  Pundras  and  Angas,  lands 
where  the  silkworm  and  silver  mines  abound  and  on  the  mountains 
and  cities  skirting  the  sea.  Search  through  the  houses  in 
Mandara,  amongst  those  people  whose  ears  resemble  cloths 
reaching  to  their  nether  lip,  whose  faces  are  black  and  dreadful, 
who  are  one-footed,  though  fleet  withal,  and  whose  bodies  do 
not  deteriorate ;  those  also  who  feed  on  human  flesh, 
and  the  Kiratas,  hunters  who  are  golden-hued,  of  pleasing 

1  The  first  being  Lakshmana. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

looks,  possessing  thick  hair  worn  in  a  knot,  who  subsist  on  raw 
fish  and  those  creatures,  tiger-men,  terrible  to  behold. 

"  O  Dwellers  in  the  woods,  search  carefully  in  all  these 
places  that  are  accessible  by  climbing  and  swimming  and  the 
Island  of  the  Seven  Kingdoms  Yava,  also  and  the  islands 
Suvarna  and  Rupayaka,  full  of  gold  mines,  called  the  gold  and 
silver  islands.  Beyond  these,  is  the  mountain  Shishira,  whose 
peaks  reach  to  the  heavens,  and  which  is  inhabited  by  Gods  and 
Giants.  Seek  here  in  the  mountain  fastnesses,  cascades  and 
forests  for  the  glorious  consort  of  Rama. 

"  Thereafter  you  will  reach  the  red  and  swiftly  flowing  river 
Shona  ;  from  there  descend  to  the  seashore,  where  the  Siddhas 
and  Charanas  dwell.  In  these  enchanting  sacred  spots,  seek 
everywhere  for  Ravana  and  Sita.  Explore  the  forests,  mountain 
sprung  rivers,  wild  tracts  and  cavernous  heights.  It  behoves 
you  to  examine  the  terrible  islands  in  the  ocean,  where  great 
waves  arise  and,  whipped  by  the  tempest,  let  forth  a  thunderous 
roar.  There  dwell  Asuras  of  immense  size,  who  by  Brahma's 
permission,  seize  the  shadows  of  birds  flying  over  the  sea. 
Arriving  at  that  vast  ocean,  that  resounds  like  clouds  at  the  time 
of  the  dissolution  of  the  universe,  frequented  by  huge  serpents, 
keep  careful  watch  and  crossing  over  that  sea,  called  Lohita, 
whose  red  waters  are  terrible  to  behold,  you  will  come  upon  the 
mighty  knarled  ShamaU  tree.  There,  constructed  by  Vish- 
wakarma,  like  unto  Mt.  Kailasha,  decorated  with  every  kind  of 
gem,  towereth  the  abode  of  Garuda.  Terrible  demons  resembl- 
ing hills  of  diverse  forms,  named  Mandehas,  hang  suspended 
from  the  rocks  there.  Day  after  day,  at  the  rising  of  the  sun, 
those  demons  tormented  by  that  planet,  fall  into  the  water,  struck 
by  Brahma's  energy  and  then  suspend  themselves  on  the  rocks 
once  more. 

"  Proceeding  further,  you  will  come  to  the  sea,  named 
Kshiroda,  that  resembles  a  white  cloud  with  its  waves  shining 
like  a  necklace  of  pearls.  In  its  centre  rises  the  great 
white  mountain  Rishabha,  planted  with  trees,  bearing  fragrant 
blossoms  and  a  lake  named  Sudarshana  covered  with  dazzling 
silver  lotuses  having  golden  stamens,  where  flamingoes  abound. 
Vibudhas,  Charanas,  Yakshas  and  Kinneras  in  the  company  of 
troops  of  Apsaras,  disport  themselves  on  the  shore  of  that  lake. 
274 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

"  Leaving  the  Kshiroda  Sea  behind,  O  Warriors,  you  will 
come  to  the  Jalada  sea  which  is  a  source  of  terror  to  all  beings. 
There  the  Rishi  Aurva1  created  a  shining  object  by  the  power  of 
his  anger,  which  was  transformed  into  the  head  of  a  horse  by 
Brahma.  Its  heat  is  unequalled  and  its  food  is  the  universe  of 
movable  and  immovable  beings.  There  the  cries  of  the 
creatures  of  the  sea,  who  are  unable  to  bear  the  flames,  can  be 
heard  wailing  in  its  vicinity. 

"  To  the  north  of  the  Svadu  Sea  rises  the  high  mountain 
Jatarupashila,  covering  thirteen  yojanas,  of  the  splendour  of 
gold.  There,  O  Monkeys,  you  will  behold  the  supporters  of 
the  earth,  the  serpent  resembling  the  moon,  with  eyes  as  large 
as  lotus  petals,  worshipped  by  the  Gods,  and  possessing  a 
thousand  heads,  the  divine  Ananta  of  dark  hue  sleeping  on  the 
summit  of  the  mountain.  There  stands  a  golden  palm  tree 
with  three  branches  resembling  a  standard  set  upon  an  altar.  This 
is  the  boundary  of  the  Eastern  region  set  up  by  the  Gods. 

"  Reaching  up  to  the  heavens,  measuring  a  hundred  yojanas, 
the  mountain,  Udaya,  rises  with  its  golden  peak,  beautiful  with 
its  Sala,  Tamala  and  flowering  Karnikara  trees  bright  as  the  sun. 

"  There  also  is  the  peak  Saumanasa  four  miles  in  breadth  and 
forty  in  height.  From  there  in  former  days,  Vishnu,  the  supreme 
Lord,  measured  the  earth  with  three  strides,  the  second  being 
Mt.  Meru. 

"  The  sun  passing  from  Jambudwipa  on  the  north  and  reach- 
ing the  summit  of  Saumanasa,  again  becomes  visible  to  the 
dwellers  in  Jambudwipa.  It  is  there  that  the  great  Rishis, 
Vaikhanasas,  bright  as  the  sun,  perform  their  austerities. 

"  This  is  the  island  Sudarshana,  where  the  sun  rises,  giving 
light  to  all  beings.  Search  for  Janaki  and  Ravana  on  these 
mountain  fastnesses  and  in  the  forests  and  woods.  Here, 
when  the  sun  shines  on  the  Shaila  mountain,  the  east  appears 
roseate.  Because  the  sun  rises  there,  Brahma  established  it, 
in  ancient  times,  as  the  gateway  of  the  world,  called  the  East. 

1  A  miraculously  born  sage  who  castigated  the  warrior  class,  but  on  the 
persuasion  of  his  ancestors,  cast  hiB  anger  into  the  sea,  where  it  assumed

In  other  versions  it  was  said  to  be  the  subterranean  fire  that  consumes 
the  world  at  the  end  of  the  cycle  and  is  represented  as  a  flame  with  a  horse's 
head.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Here  you  should  look  for  Sita  and  Ravana  on  the  mountain 
breast,  in  the  caves  and  by  the  waterfalls. 

"  Beyond  is  the  impassable  eastern  quarter  inhabited  by  the 
Gods,  bereft  of  sun  and  moon,  covered  by  darkness.  Search 
for  the  princess  in  all  those  rocks,  woods  and  streams  that  I 
have  made  known  to  you,  but,  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  you  are 
only  able  to  proceed  thus  far.  Beyond  is  the  region  without  sun 
or  bourne  of  which  I  have  no  knowledge.  Proceeding  in  search 
of  Vaidehi  and  Havana's  abode,  having  reached  the  mountain 
Udaya,  return,  when  a  full  month  shall  have  passed.  Do  not 
exceed  the  period ;  he  who  does  so,  will  be  punished  by  death. 

"  Having  attained  your  end,  and  met  with  Maithili  and  with 
care  explored  the  favourite  region  of  Mahendra,  which  is 
covered  with  woods  and  thickets,  return  satisfied." 


CHAPTER     41 

Sugriva  sends  out  other  Monkeys  to  explore  the  Southern  Region 

Then  having  sent  away  that  mighty  host  of  monkeys  to  the  east, 
Sugriva  dispatched  another  well  tried  army  to  the  south. 

Appointing  Angada  leader  of  those  heroic  monkeys,  that  hero, 
the  lord  of  the  monkey  bands,  conversant  with  the  countries 
that  had  to  be  explored,  sent  out  those  endowed  with  speed  and 
valour :  Nila,  the  Son  of  Agni,  and  the  monkey  Hanuman,  the 
exceedingly  energetic  Jambavan,  Suhotra  and  Sharari, 
Sharagulma,  Gaja,  Gavaksha,  Gavaya,  Sushena,  Vrishabha, 
Mainda,  Dvivida,  Gandhamadana,  Ulkamukha  and  Ananga, 
the  two  sons  of  Hutashana. 

And  the  King  of  the  Monkeys  began  to  describe  those  regions 
that  were  difficult  of  access  to  those  simian  chiefs,  saying : — 

"  You  will  first  behold  the  Vindhya  ranges,  possessing  a 
hundred  peaks  covered  with  trees  and  shrubs  of  every  kind,  and 
the  enchanting  river,  Narmada,  frequented  by  mighty  serpents, 
and  the  wide  and  charming  stream,  Godavari,  with  its  dark 
reeds,  and  the  captivating  Krishnaveni ;  the  regions  of  Mekhalas 
and  Utkala  and  the  city  of  Dasharna  also  ;  Abravanti  and  Avanti, 
276 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

Vidarbhas  and  Nishtikas  and  the  charming  Mahishakas.  You 
will  sec  too,  the  Matsyas,  Kalingas  and  Kaushikas,  where  you 
should  search  for  the  princess  and  the  Dandaka  Forest  with  its 
mountains,  rivers  and  caverns  and  the  Godavari,  also  examine 
the  districts  of  Andhras,  Paundras,  the  Cholas,  Pandyas  and 
Keralas.  Then  repair  to  the  Ayomukha  Mountain,  rich  in  ore, 
with  its  marvellous  peaks  and  flowering  woodlands ;  that 
mountain,  possessing  lovely  forests  of  sandalwood,  should  be 
carefully  searched  by  you. 

"  Thereafter  you  will  behold  that  divine  river  of  pure  waters, 
the  Kaveri,  rendered  gay  by  troups  of  Apsaras.  On  the  summit 
of  the  mighty  Mountain  Malaya,  bright  as  the  sun,  you  will  behold 
Agastya,  the  foremost  of  Rishis.  By  the  permission  of  that  high- 
souled  one,  you  will  cross  over  the  great  river,  Tamraparni, 
abounding  in  crocodiles.  Ravishing  forests  of  sandalwood  cover 
the  islands  of  these  waters  flowing  to  the  sea,  which  resemble  a 
youthful  bride  going  to  meet  her  lover. 

"  Proceeding  further,  O  Monkeys,  you  will  see  the  golden 
gates  set  with  pearls  of  the  city  of  the  Pandyas ;  then  in  order 
to  ensure  the  success  of  your  enterprise,  you  will  approach  the 
sea  and  ascertain  your  ability  for  crossing  it.  In  the  centre  of 
the  ocean,  Agastya  has  set  that  foremost  of  mountains,  Mahendra, 
its  slopes  covered  with  trees.  Entirely  made  of  gold  it  extends 
deep  down  into  the  waters ;  the  abode  of  Gods,  Rishis,  Yakshas 
and  Apsaras,  thronged  by  innumerable  Siddhas  and  Charanas 
and  of  surpassing  loveliness,  it  is  visited  by  the  thousand-eyed 
God  at  each  new  moon. 

"  On  the  other  side  of  the  sea  is  an  island,  four  hundred  miles 
in  length,  inaccessible  to  men  and  splendid  to  look  upon ; 
search  there  with  particular  care,  it  is  the  abode  of  the  wicked 
Ravana,  who  merits  death,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  in  splendour 
equal  to  Indra  himself. 

"  In  the  middle  of  the  ocean  dwells  the  female  titan  named 
Angaraka,  who  procures  her  prey  by  seizing  the  shadow  of 
those  who  fly  in  the  air.  Your  doubts  at  rest,  search  there 
for  the  consort  of  that  king  of  men  whose  glory  is  limitless. 

"  Beyond  that  island  in  the  sea  there  rises  a  lovely  hill  on  which 
Celestial  Beings  dwell,  named  Pushpitaka,  bright  as  the  rays  of 
sun  or  moon,  lapped  by  the  waves  of  the  ocean,  whose  peaks 
277 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

seem  to  pierce  the  heavens.  Of  these,  one  all  golden,  on  which 
the  day's  orb  lingers,  the  ungrateful  and  the  unbeliever  may  not 
behold.  Inclining  your  heads  to  that  peak,  offer  salutations  and 
search  on.  After  this  you  will  come  to  another  mountain, 
difficult  of  access,  named  Suryavan  extending  over  fourteen 
yojanas  and,  beyond  this,  the  mountain  Vaidyuta,  ever  green, 
with  trees  bearing  every  desirable  fruit  in  all  seasons.  Par- 
taking of  these  delectable  fruit  and  roots  and  drinking  the  honey, 
pass  on,  O  Monkeys. 

"  Beyond  there  is  the  Mountain  Kunjara  which  delights  the 
eye  and  heart,  where  Vishwakarma  constructed  the  abode  of 
Agastya.  Extending  over  four  miles,  this  stately  golden 
edifice  adorned  with  many  kinds  of  gems  rises  to  the  height  of 
ten  yojanas.  There  also  is  the  city  of  Bhogavati,  the  abode  of 
the  Serpent  Race,  with  spacious  streets,  incapable  of  being 
captured,  guarded  by  formidable  snakes  and  sharp-toothed 
highly-poisonous  serpents,  where  the  dread  King  of  the  Serpents, 
Vasuki,  dwells.  Search  that  city  with  care  in  every  hidden 
place  wheresoever  it  may  be. 

"  Going  beyond,  you  will  find  the  beautiful  Rishabha  Mountain 
in  the  form  of  a  bull,  filled  with  gems  where  excellent  Goshiraka, 
Padmaka,  and  Harishyama  trees  and  those  possessing  the 
brilliance  of  fire  are  seen.  Approaching  the  sandalwood  forest 
by  no  means  should  you  enter  there,  for  a  certain  Gandharva, 
named  Rohita,  protects  it  with  five  other  Celestial  Beings  re- 
splendent as  the  sun,  named  Shailusha,  Gramani,  Shiksha, 
Shuka  and  Rabhru. 

"  Thereafter  you  will  see  the  retreat  of  those  ascetics,  whose 
splendour  resembles  the  sun,  moon  and  fire ;  this  is  the  end  of 
the  earth  where  those  who  have  won  the  heavenly  regions,  dwell. 
Beyond  is  the  dread  abode  of  the  Pitris,  which  is  inaccessible. 
There  Death  has  his  city,  enveloped  in  abysmal  gloom,  O 
Bulls  among  Monkeys.  Pursue  your  explorations  thus  far;  but 
those  who  go  beyond  never  return. 

"  Having  searched  all  those  regions  which  are  accessible  to  you, 
seeking  for  some  trace  of  the  princess,  he  who  shall  return 
within  a  month  saying  *  I  have  seen  Sita  '  will  pass  his  days  in 
happiness,  enjoying  prosperity  equal  to  mine,  in  the  midst  of 
every  delight.  None  will  be  dearer  to  me ;  I  shall  cherish  him 
278 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

as  a  relative  and,  however  great  the  number  of  his  faults,  he  will 
become  my  friend. 

"  Your  strength  and  vigour  are  immeasurable  and  you  are 
born  in  families  endowed  with  great  qualities ;  strive  manfully 
therefore  to  find  the  princess ;  set  forth  on  this  mission  of 
supreme  importance  and  demonstrate  your  heroism."

Other  Monkeys  are  sent  to  explore  the  Western  Region 

Having  despatched  those  monkeys  in  a  southerly  direction, 
Sugriva,  addressing  the  leader,  Sushena,  who  resembled  a  cloud, 
with  bent  head  and  joined  palms  approached  his  father-in-law, 
Tara's  sire,  who  was  endowed  with  great  prowess,  and  spoke 
to  him  also.  Then  he  issued  orders  to  Maricha,  the  son  of 
Maharshi  and  the  mighty  ape,  Archismat,  surrounded  by  the 
foremost  of  monkeys,  possessing  the  splendour  of  Mahendra 
and  like  unto  Vainateya  in  brilliance,  and  also  to  Marietta's 
offspring,  the  Marichas,  the  mighty  Archirmalayas,  that  all 
these  sons  of  the  ascetic1  should  march  towards  the  region 
of  the  West,  saying : — 

"  O  Ye  Monkey  Chiefs,  let  two  hundred  thousand  monkeys, 
led  by  Sushena,  set  out  in  search  of  Vaidehi !  Scour  the 
countries  of  the  Saurashtras,  the  Bahlikas  and  Chandrachitras 
abounding  in  antimony  and  other  provinces  and  populous 
places  and  fair  and  pleasant  cities  and  Kukshi,  dense  with  Punnaga 
trees  and  filled  with  Bakula  and  Uddalaka  trees,  as  well  as  the 
tracts  covered  with  Ketakas  and  the  auspicious  streams  whose 
cool  waters  flow  towards  the  west. 

"  Explore  the  forest  of  the  ascetics  and  the  mountain  wood- 
lands ;  there,  having  searched  the  tracts  resembling  deserts,  the 
towering  cliffs  and  the  mountain  ranges,  extremely  difficult  of 
access,  proceed  further,  when  you  will  behold  the  sea,  which 
abounds  in  whales  and  crocodiles,  O  Monkeys.

'*  Then  the  apes  shall  disport  themselves  amidst  the  groves 
covered  with  Ketakas  and  dense  with  Tamala  and  coconut  trees. 
Look  for  Sita  and  Ravana's  stronghold  there,  in  hills  and  woods, 
on  the  shores  of  the  sea  and  explore  Murachipattana  and  the 
delightful  cities  of  Jafapura,  Avanti  and  Angalapa  as  also  the 
forest  of  Alakshita  and  all  these  spacious  kingdoms. 

"  There,  where  the  river  Sindhu  joins  the  ocean,  is  a  high 
mountain  named  Somagiri,  possessing  a  hundred  peaks  and 
covered  with  tall  trees.  On  its  slopes  dwell  the  Sinhas1  who 
carry  whales  and  elephants  to  their  nests.  These  are  found  on 
the  mountain  ridges  and  on  the  extensive  plateaus,  where  wild 
elephants  range,  gratified  with  food,  whose  trumpeting  re- 
sembles the  roar  of  thunder.  The  monkeys,  able  to  change  their 
shape  at  will,  should  scour  that  golden  summit,  towering  to  the 
sky  and  covered  with  graceful  trees. 

"  In  the  middle  of  the  sea  rises  the  golden  summit  of  the 
Mountain  Pariyatra,  extending  over  a  hundred  yojanas.  There 
dwell  thousands  of  powerful  Gandharvas,  effulgent  as  fire, 
formidable  and  mischievous,  resembling  flames.  O  Valiant 
Monkeys,  do  not  approach  them  nor  seek  to  eat  the  fruits  from 
that  region.  These  fruit  trees  are  guarded  with  ferocious 
vigilance  by  those  mighty  Gandharvas,  nevertheless  you  should 
search  for  Janaki  there,  nor  have  you  ought  to  fear  if  you  pre- 
serve your  monkey  form. 

"  There  is  a  mighty  hill,  the  colour  of  emerald,  shining  like  a 
diamond,  named  Vajra,  covered  with  trees  and  creepers,  an 
hundred  yojanas  in  height  and  area ;  carefully  search  all  the 
caves  of  that  mountain. 

"  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  ocean  is  the  Mt.  Charavat ; 
there  Vishwakarma  forged  the  discus  Sahasrara,  which  together 
with  the  conch  was  taken  possession  of  by  Shri  Vishnu  when  he 
had  slain  Panchajana  and  the  Danava  Hayagriva.  In  those 
deep  caverns  and  amidst  those  charming  slopes,  search  for 
Ravana  and  Videha's  daughter  with  care. 

"  Beyond,  rising  from  the  depths  of  the  sea,  is  the  mighty 
mountain,  Varaha  with  its  peak  of  pure  gold  which  measures 
four  and  sixty  yojanas.  On  it  is  the  golden  city  named 
Pragjyotisha  where  the  giant,  Naraka,  dwells.    There  do  you 

1  Lit.  "  Flying  lions,"  possibly  eagles  or  prehistoric  birds. 
280 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

search  for  Ravana  and  Vaidehi  among  the  beautiful  plateaus 
and  huge  caves. 

*'  Passing  beyond  that  foremost  of  mountains,  revealing 
glimpses  of  the  gold  in  its  depths,  you  will  come  to  the  Mountain 
Sarvasauvarna  with  its  many  fountains  and  waterfalls ;  there 
elephants,  wild  boar,  lions  and  tigers  roar  ceaselessly  on  every 
side,  filling  it  with  their  clamour  day  and  night.  Then  there  is 
the  mountain  named  Megha  where  the  Gods  crowned  the 
fortunate  Mahendra,  he  of  the  bay  horses,  the  Vanquisher  of 
Paka.  Having  passed  that  mountain  protected  by  Mahendra, 
you  should  repair  to  a  range  of  sixty  thousand  golden  hills,  bright 
as  the  rising  sun,  casting  their  light  on  every  side  and  embellished 
with  blossoming  golden  trees.  In  their  midst  rises  the  monarch 
of  mountains,  Meru,  the  foremost  of  hills,  on  whom  Aditya,  well 
pleased,  conferred  a  boon  saying  : — 

"  '  By  my  grace  all  the  mountains  under  thy  protection  shall 
be  golden  by  night  and  day  and  those  Gods  who  inhabit  thee, 
the  Gandharvas  and  Danavas,  shall  both  assume  the  radiance  of 
gold.' 

"  At  dusk,  the  Vishwadevas,  the  Vasus,  the  Maruts  and  the 
Celestials  gather  to  adore  the  Sun-god  and  worshipped  by  them 
the  sun  sinks  below  the  horizon  traversing  forty  thousand  miles 
in  the  space  of  an  hour,  when  it  withdraws  behind  the  mountain 
range.  On  the  summit  of  that  mountain  rises  a  palace  resembling 
the  sun  in  splendour,  consisting  of  countless  towers,  which  was 
built  by  Vishwakarma  and  is  graced  by  various  trees  filled  with 
birds.  It  is  the  abode  of  the  magnanimous  Varuna,  who  bears 
the  noose  in  his  hand. 

"  Between  the  Meru  mountain  and  the  Astachala  Range  there 
is  a  great  Tala  tree  with  ten  crests,  made  of  pure  gold,  which 
shines  with  extreme  brilliance  on  a  marvellous  base.  Search  all 
the  inaccessible  places  on  this  mountain,  as  well  as  the  lakes  and 
rivers  for  Ravana  and  Vaidehi. 

"  It  is  there  that  the  virtuous  Merusavarni  dwells,  sanctified 
by  his  asceticism  and  equal  to  Brahma  himself.  Bowing  down, 
you  should  make  enquiries  of  the  Maharishi  Merusavarni,|who 
resembles  the  sun,  concerning  Mithila's  daughter. 

"  From  the  end  of  the  night,  all  those  regions,  that  the  sun 
illumines  till  it  sets  behind  the  Astachala  mountains,  should  be 
281 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

searched  by  you,  O  Bulls  among  the  Monkeys,  but  of  that  which 
lies  beyond  which  is  covered  in  darkness  and  without  bourne, 
we  know  nought ! 

"  Search  for  Sita  and  Ravana  in  this  region  as  far  as  the 
Astachala  Mountain  and  at  the  end  of  a  month,  return ;  those 
who  tarry  beyond  this  term  will  die.  My  father-in-law  of  long 
arms  gifted  with  great  prowess,  I  appoint  as  your  leader ;  you 
should  abide  by  his  commands  and  listen  to  all  he  says ;  he  is 
my  spiritual  preceptor.  All  of  you  are  valorous  and  well  able 
to  ascertain  the  wisdom  of  a  course,  still  you  will  be  doing  your 
duty  in  accepting  him  as  your  leader.  In  this  wise,  explore  the 
western  quarter.  Having  requited  the  good  that  has  been  done 
to  us,  we  shall  attain  our  end.  Do  you  also  determine  what  is 
pleasing  to  Rama  and,  in  accord  with  time  and  place,  execute  it." 

Then  those  monkeys  and  their  leaders  with  Sushena  at  their 
head,  having  given  a  due  hearing  to  the  wise  counsel  delivered 
by  Sugriva,  offered  salutations  to  him  and  set  out  for  the  quarter 
protected  by  Varuna. 


chapter    43 

Searchers  are  sent  to  the  Northern  Region 

Having  directed  his  father-in-law  to  the  western  region,  the 
Lord  of  the  Apes  spoke  to  that  heroic  monkey  Shatavali,  in 
words  fraught  with  his  own  and  Rama's  interests  : — "  With  an 
escort  of  a  hundred  thousand  rangers  of  the  woods,  the  sons  of 
Vaivasvat  and  thy  counsellors,  do  thou  explore  the  northern 
region,  O  Hero,  which  is  crowned  with  the  snowy  peaks  of 
Himalaya,  and  search  everywhere  for  Rama's  illustrious  consort 
there. 

"  O  Most  Grcumspect  of  Beings,  having  executed  this  task 
and  done  that  which  is  pleasing  to  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  we  shall 
have  honoured  our  obligation  and  achieved  success.  The 
magnanimous  Raghava  has  rendered  us  a  great  service  and,  if 
we  can  make  some  return,  our  life  will  not  have  been  lived  in 
vain.  To  render  assistance  to  any  in  need  is  to  make  one's  life 
282 


KISHKINDHA    KAN",DA 

fruitful,  even  if  one  is  under  no  obligation  to  do  so ;  how  much 
more  if  one  is  able  to  repay  one's  benefactor.  Reflecting  on  this, 
those  who  value  our  well-being  and  happiness  should  do  all  in 
their  power  to  discover  Janaki. 

"  Rama,  the  foremost  of  men,  revered  by  all  beings,  the 
conqueror  of  hostile  citadels,  is  united  with  us  in  friendship. 
Endowed  with  courage  and  discrimination,  do  you  explore  these 
numerous  and  dangerous  regions,  rivers  and  mountains. 

"  Search  the  lands  of  the  Mlecchas,  Pulindas,  Shurasenas, 
Prasthalas,  Bharatas,  Kurus,  Madrakas,  Kambojas  and  Yavanas. 
The  cities  of  Shakas  should  be  visited  by  you  as  well  as  the 
Varadas,  thereafter  do  you  explore  Himavat.  In  the  tracts  of 
Lodhras  and  Padmakas  and  in  the  Devadaru  woods,  search  on 
every  side  for  Ravana  and  Vaidehi.  Reaching  the  Soma 
hermitage,  frequented  by  Devas  and  Gandharvas,  proceed  to 
the  mountain  named  Kala,  possessing  spacious  plateaus.  In 
the  midst  of  these  mountainous  tracts,  in  the  valleys  and  caverns 
search  for  that  illustrious  lady,  Rama's  irreproachable  consort. 
Having  traversed  that  golden  breasted  mountain,  you  should 
scale  Mt.  Sudarshana  and  further  Mt.  Devasakha,  the  refuge 
of  birds,  filled  with  every  variety  of  winged  creature  and 
covered  with  trees  of  differing  fragrance.  Amidst  its  golden 
rocks,  fountains  and  caves,  search  for  Ravana  and  Videha's 
daughter. 

Going  beyond  this  mountain,  you  will  come  upon  an  open 
space,  measuring  four  hundred  miles  in  extent,  devoid  of 
mountains,  rivers  and  trees,  nor  are  any  living  beings  to  be 
found  there.  Speedily  traversing  this  desert  you  will  reach 
the  stainless  Kailasha  Mountain  which  will  fill  you  with  delight. 
There,  resembling  a  pale  cloud,  you  will  see  the  charming 
domain  of  Kuvera,  of  burnished  gold,  constructed  by  Vish- 
wakarma,  where  lies  a  great  lake  covered  with  flowering  lotuses 
and  lilies,  frequented  by  swans  and  ducks,  where  troops  of 
Apsaras  disport  themselves.  There  the  King  Vaishravana, 
adored  by  the  whole  world,  the  gracious  dispenser  of  riches, 
sports  with  the  Guhyakas1.  Amidst  these  mountains,  bright  as 
the  moon,  as  also  in  the  caverns,  search  carefully  for  Ravana 
and  Sita. 

*  Hidden  Beings  attendants  on  Kuvera. 

283 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMI4CI 

Coming  to  Mt.  Krauncha,  with  exceeding  circumspection, 
enter  its  inaccessible  caverns,  which  are  well  known  to  be  ex- 
tremely hard  to  penetrate.  There  dwell  certain  great  and 
illustrious  Rishis,  effulgent  as  the  sun,  adored  by  the  Gods, 
whose  forms  they  assume.  You  should  explore  the  other  caves, 
plateaus  and  peaks  of  the  Krauncha  Mountain  thoroughly.  Then 
the  tree-less  Manasa  peak  will  be  seen,  the  abode  of  birds,  and 
the  scene  of  Kama's  austerities,  where  no  way  for  any  creature, 
God  or  Titan  exists ;  this  mountain  should  also  be  searched  by 
you.  Beyond  this  is  the  Mainaka  Mountain  where  the  great 
giant  Maya  has  built  his  abode ;  this  place  with  its  plateaus, 
plains  and  woods  must  also  be  searched  by  you.  Women  with 
the  faces  of  horses  dwell  there. 

"  Going  beyond  there,  you  will  reach  the  abode  of  the  Siddhas, 
where  the  ascetics — Valakhilyas  and  Vaikhanasas  are.  Fay 
obeisance  to  those  great  beings,  whose  austerities  have  cleansed 
them  from  all  sin  and,  in  humility,  enquire  of  them  concerning 
Sita.  There  is  the  Vaikhanasa  lake  covered  with  golden 
lotuses,  the  resort  of  beautiful  swans,  bright  as  the  dawn.  The 
elephant  of  Kuvera,  Sarvabhauma  by  name,  in  the  company  of 
she-elephants,  wanders  about  in  that  region. 

"  Beyond  that  lake  is  a  sky  bereft  of  moon,  sun,  stars  and 
clouds  but  it  is  illumined  as  if  by  so  many  solar  rays,  through  the 
effulgence  of  god-like  Sages  crowned  by  asceticism,  who  rest 
there.  Leaving  that  region  behind,  you  come  to  the  river 
Shailoda,  on  whose  banks  the  Kichaka  reeds  grow,  by  the  help 
of  which  the  Siddhas  cross  to  and  fro.  There  are  the  Uttara 
Kurus,  with  whom  those  who  have  acquired  spiritual  merit  take 
refuge.  There  are  lakes  there,  whose  waters  are  covered  with 
golden  lotuses  and  innumerable  rivers  abounding  in  dark  green 
leaves  and  pools  of  the  hue  of  the  rising  sun,  embellished  by 
clumps  of  crimson  lotuses.  Pearls  and  gems  of  great  price  and 
masses  of  blue  flowers  possessing  golden  stamens  cover  those 
tracts  and  rivers  with  floating  islets,  where  gold  abounds  and 
high  banks  scattered  with  precious  stones,  are  seen.  The  trees 
there,  thronged  with  birds,  bear  fruit  and  flowers  at  all  seasons, 
charged  with  delectable  juices  and  distilling  delicious  perfumes, 
fulfilling  every  desire.  Other  excellent  trees  give  rich  attire  of 
different  kinds  and  ornaments  of  pearls,  emeralds  and  other 
284 


KISHKINDHA    RANDA 

gems  desired  by  men  and  women ;  some  also  bear  fruit  which 
can  be  partaken  of  in  every  season.  Some  trees  bring  forth 
precious  couches  bedecked  with  costly  and  variegated  coverlets 
and  others  furnish  enchanting  garlands,  costly  drinks  and  various 
kinds  of  viands.  Women  possessed  of  every  accomplishment 
distinguished  for  their  youth  and  beauty,  are  there,  sporting  with 
Gandharvas,  Kinneras,  Siddhas,  Nagas,  and  Vidyadharas  of 
great  splendour;  and  all  those  of  righteous  deeds  engaged  in 
pleasure  and  those  who  enjoy  what  is  pleasant  and  useful, 
sojourn  there  with  their  wives. 

"  There  the  continual  sound  of  musical  instruments,  blended 
with  sweet  laughter,  is  heard,  giving  delight  to  all  beings  :  there 
is  none  there  who  is  not  happy  or  wants  for  any  desirable 
object  and  every  day  the  enchantment  of  that  place  increases. 

"  Beyond  that  region  is  the  Northern  Sea.  There  in 
the  bosom  of  the  deep  rises  the  Somagiri  Mountain  of  immense 
size.  Though  bereft  of  the  sun,  yet  on  account  of  the  brilliance 
of  the  Soma  mountain,  that  land  is  as  bright  as  if  Vivasvat 
himself  had  warmed  it  with  his  luminous  rays.  There  dwells 
the  Soul  of  the  universe,  Shambhuinin,  in  his  cosmic  form  as  the 
eleven  Rudras  surrounded  by  Brahmarishis. 

"  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  you  should  not  venture  beyond 
the  region  of  the  Uttara  Kurus,  nor  is  there  any  way  for  creatures 
to  do  so.  That  mountain,  named  Soma,  is  incapable  of  being 
scaled,  even  by  the  Gods.  Sighting  this  mountain,  turn  back 
speedily.  You  may  proceed  so  far,  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys, 
but  the  region  beyond,  where  unending  night  broods,  is  unknown 
to  us. 

"  You  should  search  all  those  places,  which  I  have  described 
to  you,  and  also  those  I  have  omitted  to  mention.  O  You  who 
are  equal  to  the  wind  and  fire,  by  discovering  the  place  of  con-

exceedingly  pleasing  to  the  son  of  Dasaratha  as  well  as  to  me ! 
Having  achieved  your  purpose,  do  you  with  your  relatives, 
honoured  by  me  and  having  acquired  every  distinction,  your

Monkeys."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    44 

Rama  gives  his  Ring  to  Hanuman 

Sugriva  disclosed  his  plan  to  Hanuman  in  particular,  being 
supremely  confident  that  this  leader,  the  foremost  of  monkeys, 
would  accomplish  his  purpose. 

Then  the  monkey  king,  the  lord  of  all  the  dwellers  in  the 
woods,  well  pleased,  addressed  the  son  of  the  Wind-God,  the 
peerless  Hanuman,  saying  : — "  Nowhere  on  the  earth,  in  the  air 
or  sky,  in  the  celestial  regions  or  in  the  depths  of  the  sea,  do  I 
know  of  any  obstacle  that  can  impede  thy  course,  O  Best  of 
Monkeys !  All  the  worlds  with  the  Asuras,  Gandharvas, 
Nagas,  Men  and  Gods,  as  well  as  the  mountains  and  the  seas  are 
well  known  to  thee.  In  motion,  speed,  skill  and  energy  thou  art 
the  equal  of  thy  sire,  O  Valiant  One,  and  there  exists  no  creature 
on  this  earth  that  is  like  thee  in  vigour,  O  Hero  of  infinite 
resource !  Reflect  therefore  on  how  Sita  may  be  found  !  In 
thee,  O  Hanuman,  repose  strength,  wit,  courage  and  policy 
in  conjunction  with  the  knowledge  of  time  and  place." 

Realizing  that  success  in  the  venture  depended  on  Hanuman 
and  that  Hanuman  himself  was  chosen  on  account  of  his  ex- 
ploits, Rama  reflected :  "  This  Lord  of  the  Monkeys  has 
supreme  confidence  in  Hanuman  and  Hanuman  too  is  sure  of 
success ;  he  who  has  been  tested  by  his  deeds  and  who  is  con- 
sidered worthiest  by  his  master  is  certain  to  accomplish  his 
purpose." 

Thereupon  that  mighty  warrior,  Rama,  considering  that  his 
ends  were  already  gained,  felt  a  great  felicity  flooding  his  mind 
and  heart  and  that  scourge  of  his  enemies,  highly  gratified,  gave 
Hanuman  a  ring  inscribed  with  his  name  that  would  be  a  sign 
to  the  princess  and  said  to  him : — 

"  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  by  this  token,  the  daughter  of 
Janaka  will  not  fail  to  recognize  thee  as  my  messenger.    O 
Warrior,  thy  resolution,  thy  courage  and  thine  experience  as  also 
Sugriva's  words  seem  to  me  to  predict  success." 
286 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

Thereupon,  taking  the  ring  and  placing  it  to  his  forehead,  that 
foremost  of  monkeys,  offering  obeisance  to  the  feet  of  Rama, 
prepared  to  depart.  Taking  with  him  a  mighty  band  of  monkeys, 
that  hero,  the  son  of  Pavana,  resembling  the  moon  in  a  cloudless 
sky  encircled  by  stars,  set  forth. 

And  Rama  addressed  that  mighty  warrior  saying : — "  O  Thou 
endowed  with  the  strength  of  a  lion,  I  depend  on  thy  valour ; 
by  summoning  up  thy  great  resources,  do  all  in  thy  power, 
O  Son  of  the  Wind,  O  Hanuman,  to  bring  back  the  daughter  of 
Janaka." 


chapter    45 

The  Departure  of  the  Monkeys 

Summoning  all  the  monkeys,  the  Lord  of  the  Apes,  Sugriva, 
spoke  to  them  touching  the  success  of  Rama's  enterprise,  and 
said: — 

"  O  Chiefs  of  the  Monkeys,  knowing  my  commands,  go  forth 
and  search  those  regions  indicated  by  me."  Whereupon, 
covering  the  earth  like  locusts,  the  army  started  out.  During 
the  month  fixed  for  the  search  for  Sita,  Rama  and  Lakshmana 
remained  on  the  mountain  Frasravana. 

The  valiant  Shatavali  set  out  with  all  speed  for  the  north,  that 
marvellous  region  where  the  monarch  of  the  mountain  rises1 
whilst  the  leader  of  the  monkey  bands,  Vinata,  went  towards  the 
east.  Tara,2  Angada  and  others,  in  company  with  that  monkey 
born  of  Pavana,  marched  towards  the  southern  region  inhabited 
by  Agastya ;  and  Sushena,  that  lion  among  monkeys,  went  to  the 
west,  that  fearful  region  protected  by  Varuna. 

Having  despatched  the  generals  of  his  forces  to  each  of  the 
quarters,  that  king  of  the  monkey  hosts  experienced  supreme 
satisfaction. 

Under  the  orders  of  their  sovereign,  all  the  monkey  leaders 
departed  in  great  haste,  each  in  the  direction  assigned  to  him 
and,  full  of  valour,  those  monkeys  shouted,  cheered,  howled  and 


287 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

chattered,  rushing  on  and  on  amidst  a  great  uproar.  Having 
listened  to  the  instructions  of  their  monarch,  the  leaders  of  these 
monkeys  cried :  "  We  shall  bring  Sita  back  and  slay  Havana  ". 
Some  said  :  "  I  alone  shall  defeat  Ravana  in  open  combat  and 
having  laid  him  low,  shall  deliver  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  still 
trembling  with  fear,  saying  to  her  *  Rest  here,  thou  art  weary  '." 
Others  said:  "  Singlehanded  I  shall  recover  Janaki  even  if  it  be 
from  the  depth  of  hell ;  I  shall  uproot  the  trees,  cleave  the 
mountains,  penetrate  the  earth  and  churn  up  the  ocean."  One 
said,  "  Without  doubt  I  can  clear  four  miles  in  one  bound !  " 
and  another,  "  I  can  clear  a  hundred,"  and  yet  another,  "1  am 
able  to  leap  more  than  a  hundred.  Neither  on  earth,  in  the 
sky  nor  on  the  sea  nor  mountains  nor  in  forests,  not  even  in  the 
nether  regions  can  anything  bar  my  progress  ". 

Thus  in  turn  did  the  monkeys,  proud  of  their  strength,  speak 
in  the  presence  of  their  king. 


CHAPTER     46 

Sugriva  narrates  Ms  Travels  through  the  World 

The  leaders  of  the  monkeys  having  departed,  Rama  enquired  of 
Sugriva  saying  : — "  How  is  it  that  thou  knowest  all  the  quarters 
of  the  earth  ?  " 

Then  Sugriva,  bowing  low,  said  to  Rama :  "  Hear  me  and  I 
will  tell  thee  all. 

"  When  Bali  pursued  the  giant  Dundubhi,  in  the  form  of  a 
buffalo,  in  the  direction  of  the  Malaya  mountain,  Mahisha1 
entered  a  cave  in  that  mountain  and  Bali,  desirous  of  slaying  that 
Asura,  followed  him. 

"  I  remained  obediently  at  the  entrance  of  the  cave,  but  a 
whole  year  passed  and  Bali  did  not  re-emerge.  Then  the  cavern 
was  filled  with  foaming  blood  which  gushed  forth,  and  seeing 
this,  1  was  terrified  and  consumed  with  a  burning  grief  on 
account  of  my  brother.    Distracted,  I  reflected :    *  My  elder 

1  Another  name  of  Dundubhi,  meaning  "  great  or  powerful  animal," 
a  buffalo. 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

brother  is  certainly  dead '  and  I  placed  a  rock,  as  large  as  a  hill, 
at  the  mouth  of  the  cave,  thinking  '  The  buffalo  will  not  be  able 
to  come  out  and  will  die* ;  after  which  I  returned  to  Kishkindha 
giving  up  all  hope  of  Bali  being  alive. 

"  There  obtaining  the  mighty  kingdom  with  Tara  and  Ruma, 
surrounded  by  my  friends,  I  began  to  pass  my  days  in  peace. 

"  That  bull  among  monkeys,  however,  having  slain  Dundubhi 
returned,  and  trembling  with  fear,  in  all  humility,  I  made  over 
the  crown  to  him. 

"  That  wicked  wretch,  however,  beside  himself  with  rage, 
wishing  to  slay  me,  followed  me  whilst  I  sought  to  fly  with  my 
ministers.  It  was  then  that,  hotly  pursued  by  him,  I  passed 
by  various  streams,  forests  and  cities.  The  earth  appeared 
to  me  like  the  reflection  of  a  whirling  firebrand  seen  in  a  mirror 
or  a  puddle.1 

"  Journeying  towards  the  eastern  region,  I  beheld  many  kinds 
of  trees,  beautiful  mountains,  charming  caverns  and  lakes.  I 
saw  the  Udaya  Mountain  rich  in  gold  and  the  white  sea,  the 
abode  of  Apsaras.  Pursued  by  Bali,  flying  on  and  on,  O  Lord, 
I  turned  and  continued  my  course  then,  changing  my  direction 
once  more,  I  made  for  the  south,  covered  by  the  Vindhya 
Forest  and  embellished  with  sandal  wood  trees.  Thereafter, 
seeing  Bali  among  the  woods,  on  the  mountains,  I  went  west- 
wards still  followed  by  him. 

"It  is  thus  that  I  grew  conversant  with  every  kind  of  region 
and  finally  reached  the  Astachala  Mountains.  Beyond  that 
most  beautiful  and  elevated  of  ranges  I  turned  to  the  north 
and  passed  Himavat,  Meru  and  the  Northern  Sea. 

"  Unable  to  find  refuge  from  Bali,  the  sagacious  Hanuman 
said  to  me :— *  O  King,  I  recollect  now  that  the  Lord  of  the 
Monkeys  was  formerly  cursed  by  the  Sage  Matanga  in  this  very 
hermitage.  If  he  should  enter  this  asylum,  his  head  will  be 
split  into  a  hundred  pieces ;  we  can,  therefore,  take  up  our  abode 
here  without  anxiety.' 

"  O  Son  of  a  King,  I,  thereupon,  went  to  the  Rishyamuka 
Mountain,  nor  did  Bali  dare  to  come  there  for  fear  of  the  Sage 
Matanga.  This  is  how,  O  King,  I  visited  every  part  of  the  world 
and  took  refuge  in  this  cave."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     47 

The  Return  of  the  Monkeys 

In  order  to  find  Vaidehi,  those  leaders  of  monkeys,  in  obedience 
to  their  sovereign's  will,  speedily  went  forth  in  all  directions  to 
their  destinations,  and  they  explored  lakes,  streams,  plains, 
cities  and  tracts  rendered  impassible  by  torrents.  Then  those 
chiefs  of  the  monkey  bands  searched  the  regions  described  by 
Sugriva  with  their  mountains,  woods  and  forests.  Engaged 
during  the  day  in  seeking  for  Sita,  when  night  fell,  they  stretched 
themselves  on  the  ground,  and  coming  to  trees  covered  with 
fruits  in  all  seasons,  they  slept  there. 

Counting  the  day  of  their  departure  as  the  first,  at  the  end  of  a 
month,  giving  up  hope,  they  returned  to  their  king  on  the 
Prasravana  mountain. 

Having  scoured  the  eastern  region  with  his  forces,  the  mighty 
Vinata  returned  without  having  seen  Sita.  Thereafter  the  great 
monkey  Shatabali  came  back  disappointed  with  his  forces, 
having  scoured  the  whole  of  the  northern  quarter.  And 
Sushena,  at  the  end  of  the  month,  ranging  the  western  region 
without  success,  presented  himself  in  company  with  his  monkeys 
before  Sugriva. 

Coming  before  Sugriva  who  was  seated  with  Rama  on  a  ridge 
of  the  Prasravana  Mountain,  and  paying  obeisance  to  them, 
Sushena  said :  "  We  have  searched  all  the  mountains,  deep 
woods,  valleys,  ravines  and  the  countries  situated  on  the  shores 
of  the  sea.  All  the  places  described  by  thee  have  been  scoured 
by  us,  as  also  all  the  jungles  intertwined  by  creepers  abounding 
in  thickets  that  are  impassable  and  the  hilly  districts.  Huge 
animals  have  been  encountered  by  us,  which  we  have  slain,  and 
we  have  searched  these  densely  wooded  regions  again  and  again, 
O  Lord  of  the  Monkeys.  It  is  Hanuman,  who  is  mighty  and 
nobly  born,  who  will  discover  Maithili ;  the  son  of  the  Wind  has 
undoubtedly  gone  to  where  Sita  has  been  taken."

CHAPTER     48 

Angada  slays  an  Asura 

The  monkey  Hanuman,  accompanied  by  Tara1  and  Angada, 
swiftly  set  out  to  the  quarter  assigned  to  him  by  Sugriva.  With 
all  those  leaders  of  monkeys,  he  travelled  a  great  distance  and 
explored  the  woods  and  caves  of  the  Vindhya  Mountains. 
Rugged  crags,  impassable  rivers,  lakes,  vast  jungles,  groves, 
innumerable  hills  covered  with  forests  were  searched  by  the 
monkeys  on  every  side,  without  their  being  able  to  find  Maithili, 
the  daughter  of  Janaka,  anywhere. 

Subsisting  on  various  roots  and  fruits,  they  were  overcome  by 
fatigue  in  that  uninhabited  and  waterless  region  amidst  the 
fearful  ravines  and  solitary  places.  Having  searched  that 
immense  area  extremely  hard  of  access,  with  its  mighty  forests, 
containing  caves,  all  those  foremost  of  monkeys  fearlessly 
penetrated  into  another  equally  inhospitable  region,  where  the 
trees  yielded  neither  fruit,  flowers  nor  foliage  and  where  the 
streams  were  dried  up  and  even  roots  were  rare.  There,  neither 
buffaloe  nor  deer,  nor  elephants,  tigers,  birds  nor  any  other 
animals,  that  are  found  in  the  forest,  could  be  seen.  There  were 
neither  trees,  grass,  plants  nor  herbs,  and  in  that  place  there  were 
no  pleasant  pools  with  flowering  or  fragrant  lotuses  and  no 
bees  to  be  observed. 

There  dwelt  the  fortunate  Sage,  Kandu,  a  treasury  of  ascetic- 
ism, of  truthful  speech,  whose  austerities  had  rendered  him  in- 
vincible and  who  was  irascible,  having  lost  his  young  son  at  the 
age  of  ten  years  in  the  forest.  Filled  with  wrath  on  account  of 
his  death,  that  great-souled  One  had  laid  a  curse  on  the  entire 
vast  forest,  rendering  it  unfit  to  harbour  any  creature.  This  in- 
accessible region,  deserted  by  beasts  and  birds,  the  hidden 
recesses  of  the  woods,  the  mountain  caves  and  the  bends  of  the 
rivers  were  carefully  searched  by  the  monkeys  in  order  to  carry 
out  Sugriva's  desire,  but  they  were  unable  to  find  the  daughter 
of  Janaka  or  her  abductor,  Ravana,  there.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Having  entered  a  wood,  overgrown  with  creepers  and  briars, 
they  beheld  a  terrible  titan,  of  dreadful  deeds,  cherishing  no  fear, 
even  for  the  Gods.  Seeing  that  formidable  titan,  who  stood 
erect  like  a  great  hill,  the  monkeys  pressed  close  to  each  other 
girding  up  their  loins. 

Then  that  mighty  Asura  said  to  them  "  You  are  lost !  "  and, 
clenching  his  fists,  rushed  upon  them  in  fury,  but  Angada,  the 
Son  of  Bali,  thinking  it  was  Ravana,  struck  him  with  the  palm 
of  his  hand  with  such  force,  that  he  fell  to  the  earth  like  a  great 
hill,  vomiting  blood.  When  he  had  ceased  to  breathe,  the 
triumphant  monkeys  searched  that  mountain  cavern;  and 
having  satisfied  themselves  that  it  had  been  thoroughly  explored, 
those  dwellers  of  the  woods  entered  into  another  fearful  cave. 
After  having  searched  that  place  also,  they  emerged  exhausted 
and  wholly  dispirited  sat  down  at  the  foot  of  a  solitary  tree. 


chapter    49 

The  Monkeys  search  the  Southern  Region  in  vain 

Then  the  eminently  wise  Angada  addressed  all  the  monkeys  and, 
though  himself  fatigued,  exhorted  them  to  take  courage,  saying : 
"  We  have  searched  the  forests,  mountains,  rivers  and  im- 
penetrable wilds,  valleys  and  caverns  with  care,  without  finding 
the  daughter  of  Janaka,  Sita,  or  that  wicked  wretch,  the  titan, 
who  bore  her  away.  A  great  part  of  the  time  assigned  to  us 
by  Sugriva,  whose  commands  are  inexorable,  has  elapsed  ; 
therefore,  banishing  languor,  despondency,  torpor  and 
fatigue,  together  let  us  examine  every  region  once  again.  Search 
in  such  a  way  that  Sita  may  be  discovered  by  us.  Perseverance, 
ability  and  ardour  are  said  to  conduce  to  success ;  I  therefore 
address  you  thus  : — O  Dwellers  in  the  Woods,  explore  the  whole 
inaccessible  forest  to-day  without  counting  the  cost,  success  will 
wholly  depend  on  your  exertions ;  to  permit  yourselves  to  be 
overcome  by  fatigue  or  give  way  to  sleep  is  not  fitting.  Sugriva 
is  irascible  and  inflicts  harsh  punishments ;  he  is  ever  to  be 
feared,  as  also  the  magnanimous  Rama.  I  speak  in  your  own 
292 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

interests  ;  therefore,  if  you  concur,  act  accordingly  or  let  someone 
point  out  what  alternative  will  benefit  us  all,  O  Monkeys." 

Hearing  Angada's  words,  Gandhamadana,  though  faint  from 
thirst  and  fatigue,  spoke  in  clear  accents,  saying : — "  That  which 
Angada  has  said  is  worthy  of  him  and  is  appropriate  and  timely, 
let  us  act  upon  it !  Let  us  search  the  hills,  caves,  rocks,  desert 
places  and  waterfalls,  in  accord  with  the  instructions  given  by 
Sugriva;  let  us  scour  the  forest  and  the  mountain  ridges 
together  ! " 

Then  the  monkeys,  rising,  full  of  valour,  began  to  range  the 
south  covered  by  the  Vindhya  forests,  afresh.  Scaling  the 
mountain  that  resembled  an  autumnal  cloud,  rich  in  silver,  with 
its  innumerable  peaks  and  valleys,  those  foremost  of  monkeys, 
eager  to  find  Sita,  ranged  the  enchanting  Lodhra  forests  and  die 
woods  of  Saptaparna  trees.  Ascending  to  the  summit  of  the 
mountain,  though  endued  with  immense  energy,  they  were 
overcome  with  fatigue,  yet  they  did  not  see  Vaidehi,  the  beloved 
consort  of  Rama,  anywhere.  Having  surveyed  that  hill  with  its 
innumerable  ravines,  as  far  as  eye  could  see,  the  monkeys  looking 
on  every  side,  descended  and,  reaching  the  base,  harassed  and 
beside  themselves,  halted  for  an  instant  under  a  tree;  then 
finding  themselves  less  fatigued,  they  prepared  to  explore 
the  southern  region  again. 

Thereafter  the  chiefs  of  the  monkeys,  with  Hanuman  at  their 
head,  began  to  range  the  Vindhya  hills  once  more. 


CHAPTER     50 

Hanuman  and  his  Companions  enter  the  Rikshabila  Cavern 

The  Monkey  Hanuman,  in  company  with  the  General  Tara  and 
Angada,  once  again  explored  the  deep  woods  and  ravines  of  the 
Vindhya  range.  Those  monkeys  searched  the  caverns  which 
resounded  with  the  roar  of  lions  and  tigers  as  well  as  the  in- 
accessible and  mighty  torrents.  Finally  they  came  to  the  south' 
western  summit  of  the  mountain  and,  while  they  rested  there, 
time  passed. 

*93 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

That  region  is  hard  to  explore  on  account  of  the  vast  extent 
of  the  forests  and  the  dangerous  ravines  and  caverns ;  neverthe- 
less the  Son  of  the  Wind  examined  it  all  thoroughly.  Separated 
from  each  other  by  a  short  distance,  Gaja,  Gavaksha,  Gavaya, 
Sharabha,  Gandhamadana,  Mainda,  Dvivida,  Hanuman  and 
Jambavan,  the  youthful  Prince  Angada  and  Tara,  dwellers  of 
the  woods,  began  to  search  those  regions  in  the  south  covered 
by  the  mountain  range. 

While  they  were  exploring  this  place  on  every  side,  they 
observed  the  opening  to  a  cave  named  Rikshabila,  difficult  of 
entry,  guarded  by  a  giant.  Tortured  with  hunger  and  thirst  and 
overcome  with  exhaustion  they  espied  this  cavity  overgrown  by 
trees,  bushes  and  creepers,  from  which  herons,  swans,  geese 
and  waterfowl  were  issuing,  dripping  with  water  and  covered 
with  the  pollen  of  lotuses. 

Drawing  near  to  that  fragrant  cave,  difficult  of  access,  those 
monkeys  were  struck  with  astonishment  and  desired  to  enter  it. 
Then  those  foremost  of  monkeys,  seeing  signs  of  water,  full  of 
joy,  approached  that  subterranean  chamber  abounding  in  every 
kind  of  creature,  resembling  the  abode  of  Indra,  which  was  im- 
penetrable and  fearful  to  behold. 

And  Hanuman,  the  son  of  the  Wind-god,  who  resembled 
the  peak  of  a  mountain,  said  to  those  redoubtable  monkeys, 
who  dwelt  in  the  woods  and  forests  : — "  We  have  explored  the 
southern  region  covered  with  a  chain  of  mountains ;  we  are 
exhausted  with  fatigue  and  unable  to  find  Maithili.  From 
yonder  cave,  swans,  cranes,  herons  and  waterfowl  are  emerging 
on  every  side,  drenched  with  water.  Without  doubt  there  is  a 
well  or  pool  to  be  found  there  for  these  trees  at  the  mouth  of  the 
cave  are  green." 

Hanuman  having  spoken  thus,  all  the  monkeys  entered  into 
the  dark  cave,  bereft  of  sun  and  moon,  that  caused  their  hair  to 
stand  on  end.  They  heard  the  roar  of  lions  and  the  sound  of  deer 
and  birds  and  those  invincible  monkeys  felt  their  courage  and 
prowess  fail ;  moving  with  the  speed  of  the  wind  and  despite 
the  darkness,  their  sight  being  unimpaired,  they  penetrated 
deep  into  the  cave  and  beheld  a  luminous,  enchanting  and 
marvellous  region  filled  with  different  kinds  of  trees  of  varying 
fragrance.  Pressing  close  to  one  another,  they  advanced  four 
394 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

miles  into  the  interior  and  fainting  with  fatigue,  bewildered, 
seeking  for  water,  they  continued  to  descend  into  the  darkness. 
Emaciated,  their  faces  woe-begone,  spent,  despairing  of  their 
lives,  those  monkeys  then  beheld  a  light.  Happily  they 
approached  that  spot  and  saw  trees  glistening  like  gold,  posses- 
sing the  brilliance  of  fire,  and  they  beheld  Salas,  Talas,  Tamalas, 
Punnagas,  Vanjulas,  Dnavas,  Champakas,  Nagavrikshas  and 
Karnikaras  in  full  flower  with  clusters  of  golden  blossom, 
crimson  buds,  twigs  and  creepers  adorning  them,  dazzling  as  the 
dawn,  their  trunks  being  of  emerald  and  their  bark  luminous. 
There  were  also  lakes  of  blue  lotus,  abounding  in  waterfowl, 
there,  and  great  golden  trees  encircled  that  place,  that  shone  like 
the  first  light  of  dawn  and  fishes  of  gold  and  enormous  lotuses 
were  to  be  seen  in  pools  of  tranquil  waters.  Gold  and  silver 
palaces  were  to  be  found  there  with  little  windows  of  refined 
gold  festooned  with  chains  of  pearls,  the  floors  paved  with 
silver  and  gold  and  encrusted  with  pearls  and  diamonds. 

And  the  monkeys  beheld  splendid  mansions  everywhere  and 
trees  laden  with  fruit  and  flowers  that  shone  like  coral  and 
precious  gems  and  golden  bees  and  honey  in  abundance. 
Couches  and  marvellous  seats  of  immense  size,  decorated  with 
gold  and  diamonds,  drew  their  gaze,  as  well  as  gold  and  silver 
vessels,  heaps  of  aloes  and  sandal,  pure  foods,  fruits  and  roots, 
cosdy  vehicles,  delicious  syrups,  priceless  raiment  and  great 
piles  of  woollen  cloths  and  wonderful  skins. 

Whilst  wandering  here  and  there  about  that  subterranean 
chamber,  those  courageous  monkeys  beheld  a  woman  at  a  short 
distance  from  them.  Attired  in  robes  of  bark  and  a  black 
antelope  skin,  that  ascetic,  given  to  fasting,  shone  with  a  great 
effulgence. 

Astonished,  those  monkeys  halted  suddenly  and  Hanuman 
addressed  her  saying  : — "  Who  art  thou  ?  To  whom  does  this 
cavern  belong  ?  '* 

Bowing  down  to  that  aged  woman,  Hanuman,  who  resem- 
bled a  mountain,  with  joined  palms,  enquired  of  her:  "Who 
art  thou  ?  To  whom  does  this  retreat,  this  cave  and  its  jewels 
belong?"

The  Tale  of  the  Ascetic 

Having  spoken  thus  to  that  blessed  ascetic  given  to  the  practice 
of  austerity,  who  was  clad  in  bark  and  a  black  antelope  skin, 
Hanuman  added : — 

"  We  entered  this  cave  enveloped  in  darkness  being  wholly 
exhausted  with  hunger  and  thirst  and  overcome  with  fatigue ; 
having  penetrated  into  the  depths  to  seek  for  something  to  eat, 
we  have  become  distracted  on  seeing  all  these  marvels  so  that 
we  have  almost  taken  leave  of  our  senses. 

"  To  whom  do  these  golden  trees  belong,  that  shine  like  the  sun 
about  to  rise  and  these  pure  foods,  roots  and  fruits ; 
these  mansions  of  gold  and  silver  with  their  windows  of  gold 
refined  in  the  crucible  and  their  network  of  pearls  ?  Who  has 
produced  these  golden  trees  covered  with  marvellous  flowers 
and  fruit  emitting  a  delicious  fragrance,  the  golden  lotuses 
that  float  on  the  pure  waters,  the  golden  fish  and  the 
turtles  ?  Are  they  sprung  from  thy  power  or  do  they  owe  their 
existence  to  another?  It  behoves  thee  to  tell  us,  who  are 
ignorant  in  the  matter." 

Hearing  the  words  of  Hanuman,  the  virtuous  ascetic,  engaged 
in  the  welfare  of  all  beings,  replied  to  Hanuman  saying : — "  O 
Foremost  of  Monkeys,  Maya  is  the  name  of  the  magician  of 
great  powers,  by  whom  this  entire  golden  grove  has  been  con- 
structed. He  who  created  this  enchanting  and  celestial  place 
was  formerly  the  chief  architect  of  the  Giants.1  Having  prac- 
tised austerity  for  a  thousand  years  in  the  vast  forest,  he  obtained 
a  boon  from  the  Grandsire  of  the  World,  in  virtue  of  which  he 
attained  complete  mastery  in  his  art,  as  well  as  an  absolute  con- 
trol over  the  materials  required  therein.  Having  accomplished 
everything  ,  that  wonderful  one,  commanding  every  enjoyment, 
for  a  time  lived  happily  in  the  mighty  forest.  Thereafter  he 
conceived  a  great  passion  for  the  nymph  Hema,  whereupon 
Purandara  hurled  his  thunderbolt  at  him  and  slew  him.

"  Then  Brahma  bestowed  this  marvellous  forest  with  his 
golden  mansion  on  Hema  with  the  perpetual  enjoyment  of  her 
desires.  I,  Swayamprabha  by  name,  the  daughter  of 
Merusavarni,  guard  this  dwelling  belonging  to  Hema,  who, 
skilled  in  the  arts  of  dancing  and  singing,  is  my  dear  friend,  O 
Foremost  of  Monkeys  !  By  her  favour,  this  vast  forest  has  been 
given  into  my  hands.  Now  tell  me  for  what  purpose  and  with 
what  motive  you  have  come  hither  ?  Why  are  you  roaming  in 
these  inaccessible  woods  ?  Having  partaken  of  these  fruits  and 
roots  and  drunk  of  the  pure  water,  tell  me  all." 


CHAPTER     52 

Swayamprabha  frees  the  Monkeys  from  the  Cave 

That  virtuous  ascetic,  greatly  mystified,  addressed  all  those 
leaders  of  monkeys  who  were  now  rested,  saying  : — 
"  O  Monkeys,  if,  satisfied  by  the  fruits,  your  fatigue  is  alleviated, 
I  would  fain  listen  to  your  story  if  it  is  fit  to  be  heard  by  me." 

Hearing  these  words,  Hanuman,  the  Son  of  Maruta  began  to 
relate  all  with  perfect  candour,  saying :  "  The  Sovereign  of  the 
whole  world,  Rama,  who  is  equal  to  Mahendra  and  Varuna, 
the  illustrious  son  of  Dasaratha,  retired  to  the  Dandaka  Forest 
in  company  with  his  brother  Lakshmana  and  his  consort  Vaidehi. 
The  latter  was  forcibly  carried  away  by  Ravana. 

"  His  friend  is  that  valiant  monkey  named  Sugriva.  By  that 
monarch,  the  foremost  of  monkeys,  we  have  been  sent  hither 
and  with  the  assistance  of  those  led  by  Angada,  we  have  been  dis- 
patched to  search  the  southern  region  inhabited  by  Agastya  and 
protected  by  Yama.  We  have  been  commissioned  to  search  for 
Sita,  the  daughter  of  Videha  and  the  demon  Ravana,  who  is 
able  to  change  his  form  at  will.  Having  scoured  the  forests  and 
the  seas  of  the  south,  overcome  with  hunger,  we  sat  down  at  the 
foot  of  the  trees.  Our  faces  drained  of  colour,  absorbed  in 
thought,  we  were  sunk  in  an  ocean  of  anxiety  which  we  were 
unable  to  cross. 

"  Casting  our  eyes  round,  we  observed  a  huge  cave  hidden  by 
trees  and  creepers  and  enveloped  in  gloom.    Now  swans,  geese

and  osprey  flew  out  from  that  cave  their  wings  dripping  with 
water,  and  I  said  to  those  monkeys,  '  Let  us  enter  there ! ' 
which  all  agreed  to  do.  Anxious  to  accomplish  our  purpose,  we 
went  in  grasping  each  others  hands,  thus  forcing  an  entry  into 
that  dark  cave ;  this  is  our  purpose  and  the  reason  why  we  have 
come  hither.  Having  come  here,  famished  and  exhausted,  we, 
who  were  sorely  tried  by  hunger,  have  been  entertained  on  fruits 
and  roots  with  the  traditional  hospitality.  Thou  hast  saved  us, 
who  were  weary  and  suffering  from  starvation  ;  now  say  what 
service  the  monkeys  may  render  thee  in  return  ?  " 

Thus  addressed  by  the  apes,  the  all-knowing  Swayamprabha 
replied  to  those  monkey  leaders,  saying :  "  I  am  well  pleased 
with  all  these  excellent  monkeys ;  I  am  but  fulfilling  my  duty  and 
have  no  need  of  anything." 

Thus  answered  in  words  filled  with  nobility  and  virtue, 
Hanuman  addressed  that  irreproachable  lady  saying:  "We 
have  all  found  refuge  with  thee,  O  Virtuous  Ascetic,  but  the  time 
fixed  by  the  magnanimous  Sugriva  has  run  out  since  we  entered 
the  cave,  it  behoves  thee,  therefore,  to  assist  us  to  leave  this  place. 
If  the  commands  of  Sugriva  be  disregarded,  it  will  mean  death 
for  us.  Please  deliver  us  all ;  the  fear  of  Sugriva  afflicts  us. 
Great  is  the  task  that  has  been  undertaken  by  us  and  if  we  remain 
here,  that  work  of  ours  will  not  be  accomplished." 

Thus  addressed  by  Hanuman,  the  ascetic  answered  him  say- 
ing : — "  For  a  living  being  to  emerge  from  this  cave  alive,  is 
hard,  but  by  the  power  of  my  asceticism  acquired  through  self 
control  I  shall  deliver  all  the  monkeys  from  this  subterranean 
chamber.  Do  you  all  close  your  eyes,  for  none  will  succeed  in 
issuing  from  this  place  if  their  eyes  remain  open." 

Then,  desirous  of  going  out,  all  those  magnanimous  monkeys 
instantly  closed  their  eyes  covering  them  with  their  hands, 
possessed  of  slender  fingers,  and  in  the  twinkling  of  an  eye,  the 
ascetic  transported  them  outside  the  cave  and  having  saved  them 
from  danger,  in  order  to  encourage  them,  said : — 

"  This  is  the  auspicious  Vindhya  Mountain  covered  with 
trees  and  herbs,  there  the  Prasravana  Mountain  and  the  great 
ocean.  May  good  fortune  attend  you !  X  go  to  my  abode,  O 
Foremost  of  Monkeys." 

With  these  words  Swayamprabha  re-entered  the  cave.

CHAPTER     53 

Angada  and  his  Companions  consider  what  Course  to  take 

Then  the  monkeys  beheld  that  awe-inspiring  ocean,  the  abode 
of  Varuna,  shoreless,  thunderous  and  abounding  in  huge 
billows. 

Now  the  month  fixed  by  the  king  as  the  term  set  for  the  search 
had  passed  while  they  were  exploring  that  mountain  fastness, 
the  miraculous  creation  of  Maya.  Sitting  down  at  the  foot  of 
the  Vindhya  Mountain  amidst  the  blossoming  trees,  those  high- 
souled  monkeys  anxiously  began  to  reflect  among  themselves. 

Perceiving  the  spring  trees  bending  beneath  the  weight  of 
flowers  interlaced  by  hundreds  of  creepers,  they  were  filled  with 
apprehension.  Recognizing  the  advent  of  spring  and  knowing 
the  time  appointed  for  their  task  had  run  out,  each  in  turn  sank 
to  the  ground. 

Then  that  monkey  having  the  shoulders  of  a  lion,  with  plump 
and  long  arms,  the  youthful  Prince  Angada,  endowed  with 
wisdom,  duly  honouring  the  aged  apes  and  other  dwellers  in  the 
woods,  spoke  thus : — 

"  At  the  command  of  the  monarch  of  the  monkeys,  we  set  out 
and,  while  we  sojourned  in  the  cave,  a  full  month  has  passed 
away,  O  Monkeys.  The  month  Ashvayuj 1  was  the  time  fixed, 
which  was  not  to  be  exceeded.  This  is  known  to  you !  What 
should  now  be  done  ?  Receiving  the  mandate  from  your  master, 
you  who  are  his  trusted  men,  politic,  devoted  to  his  welfare, 
skilled  in  every  work,  incomparable  in  its  execution  and  re- 
nowned in  every  quarter,  have  set  out  on  this  campaign  with 
me  as  your  appointed  leader.  Now,  having  failed  to  attain  our 
objective,  we  shall  certainly  die,  of  this  there  is  no  shadow  of 
doubt.  Who,  failing  to  execute  the  commands  of  the  King  of 
the  Monkeys,  can  live  at  ease  ?  The  time  allotted  by  Sugriva 
has  run  out,  all  that  remains  is  for  us,  the  dwellers  in  the  woods, 
to  die  fasting.  Stern  by  nature,  jealous  of  his  authority,  he  will 
not  forgive  us  if  we  return  having  transgressed  his  orders.  He

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

will  regard  it  as  a  crime  if  we  come  before  him  without  news  of 
Sita ;  it  is  therefore  better  to  allow  ourselves  to  die  of  hunger  here 
than  give  up  all  hope  of  seeing  our  sons,  wives,  wealth  and  homes. 
It  were  preferable  to  die  here  than  perish  ignominously  at  the 
hands  of  Sugriva.  Further,  I  was  not  installed  as  heir-apparent 
by  Sugriva  but  by  Rama,  that  king  among  men  of  immortal 
exploits.  Entertaining  enmity  to  me  of  old,  the  king,  finding 
me  at  fault,  will  determine  to  take  my  life  by  cruel  means.  Of 
what  use  is  it  to  meet  death  in  the  presence  of  my  friends  who 
will  witness  the  last  moments  of  my  existence  ?  I  shall  remain 
here  en  the  sacred  shore  of  the  sea  for  the  last  supreme  fast." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  crown  prince,  all  those  monkeys, 
exclaimed  in  sympathy : — 

"  Sugriva  is  harsh  by  nature  and  Raghava  is  devoted  to  his 
tender  spouse.  The  king,  perceiving  that  the  time  has  past 
without  our  having  been  successful  in  our  undertaking  and  that 
we  have  not  found  Vaidehi,  will  certainly  put  us  to  death  in 
order  to  do  what  is  agreeable  to  Rama.  Those  who  fail  (to 
execute  his  commands)  may  not  enter  the  presence  of  a  king. 
Having  come  hither  as  the  principal  servants  of  Sugriva,  we  must 
either  find  Sita  or  obtain  information  concerning  her  or  else  we 
must  enter  the  region  of  Yama,  O  Hero." 

Hearing  the  monkeys  speak  thus  in  their  terror,  the  General 
Tara  said  : — "  Of  what  use  is  it  to  yield  to  despair  ?  Let  us  re- 
enter the  subterranean  chamber  and  take  up  our  abode  there. 
That  place  abounding  in  flowers,  food  and  water,  which  has 
been  created  by  the  power  of  illusion,  is  inaccessible.  There 
we  need  not  fear  Purandara  Himself  or  Raghava  or  the  King  of 
the  Monkeys." 

At  these  words  to  which  Angada  himself  assented,  all  the 
monkeys  with  renewed  confidence,  cried : — "  Without  delay,  let 
us  from  now  on  employ  those  means  that  will  save  us  from 
death."

CHAPTER     54 

Hanuman  seeks  to  discourage  Angada  from  his  Design 

When  the  General  Tara,  who  was  as  radiant  as  the  moon,  had 
spoken  thus,  Hanuman  deemed  that  Angada  had  already  usurped 
supreme  authority.  He  knew  the  son  of  Bali  to  be  endowed 
with  the  eightfold  intelligence,  the  four  powers  and  the  fourteen 
qualities,1  to  be  possessed  of  valour,  energy  and  martial  ardour, 
waxing  in  glory  like  the  moon  in  the  bright  fortnight,  the  equal  of 
Brihaspati  in  wisdom,  in  bravery  resembling  his  sire  and  obedient 
to  Tara's  counsel  as  Purandara  regards  the  instruction  of  Shukra.2 

Thereupon,  Hanuman,  versed  in  all  branches  of  learning, 
resolved  to  win  over  Angada,  who  had  become  lax  in  the  service 
of  his  sovereign  and  bring  him  back  to  the  right  path.  Reflecting 
on  the  four  means  for  bringing  about  peace,  he  chose  the  second, 
that  of  sowing  dissension  amongst  the  monkeys  by  subtle 
suggestion  ;  when  the  disaffection  was  general,  he  sought  to 
instil  fear  in  Angada's  heart,  by  harsh  words  uttered  in  severe 
tones : — 

He  said : — "  O  Son  of  Bali,  surely  thou  art  a  warrior  more 
skilful  even  than  thy  sire  and  art  able  to  govern  the  monkey 
kingdom  as  well  as  he,  but,  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  the  apes 
were  ever  fickle  by  nature.  Bereft  of  their  wives  and  sons,  they 
will  never  suffer  thy  rule.    This  I  declare  to  thee  in  the  presence

of  all !  Neither  by  conciliation,  gifts  nor  penalties  shalt  thou 
succeed  in  drawing  Jambavan,  Nila,  the  mighty  ape,  Suhotra,  or 
myself  to  thy  side.  One  who  is  strong  can  overcome  the  weak 
and  usurp  his  place,  therefore,  he  who  is  weak  should,  for  his 
own  safety,  never  incur  the  enmity  of  the  strong.  This  cave, 
that  thou  deemest  to  be  a  safe  refuge  and  which  is  said  to  be 
impregnable,  can  easily  be  penetrated  by  Lakshmana  with  his 
arrows.  Formerly  this  tiny  rift  was  made  by  Indra  hurling  his 
thunderbolt  against  it,  but  Lakshmana  will  pierce  it  like  a  leaf 
by  means  of  his  keen  arrows.  He  possesses  innumerable 
arrows  of  this  kind,  whose  impact  resembles  lightning,  capable 
of  shattering  the  mountains  themselves. 

"  O  Scourge  of  Thy  Foes,  as  soon  as  thou  dost  install  thyself 
in  that  place,  the  monkeys,  remembering  their  wives  and  sons, 
will  decide  to  forsake  thee.  Pining  for  domestic  happiness,  ever 
restless,  anxious  and  weary  of  their  pitiable  plight,  they  will 
abandon  thee.  Thereafter,  bereft  of  friends,  relatives  and  those 
who  seek  thy  welfare,  even  the  trembling  of  a  blade  of  grass  will 
fill  thee  with  terror. 

"  Lakshmana's  arrows,  irresistible  in  flight,  keen,  formidable 
and  of  exceeding  velocity,  will  transfix  thee  where  thou  hast 
sought  to  conceal  thyself. 

"  If,  however,  assuming  a  humble  guise,  thou,  with  us,  dost 
present  thyself  before  Sugriva,  he  will  establish  thee  in  the 
kingdom  and  restore  thee  as  rightful  heir.  A  virtuous  monarch, 
firm  in  his  vows,  honorable  and  loyal,  he  desires  thy  welfare  and 
will  assuredly  not  kill  thee.  Thy  paternal  uncle  is  devoted  to 
thy  mother  and  wishes  to  do  what  is  agreeable  to  her,  this  is 
the  purpose  of  his  life  and  she  has  no  other  son,  therefore,  O 
Angada,  return  with  us."

CHAPTER     55 

The  Monkeys  decide  to  die  of  Hunger 

Hearing  Hanuman's  speech  uttered  with  humility,  filled  with 
wisdom  and  justice  and  reflecting  honour  on  Sugriva,  Angada 
answered  him  saying : — 

"  Stability,  purity  of  mind  and  disposition,  compassion, 
rectitude,  daring  and  perseverance  are  unknown  to  Sugriva. 
He  who,  while  her  son  was  living,  united  himself  to  the  beloved 
queen  of  his  elder  brother,  on  whom  he  should  rightfully  have 
looked  as  a  mother,  is  to  be  condemned.  What  does  he  know  of 
morality  who,  while  his  brother  was  in  the  grip  of  an  Asura, 
closed  up  the  opening  of  the  cave  ?  What  gratitude  will  he 
manifest  who,  having  clasped  his  hand  in  friendship,  forgot  the 
favours  received  from  his  great  benefactor,  Raghava,  of  im- 
perishable deeds  ?  Where  is  righteousness  in  one  who  directed 
us  to  search  for  Sita  here,  not  from  fear  of  disloyalty  but  of 
Lakshmana  ?  Who  would  trust  that  fickle,  impious  and  un- 
grateful wretch,  more  especially  those  sprung  from  his  own  race  ? 
Whether  he  be  possessed  of  good  qualities  or  no,  having  estab- 
lished me  in  the  kingdom,  will  he  suffer  the  son  of  his  enemy  to 
live?  How  can  I,  whose  counsels  have  been  disclosed,  who 
have  been  found  guilty,  who  am  powerless,  poor  and  weak, 
expect  to  survive  if  I  repair  to  Kishkindha  ?  In  his  desire  to 
retain  the  throne,  Sugriva,  who  is  wily,  cunning  and  cruel,  will 
assuredly  place  me  in  chains.  For  me  death  through  fasting  is 
preferable  to  being  tortured  and  confined.  Let  all  the  monkeys 
abandon  me  here  and  return  home.  I  vow  I  shall  never  re- 
enter the  city  but  shall  stay  here  and  fast  to  the  end ;  death  is 
better  for  me. 

"  Bowing  to  the  king  and  also  to  the  mighty  Raghava,  enquire 
after  their  welfare  for  me  and  bring  news  of  my  health  and  state 
to  my  adopted  mother  Ruma.  To  Tara,  my  real  mother,  offer 
consolation,  for  she  is  compassionate  and  pious  and  naturally 
full  of  love  for  her  son.  When  she  learns  of  my  death,  she  will 
certainly  yield  up  her  life." 

303 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Having  said  this,  Angada,  making  obeisance  to  the  elders,  his 
countenance  woe-begone,  weeping,  spreading  out  some  kusha 
grass  sat  down  on  the  ground  ;  as  he  sat  there,  those  foremost 
of  monkeys  groaned,  burning  tears  falling  from  their  eyes. 
Thereupon  surrounding  Angada,  condemning  Sugriva  and 
praising  Bali,  those  monkeys  resolved  to  starve  themselves  to 
death  and,  seating  themselves  on  the  seashore  on  heaps  of  darbha 
grass,  pointing  towards  the  south,  those  excellent  monkeys 
sipping  water,  facing  the  east,  resolved  to  die,  saying : — "  This  is 
better  for  us  !  " 

As  they  spoke  of  the  exile  of  Rama,  the  death  of  Dasaratha, 
the  carnage  in  Janasthana,  the  slaying  of  Jatayu,  the  abduction  of 
Vaidehi,  the  killing  of  Bali  and  the  wrath  of  Raghava, 
those  monkeys  were  filled  with  fear  ;  and  while  those  in- 
numerable monkeys,  resembling  the  peaks  of  mountains  sat 
there,  the  whole  region  with  its  torrents  and  caverns  resounded 
with  their  lamentations  like  the  roll  of  thunder  in  the  skies.

The  Intervention  of  Sampati 

While  the  monkeys  remained  seated  on  the  mountain  plateau 
resolved  on  their  last  great  fast,  the  King  of  the  Vultures  by 
chance  came  to  that  place.  That  long-lived  bird,  the  fortunate 
brother  of  Jatayu,  was  renowned  for  his  strength  and  prowess. 

Issuing  from  a  cave  on  the  mighty  Vindhya  Mountain,  he 
observed  the  monkeys  seated  there  and,  highly  gratified,  said: — 
"  Every  man  reapeth  the  fruit  of  his  former  acts,  on  account  of 
this,  after  a  long  time,  this  food  comes  to  me.  I  shall  eat  up  these 
monkeys  one  by  one  as  they  die." 

Eyeing  those  apes,  the  Vulture  expressed  himself  thus,  and 
hearing  the  utterance  of  that  famished  bird,  Angada,  full  of 
apprehension,  addressed  Hanuman  in  faint  accents,  saying : — 

"  Behold,  on  account  of  Sita,  Death,  the  descendant  of 
Vivasvat,  has  come  to  this  place  to  destroy  the  monkeys. 
Rama's  purpose  not  having  been  effected  nor  the  mandate  of  the 
304 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

king  obeyed,  this  calamity  has  overtaken  the  monkeys  unaware. 
Thou  art  conversant  in  detail  with  all  that  Jatayu,  that  Prince  of 
Vultures  did  for  the  sake  of  Sita.  All  beings,  even  those  born 
of  the  mating  of  beasts,  desire  to  please  Rama  at  the  cost  of  their 
lives  as  we  have  done.  On  account  of  Rama's  love  and  com- 
passion, people  bear  each  other  affection  and  pity.  The  blessed 
Jatayu  voluntarily  laid  down  his  life  for  the  good  of  Rama ; 
we  too,  exhausted  and  about  to  die,  came  to  this  forest  to  render  a 
service  to  the  Son  of  Raghu.  We  have  searched  the  woods  in 
vain  for  Maithili.  Happy  is  that  Prince  of  Vultures  who  was 
slain  in  combat  by  Ravana  for  he  is  freed  from  the  fear  of  Sugriva 
and  has  attained  the  supreme  abode.  The  death  of  Jatayu  and 
King  Dasaratha  and  the  abduction  of  Sita  has  placed  the  monkeys 
in  jeopardy.  The  sojourn  of  Rama  and  Lakshmana  in  the  forest 
with  Sita,  Raghava's  slaying  of  Bali  with  an  arrow,  the  slaughter 
of  innumerable  demons  by  Rama  in  his  wrath,  all  owe  their 
origin  to  those  boons  granted  to  Kaikeyi." 

Hearing  these  piteous  words  and  seeing  the  monkeys  stretched 
on  the  ground  the  magnanimous  King  of  the  Vultures  was 
deeply  moved  and  that  sharp  beaked  bird  cried  out : — 

"  Who  is  it  who,  causing  my  heart  to  tremble,  speaks  thus  of 
the  death  of  my  brother,  dearer  to  me  than  life  itself  ?  How  did 
the  demon  and  the  vulture  come  to  fight  in  Janasthana  ?  It  is 
after  a  long  time  that  I  hear  the  name  of  my  brother  spoken.  I 
wish  to  descend  from  this  lofty  mountain  height.  I  am  well 
pleased  to  hear  of  my  youthful  and  valiant  brother,  renowned 
for  his  exploits.  I  wish  to  learn  of  the  death  of  my  brother, 
Jatayu,  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  and  how  King  Dasaratha,  whose 
elder  son  is  Rama,  beloved  of  his  elders,  came  to  be  his  friend  ? 
I  am  unable  to  fly  in  consequence  of  my  wings  having  been 
scorched  by  the  rays  of  the  sun.  Assist  me  to  descend  from  this 
mountain,  O  Conquerers  of  your  Foes  !  "

THE    RAMAYANA'  OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     57 

Angada's  'Narrative 

Though  the  voice  of  Sampati  faltered  on  account  of  grief,  the 
Chiefs  of  the  Monkeys  did  not  trust  him,  doubting  his  in- 
tentions. 

Seated  for  the  purpose  of  fasting  to  death,  the  monkeys, 
seeing  that  vulture,  framed  the  following  resolution,  saying  : — 

"  Let  us  help  him  to  descend  and  he  will  then  devour  us  all ; 
should  he  do  so,  while  we  are  seated  here  fasting,  we  shall  have 
achieved  our  purpose  and  shall  speedily  attain  success." 

Having  thus  resolved,  they  assisted  the  vulture  to  descend 
from  the  summit  of  the  mountain  and  Angada  addressed  him 
saying : — 

"  There  was  a  great  King  of  the  Monkeys  named  Riksharajas, 
the  founder  of  our  race ;  he  was  my  grandsire,  O  Bird.  He  had 
two  virtuous  sons,  Bali  and  Sugriva,  both  were  exceedingly 
powerful.  My  father  Bali,  was  famed  throughout  the  world  for 
his  exploits. 

"  Now  it  happened  that  the  Sovereign  of  the  whole  earth, 
the  descendant  of  Ikshwaku,  the  great  and  illustrious  car  warrior, 
Rama,  the  son  of  King  Dasaratha,  obedient  to  the  injunctions  of 
his  sire,  fixed  in  the  path  of  righteousness,  entered  the  forest  of 
Dandaka  with  his  brother  Lakshmana  and  his  consort  Vaidehi. 
His  spouse  was  forcibly  borne  away  from  Janasthana  by 
Ravana  and  the  friend  of  Rama's  father,  the  Prince  of  Vultures, 
Jatayu,  observed  Sita,  Videha's  daughter,  being  carried  through 
the  air.  Having  shattered  Ravana's  chariot  and  released 
Maithili,  that  vulture  being  old  and  exhausted  finally  fell  under 
Ravana's  blows.  Slain  by  the  powerful  Ravana,  he  had  his 
funeral  rites  performed  by  Rama  himself  and  attained  the 
celestial  abode.  Then  Raghava  allied  himself  with  my  paternal 
uncle,  Sugriva,  and  slew  my  sire,  who  had  banished  him  from 
the  kingdom  with  his  ministers. 

"  Having  killed  Bali,  Rama  installed  Sugriva  as  Lord  and 
Monarch  of  all  the  Monkeys.  We  have  been  sent  by  him  in  all 
306 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

directions  under  Rama's  orders  to  search  for  Sita  but  we  have  not 
found  Vaidehi,  as  by  night  one  is  unable  to  perceive  the  splendour 
of  the  sun.  Having  explored  the  Dandaka  Forest,  we,  through 
ignorance,  penetrated  into  a  cave  through  a  rift  in  the  earth. 
That  cavern  was  constructed  by  the  illusive  power  of  Maya  and 
there  we  passed  the  month  fixed  by  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  as 
the  term  appointed  ;  while  executing  the  commands  of  Sugriva, 
we  exceeded  the  time  fixed  and  from  fear  have  seated  ourselves 
here,  resolved  to  die  of  hunger,  for,  if  we  return  to  face  the 
wrath  of  Kakutstha,  Sugriva  and  Lakshmana,  we  shall  surely 
be  put  to  death !  " 


CHAPTER      58 

Sampatt  tells  the  monkeys  of  Stta's  Place  of  Concealment 

Hearing  the  pitiful  narrative  of  the  monkeys,  who  had  resolved 
to  give  up  their  lives,  the  vulture  in  mournful  accents,  with  tears 
in  his  eyes,  answered  them  saying : — 

"  O  Monkeys,  you  have  told  me,  that  Jatayu,  my  younger 
brother,  was  slain  in  combat  by  Ravana,  who  was  his  superior  in 
strength.  Old  and  bereft  of  my  wings,  I  can  only  resign  myself 
to  these  tidings  for  I  no  longer  nave  the  power  to  avenge  my 
brother's  death. 

"  Formerly,  when  Indra  slew  the  demon  Vritra,  my  brother 
and  I,  wishing  to  prove  which  of  us  was  superior,  soared  into 
the  sky,  drawing  nearer  and  nearer  to  the  sun  with  its  aureole  of 
rays.  Flinging  ourselves  into  the  currents  of  air,  we  rose  rapidly 
higher  and  higher,  but  the  sun  having  reached  its  zenith,  Jatayu 
grew  faint.  Seeing  my  brother  tormented  by  the  sun's  rays,  I 
covered  him  affectionately  with  my  wings,  for  he  was  suffering 
greatly,  whereupon  they  were  scorched  and  I  fell  on  the  Vindhya 
Mountain,  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  where  I  remained,  not 
knowing  what  had  befallen  him." 

Thus  addressed  by  Sampati,  Jatayu's  brother,  the  eminently 
sagacious  Prince  Angada  answered : — '*  If  thou  art  indeed  the 
brother  of  Jatayu  and  hast  heard  what  I  have  related,  then  tell 
307  x 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

us,  dost  thou  know  aught  of  that  titan's  abode  ?  Say,  if  thou 
knowest,  whether  the  retreat  of  that  short-sighted,  vilest  of 
demons,  Ravana,  is  near  or  far  away  ?  " 

Then  the  illustrious  elder  brother  of  Jatayu  answered  in 
words  worthy  of  him,  causing  delight  to  the  monkeys,  and  said : 
"  O  Monkeys,  my  pinions  being  burnt,  I  am  a  vulture  bereft  of 
strength,  yet  by  my  words  alone,  I  shall  render  Rama  a  signal 
service. 

"  I  know  the  realm  of  Varuna  and  those  covered  by  Vishnu's 
three  strides.  I  am  also  conversant  with  the  wars  between  the 
Gods  and  Asuras  and  the  churning  of  the  ocean,  from  whence 
the  Amrita  issued.  Though  age  has  deprived  me  of  strength  and 
my  vitality  is  ebbing  away,  this  mission  of  Rama's  must  be-  my 
first  concern. 

"  I  saw  a  young  and  lovely  woman,  beautifully  attired,  being 
carried  off  by  the  wicked  Ravana  and  that  beautiful  creature  was 
crying  out  *  O  Rama ', '  O  Rama ', '  O  Lakshmana  '.  Tearing 
off  her  ornaments  she  cast  them  on  the  earth  ;  her  silken  cloak, 
resembling  the  rays  of  the  sun  striking  on  a  mountain  summit, 
shone  against  the  dark  skin  of  the  demon  like  a  lightning  flash 
irradiating  a  cloudy  sky.  Since  she  was  calling  '  Rama ', 
*  Rama  '  I  believe  her  to  have  been  Sita.  Now  hear  me,  and  I 
will  tell  you  where  the  abode  of  that  demon  is  to  be  found. 

"  The  son  of  Vishravas  and  brother  of  Kuvera,  that  demon, 
named  Ravana,  resides  in  the  city  of  Lanka,  constructed  by 
Vishwakarma,  which  lies  a  full  hundred  yojanas  from  here  on 
an  island  in  the  sea,  furnished  with  golden  gateways  and 
ramparts  of  Kancana  gold,  with  lofty  palaces  gleaming  with 
Hema  gold  adorning  it.  A  great  wall,  bright  as  the  sun,  en- 
circles it,  and  it  is  there  that  the  unfortunate  Vaidehi,  attired 
in  a  silken  cloth,  is  confined  in  Ravana's  inner  apartments, 
carefully  guarded  by  demon  women.  It  is  there  you  will 
find  Sita. 

"  Four  hundred  miles  from  here  on  the  southern  shore  of  the 
sea  dwells  Ravana.  O  Monkeys,  hie  thither  speedily  and 
demonstrate  your  valour  !  By  supernatural  means,  I  know  that 
having  seen  that  place  you  will  return.  The  first  course  is  the 
path  taken  by  the  fork-tailed  shrikes  and  others  living  on  grain  ; 
the  second  by  those  who  live  on  insects  and  fruit ;  the  third  by 
308 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

cocks ;  the  fourth  by  herons,  hawks  and  birds  of  prey ;  the 
fifth  by  vultures ;  the  sixth  by  swans  endowed  with  strength, 
energy,  youth  and  beauty  and  the  last  by  eagles  ;  we  have  all 
derived  our  origin  from  Vainateya,1  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys. 
I  shall  avenge  that  execrable  deed  of  that  eater  of  flesh  (Ravana)  as 
also  his  cruelty  to  my  brother.1 

"  Resting  here,  I  am  able  to  see  Ravana  and  Janaki,  for  we  all 
possess  the  supersensual  sight  of  Suparna.3  It  is  by  virtue  of 
our  nature  and  on  account  of  the  food  we  eat,  that  we  can  see 
clearly  to  a  distance  of  four  hundred  miles.  We  are  instinctively 
drawn  to  search  for  our  food  at  a  distance,  whilst  other  birds 
scratch  it  up  with  their  claws  at  the  foot  of  the  trees  where  they 
roost,  their  sight  being  limited. 

"  Do  ye  look  about  for  a  means  to  cross  over  the  salty  waves ; 
having  found  Vaidehi,  return,  your  purpose  accomplished. 
Now  I  desire  to  be  taken  by  you  to  the  shore  of  the  sea,  the  abode 
of  Varuna ;  I  will  there  perform  the  water  ritual  for  the  spirit 
of  my  high-souled  brother,  who  has  gone  to  the  celestial  abode." 

At  those  words  those  mighty  monkeys  carried  Sampati,  whose 
wings  had  been  burnt,  to  the  shore  of  the  ocean,  after  which  they 
brought  back  that  King  of  the  Birds  to  the  Vindhya  Mountain ; 
and,  having  received  the  information  concerning  Sita,  they 
experienced  great  joy. 


CHAPTER     59 

He  encourages  them  to  pursue  their  Quest 

Hearing  these  words,  sweet  as  nectar,  uttered  by  the  Vulture 
King,  the  monkey  chiefs  were  filled  with  relief. 

Then  Jambavan,  the  foremost  among  the  apes,  with  all  the 
monkeys,  rising  from  the  ground,  said  to  the  Vulture  King : — 
"  Where  is  Sita  ?  Who  has  seen  her?  Who  has  carried  away 
Mithila's  daughter  ?    Do  thou  tell  us  all  this,  and  thus  be  the 

1  Vainateya — The  Eagle  Garuda.  said  to  be  Vishnu's  messenger  and 
vehicle. 

*  Implying  by  sending  the  monkeys  he  would  be  avenged  on  Ravana. 

*  Suparna — another  name  for  Vainateya  or  Garuda.

means  of  saving  the  dwellers  in  the  woods.  Who  is  able  to 
forget  the  power  of  the  arrows  of  Dasaratha  that  fly  with  the 
speed  of  lightning  and  those  that  are  loosed  by  Lakshmana  ?  M 

Then  Sampati,  once  again  consoling  those  monkeys  who  had 
risen  from  their  fasting  and  who  were  all  attention  to  what  was 
being  related  concerning  Sita,  well  pleased,  said  to  them : — 

"  Hear  how  I  came  to  learn  of  Sita's  abduction  at  this  place 
and  who  it  was  that  told  me  where  that  large-eyed  lady  could  be 
found !  It  is  a  long  time  since  I  fell  on  to  this  inaccessible 
mountain,  many  miles  in  extent.  Now  I  am  old  and  feeble  in 
life  and  limb ;  in  this  condition  my  son,  named  Suparshwa,  the 
best  of  birds,  brought  me  food  regularly.  If  the  Gandharvas 
are  extremely  pleasure  loving  and  the  serpent  race  prone  to 
anger  and  the  deer  exceedingly  timid,  we,  in  our  turn,  are 
voracious. 

"  One  day,  tormented  with  hunger,  I  demanded  food  and  my 
son  flew  off  at  sunrise  to  procure  it,  but  returned  at  night  with- 
out any  flesh.  He,  the  increaser  of  my  delight,  had  grown  tired 
of  searching  for  nourishment  and  in  order  to  propitiate  me  said 
in  all  sincerity  : — 

" '  My  dear  father,  wishing  to  bring  thee  thine  accustomed 
portion,  I  flew  into  the  air  and  stationed  myself  near  the  approach 
of  the  Mahendra  Mountain  in  order  to  obstruct  the  passage  of 
thousands  of  creatures  who  range  the  sea.  There  I  was,  look- 
ing down,  guarding  the  pass,  when  suddenly  I  observed  some- 
one resembling  a  mass  of  collyrium,  carrying  a  woman  as 
beautiful  as  the  dawn.  Seeing  them,  I  resolved  to  seize  them  for 
my  prey,  but  he  humbly  implored  me  in  peaceful  accents  to  let 
him  pass.  None  on  earth,  not  even  the  wicked,  devour  the 
peaceful  willingly,  how  much  less  a  creature  like  myself!  He 
passed  on  quickly,  pushing  away  the  air,  as  it  were,  with  his 
energy.  Thereafter,  those  beings  that  inhabit  space  approached 
me  and  paid  obeisance  to  me  and  the  great  Rishis  said  tome: — 

"  '  "  By  good  fortune  Sita  still  lives  !  It  is  well  for  thee  that 
he  has  passed  by  thee  with  this  woman." 

"  *  Then  the  glorious  Siddhas  addressed  me  and  informed 

me  that  it  was  Ravana,  the  King  of  the  Demons,  whom  I  had  seen 

with  the  consort  of  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  the  daughter 

of  Janaka,  who,  her  silken  attire  torn,  overcome  with  an  excess 

310 


KISHKINDHA    KAN  DA 

of  grief,  her  hair  falling  about  her,  was  calling  the  names  of 
"  Rama  "  and  "  Lakshmana  ".  Thus,  0  My  Father,  is  how  the 
time  has  passed/ 

"  All  this  did  Suparshwa  tell  me,  and  even  on  hearing  it  I  did 
not  consider  exerting  my  strength,  for  without  wings,  how  can  a 
bird  undertake  anything  ?  But  hear  how  I  can  help  you  with 
my  word  and  knowledge,  so  that  you  can  manifest  your  prowess  ! 
By  my  speech  and  my  experience  I  will  do  what  is  agreeable  to 
you.  I  shall  make  the  concern  of  the  son  of  Dasaratha  my  con- 
cern, do  not  doubt  it.  Possessed  as  you  are  of  intelligence, 
energy  and  wisdom,  incapable  of  being  overcome  even  by  the 
Gods,  you  have  been  sent  here  by  the  King  of  the  Monkeys. 
The  arrows  of  Rama  and  Lakshmana  furnished  with  heron 
plumes  are  able  to  destroy  the  Three  Worlds.  Although  the 
ten-necked  Ravana  is  endowed  with  strength  and  energy,  yet 
assuredly  none  can  resist  your  united  efforts !  There  is  no  need 
for  further  delay.  Now  accomplish  your  purpose.  The  wise, 
such  as  you,  are  not  dilatory  in  their  undertakings." 


CHAPTER     60 

The  Story  of  the  Ascetic  Nishakara 

When  the  vulture  had  offered  oblations  of  water  for  the  spirit  of 
his  brother  and  performed  his  ablutions,  the  monkey  chiefs  sat 
down  on  that  marvellous  mountain,  placing  him  in  their  midst. 

Then  Sampati,  in  order  to  reassure  them,  said  cheerfully  to 
Angada,  who  was  seated  surrounded  by  all  the  monkeys  who 
escorted  him : — "  Listen  to  me  with  attention  and  in  silence,  O 
Monkeys,  and  I  will  tell  you  truly  how  I  came  to  know  of 
Maithili. 

"  A  long  time  ago,  I  fell  on  the  summit  of  the  Vindhya 
Mountain,  O  Irreproachable  Prince,  my  wings  scorched  by  the 
heat  of  the  sun,  which  consumed  them  with  its  rays.  On  re- 
gaining consciousness  at  the  end  of  six  days,  faint  and  bereft  of 
strength,  looking  round,  I  was  unable  to  distinguish  anything. 
Nevertheless  on  scanning  the  lakes,  rocks,  rivers,  ponds,  woods 
and  countries,  my  memory  returned  and  I  reflected,  *  This 
3" 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

mountain  filled  with  cheerful  birds,  containing  deep  caves  and 
innumerable  ridges  is  certainly  the  Vindhya  Peak  on  the  shores 
of  the  southern  sea.' 

"  Here  lay  a  sacred  hermitage  revered  by  the  Gods  them- 
selves, where  a  Sage  named  Nishakara,  of  severe  austerities, 
dwelt ;  since  that  time,  that  saint  conversant  with  virtue  has 
ascended  to  heaven. 

"  X  passed  eight  thousand  years  on  this  mountain.  Then 
not  having  seen  that  ascetic,  crawling  slowly  and  pain- 
folly  down  from  that  high  peak  to  the  ground  covered  with  sharp 
pointed  grass,  eager  to  see  that  sage,  I  rejoined  him  with  great 
difficulty.    Formerly  Jatayu  and  I  visited  that  sage  many  times. 

"  In  that  neighbourhood,  sort  and  fragrant  breezes  blew  and 
there  was  no  tree  without  flowers  or  fruit.  Approaching  that 
sacred  hermitage,  desirous  of  seeing  the  blessed  Nishakara,  I 
waited  at  the  foot  of  a  tree.  Then,  at  a  distance,  I  beheld  that 
Rishi,  blazing  with  effulgence,  who,  having  performed  his 
ablutions,  was  returning  towards  the  north. 

"  As  all  living  beings  surround  a  giver,  so  was  he  surrounded 
by  bears,  srimaras,  tigers,  lions  and  snakes  of  various  kinds. 
And  when  they  observed  that  the  saint  had  entered  his  hermitage, 
they  all  went  away,  as  when  a  king  retires,  the  ministers  who  have 
escorted  him  withdraw. 

"  The  Sage,  on  seeing  me,  was  pleased,  and  retiring  into  his 
hermitage  for  a  while,  came  out  again  and  enquired  as  to  my 
welfare.  He  said : — '  O  My  Friend,  on  account  of  thy  dis- 
coloured plumes,  I  am  unable  to  recognize  thee ;  thy  two  wings 
have  been  scorched  by  fire  and  thy  trail  frame  is  shaken  by 
gasps.  In  former  times,  I  knew  two  vultures  resembling  the 
wind  in  speed,  who  were  brothers,  able  to  change  their  shape  at 
will.  Thou  art,  I  know,  the  elder,  Sampati,  and  Jatayu  is  thy 
younger  brother.  Both  assuming  human  shape  were  wont  to 
massage  my  feet  with  their  hands. 

"  *  By  what  disease  hast  thou  been  afflicted  ?  From  whence 
comes  the  loss  of  thy  wings  ?  Who  has  inflicted  this  punish- 
ment on  thee  ?    Do  thou  tell  me  all ! '  "

Sampati  tells  his  Story  to  the  Sage  Nishakara 

Thereupon  Sampati  related  to  the  ascetic  the  whole  of  his 
fearful,  arduous  and  rash  act  of  flying  towards  the  sun  : — 

"  O  Blessed  One,  the  wounds  I  have  received,  the  shame  I 
feel  and  the  exhaustion  I  experience,  all  prevent  me  from  enter- 
ing into  a  lengthy  narrative. 

"  From  pride  in  our  power  of  flight,  Jatayu  and  I,  in  order  to 
test  each  other's  powers,  vowing  in  the  presence  of  the  sages  on 
Mt.  Kailasha  that  we  would  follow  the  sun  till  it  set  behind  the 
Astachala  Mountain,  flew  into  the  sky.  Reaching  a  great  height 
together,  we  looked  down  on  the  earth  with  its  various  cities 
that  appeared  like  chariot  wheels.  Sometimes  the  sound  of 
musical  instruments  reached  us,  at  others  the  tinkling  of 
ornaments.  In  certain  places  we  saw  many  damsels  clad  in  red 
who  were  singing. 

"  Passing  rapidly  through  the  air,  we  followed  the  path  of  the 
sun  and  observed  a  forest  intersected  with  green  rides ;  the 
mountains  appeared  like  pebbles  and  the  rivers  like  threads 
binding  the  earth ;  Himavat,  Vindhya  and  that  mighty  mountain, 
Meru  resembled  elephants  standing  in  a  pond. 

"  Nevertheless  we  were  perspiring  freely  and  were  filled  with 
anxiety  and  extremely  fatigued,  no  longer  being  able,  in  our 
bewilderment,  to  distinguish  between  the  south,  west  or  the 
quarter  presided  over  by  Fire ;  the  earth  seemed  to  us  to  have 
been  consumed  by  flames,  as  at  the  end  of  the  world  period. 
My  mind  and  my  eyes  failing,  with  a  violent  effort  I  fixed  them 
on  the  sun  and  with  great  difficulty  succeeded  in  doing  so. 
The  blazing  orb  seemed  to  us  much  larger  than  the  earth  in 
extent,  and  at  that  instant,  Jatayu,  without  speaking  to  me,  began 
to  fall.  Seeing  this,  I  flew  down  from  the  sky  and  covered  him 
with  my  wings,  in  consequence  of  which  my  brother  was  not 
burnt,  but  I,  in  my  arrogance  was  scorched  and  thrown  out  of 
the  wind's  course.  I  surmised  that  Jatayu  had  fallen  in 
313 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Janasthana,  but  my  wings  scathed,  deprived  of  strength,  I  fell 
on  the  Vindhya  Mountain. 

"  Bereft  of  my  dominion,  my  brother,  my  wings  and  my  power, 
I  now  long  to  hurl  myself  headlong  from  the  summit  of  this 
mountain  and  put  an  end  to  my  existence." 


CHAPTER     62 

Sampati  learns  where  Sita  is  from  the  Sage  Nishakara 

"  Having  spoken  thus  to  that  foremost  of  Sages,  in  my  distress, 
I  began  to  weep,  and  that  blessed  One,  reflecting  for  a  while, 
said  to  me  :■■ — 

" '  Thy  two  wings  with  their  feathers  will  grow  again  and  thou 
wilt  recover  thy  sight,  thine  energy  and  thy  prowess.  Having 
learnt  it  from  the  Puranas  and  foreseen  it  by  mine  ascetic  power, 
I  know  that  a  great  event  is  about  to  take  place. 

"  *  It  concerns  a  certain  king,  named  Dasaratha  of  the  race  of 
Ikshwaku,  to  whom  a  son,  full  of  valour,  will  be  bornty  the 
name  of  Rama.  He  will  repair  to  the  forest  with  his  brother 
Lakshmana,  having  been  constrained  to  do  so  by  his  sire. 

"  *  The  son  of  Nairriti,  Ravana,  the  King  of  the  Titans,  in- 
capable of  being  slain  by  Gods  or  Danavas,  will  bear  off  his 
consort  from  the  forest  of  Janasthana.  And,  albeit  tempted  by 
delicious  viands  and  objects  of  enjoyment  and  desire,  that  noble 
and  illustrious  one,  overcome  by  grief,  will  not  partake  of  them. 
Then  Vasava  learning  of  this  will  offer  her  '  payasa  *  resembling 
ambrosia  that  the  Gods  themselves  only  obtain  with  difficulty. 
Receiving  this  food,  Maithili,  knowing  it  to  come  from  Indra, 
will  offer  part  of  it  to  Rama,  by  pouring  it  on  the  ground,  saying : 
— '  Whether  my  husband  or  bis  younger  brother  still  live  or  have 
attained  the  celestial  state,  may  this  food  be  acceptable  to  them.* 

"  *  Rama's  envoys  having  been  sent  hither,  it  will  be  for  thee 
to  inform  them  of  the  facts  relating  to  Sita,  O  Airy  Traveller  ! 
Do  not  go  hence  for  any  reason,  but  whither  canst  thou  go  in 
this  condition?  Wait  for  the  time  and  place;  thou  shalt 
recover  thy  wings.  I  am  able  this  very  day  to  furnish  thee  with 
3M 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

wings  but  by  waiting  here  thou  canst  render  a  service  to  the 
worlds.  Even  so,  thou  shalt  be  doing  thy  duty  to  the  two 
princes,  the  brahmins,  thy  spiritual  preceptors,  the  sages  and 
Indra.  I  also  am  desirous  of  beholding  the  two  brothers,  Rama 
and  Lakshmana,  after  which  I  shall  yield  up  my  life.* 

"  Thus  did  that  great  Rishi,  conversant  with  the  nature  of  all 
things,  speak  to  me." 


chapter    63 

The  Wirtgs  of  Sampati  grow  once  more 

"  Having  consoled  me  with  these  words  and  many  others,  the 
eloquent  ascetic  took  leave  of  me  and  re-entered  his  hermitage. 
Thereafter  I  crawled  slowly  out  of  the  cave  and  scaled  the 
Vindhya  Mountain  to  wait  for  you.  Since  that  time,  a  whole 
century  has  passed,  and,  keeping  the  words  of  that  hermit  in  my 
heart,  I  await  the  time  and  place. 

"  Nishakara  has  ascended  to  heaven  and  I,  distracted  by  many 
thoughts,  have  been  consumed  with  grief.  When  the  idea  of 
death  comes  to  me,  I  put  it  away,  remembering  the  words  of 
the  Sage.  The  determination  he  inspired  in  me  to  preserve  my 
life  dissolves  my  distress,  as  a  flame  in  a  lit  brazier  dispels  the 
darkness. 

"  Though  fully  conversant  with  the  power  of  the  evil-hearted 
Ravana,  yet  I  approached  my  son  saying : — *  Hearing  her 
lamentations  and  knowing  these  two  princes  to  be  deprived 
of  her,  how  is  it  that  thou  didst  not  free  Sita  ? '  In  my  affec- 
tion for  King  Dasaratha  I  was  displeased  with  my  son." 

As  Sampati  was  speaking  thus  to  the  monkeys,  his  wings 
suddenly  began  to  grow  again  in  the  presence  of  those  dwellers 
in  the  woods.  Thereupon  seeing  his  body  covered  with 
tawny  feathers,  he  experienced  an  immense  joy  and 
said  to  those  monkeys : — "  By  the  grace  of  Nishakara,  that 
Sage  of  immeasurable  power,  my  wings,  that  had  been  scorched 
by  the  sun's  rays,  have  grown  again  and  the  prowess  I  possessed 
in  my  youth  has  returned.  To-day  I  have  regained  my  strength 
315 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  vigour.  Do  you  spare  no  effort  to  find  Sita ;  the  recovery 
of  my  wings  is  a  pledge  of  your  success." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  the  monkeys,  Sampati,  the  foremost  of 
birds,  anxious  to  ascertain  his  powers  of  flight,  flew  up  to  the 
mountain  top.  Hearing  his  words,  those  mighty  monkeys  were 
delighted  and  confident  of  their  success,  prepared  to  demonstrate 
their  valour. 

With  the  speed  of  the  wind  those  foremost  of  monkeys,  intent 
upon  finding  Sita,  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  set  out  towards  the 
south  to  the  quarter  dominated  by  Abhijit.1 


CHAPTER     64 

The  Monkeys  are  disconcerted  at  the  sight  of  the  Ocean 

Thus  informed  by  the  King  of  the  Vultures,  the  monkeys, 
endowed  with  the  strength  of  lions,  began  to  leap  about,  emit- 
ting cries  of  delight. 

Hearing  from  Sampati  that  Ravana  would  be  slain,  the  happy 
monkeys  reached  the  sea,  anxious  to  discover  Sita.  And 
coming  to  that  place,  those  redoubtable  warriors  beheld  the 
ocean,  the  mirror  of  the  whole  world. 

Arriving  at  the  northern  side  of  the  southern  sea,  those 
exceedingly  powerful  and  heroic  monkeys  halted  there.  And 
seeing  the  ocean  which  at  times  appeared  to  be  asleep,  at  others 
playful,  sometimes  covered  with  huge  waves  and  thronged  with 
aquatic  animals,  causing  their  hair  to  stand  on  end,  those  fore- 
most of  monkeys  were  amazed  and  became  despondent.  Be- 
holding that  ocean  incapable  of  being  traversed,  even  as  the  sky 
itself,  the  monkeys  began  to  lament,  crying :  "  What  is  now  to 
be  done  ?  " 

Then  the  foremost  of  the  monkeys,  the  mighty  Angada, 
seeing  the  despair  of  the  army  at  the  sight  of  the  sea,  began  to 
reassure  those  warriors  afflicted  with  terror,  saying  : — 

"  One  should  never  give  way  to  agitation,  of  all  things  it  is 

1  Abhijit — the  name  of  a  constellation.  Some  Commentators  translate 
it  as  meaning  "  he  who  is  to  be  conquered  "  implying  the  region  in  which 
Havana  was  to  be  found. 

316 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

the  most  fatal :  agitation  destroys  a  man  even  as  a  provoked 
serpent  doth  a  child.  He  who,  when  the  time  is  ripe  for  dis- 
playing his  valour,  becomes  agitated,  will  grow  weak  and  fail  to 
attain  his  object." 

The  night  having  passed,  Angada  took  counsel  with 
the  older  monkeys,  and  that  monkey  host  surrounding  him 
resembled  the  hosts  of  the  Maruts  surrounding  Vasava.  Who, 
save  Bali's  son  or  Hanuman  was  capable  of  maintaining  dis- 
cipline amongst  those  troops  ? 

Having  called  the  elders  together  in  company  with  the  army, 
the  fortunate  Angada,  the  subduer  of  his  foes,  saluting  them, 
spoke  words  fraught  with  good  sense,  saying : — 

"  Who  amongst  you  is  of  sufficient  stature  to  cross  the  ocean  ? 
Who  is  able  to  carry  out  the  commands  of  Sugriva,  the  conqueror 
of  his  foes  ?  Which  valiant  monkey  can  leap  the  four  hundred 
miles  and  deliver  the  leaders  of  the  monkeys  from  their  great 
anxiety  ?  By  whose  favour  shall  we,  crowned  with  success 
and  content,  return  and  behold  our  wives,  our  sons  and  our 
homes  ?  Who  will  enable  us  to  meet  Rama,  the  mighty  Laksh- 
matia  and  that  dweller  in  the  woods,  Sugriva,  with  a  light  heart  ? 
If  there  be  any  monkey  capable  of  leaping  over  the  ocean,  then 
may  he  show  his  blessed  form  to  us  and  deliver  us  from  fear ! ' 

Hearing  Angada's  speech,  no  one  uttered  a  word  and  the  entire 
monkey  host  appeared  stunned.  Then  that  foremost  of 
monkeys  once  more  addressed  them  saying : — 

"  O  Ye  Excellent  Warriors,  of  tried  valour,  unimpeachable 
family  and  worthy  of  honour,  say  how  far  each  of  you  is  able  to 
leap  over  the  sea  without  any  being  able  to  hinder  you  !  " 


chapter    65 

The  Leaders  of  the  Monkeys  each  state  what  they  are  able  to 
accomplish 

Having  listened  to  Angada's  words,  those  Chiefs  of  Monkeys, 
each  in  turn,  began  to  dilate  on  what  he  was  able  to  accomplish — 
Gaya,  Gavaksha,  Gavaya,  Sharabha,  Gandhamadana,  Mainda, 

317 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Dvivida  and  Angada  as  also  Jambavan.     Gaya  speaking  first, 
said: — 

"  I  can  leap  a  hundred  miles  !  "  and  Gavaksha  said : — "  I 
can  leap  two  hundred  !  "  Then  the  monkey  Sharabha  said  to 
his  companions : — "  I  am  able  to  leap  three  hundred  miles, 
O  Monkeys  !  "  thereafter  Rishabha  said,  "  I  can  undoubtedly 
cross  over  four  hundred  miles  1 "  and  the  mighty  Gandhamadana 
said  "  I  can  leap  five  hundred  miles  !  "  In  his  turn  the  monkey, 
Mainda,  said  "  And  I,  six  hundred  miles  "  and  the  illustrious 
Dvivida  "  Without  difficulty  I  can  leap  over  seven  hundred 
miles  !  "  Then  Sushena,  full  of  energy,  the  best  of  monkeys 
said, "  I  declare  that  I  can  leap  eight  hundred  miles  !  " 

And  as  they  were  speaking  thus,  the  oldest  of  them,  Jambavan, 
offering  salutations  to  them  all,  spoke  in  this  wise: — "  Formerly  I, 
also,  had  the  power  of  motion  but  now  I  am  advanced  in  years. 
Nevertheless  in  the  present  situation,  nothing  should  be  over- 
looked to  assure  the  success  of  both  Rama's  and  the  King  of 
Monkeys'  mission :  I  shall  therefore  leap  three  hundred  miles. 
There  is  no  doubt  whatever  about  this."  Then  Jambavan, 
addressing  all  those  monkeys,  added :  "  Alas  !  I  have  assuredly 
not  the  strength  for  that !  Of  old,  I  circumambulated  the  eternal 
Vishnu  when  he  covered  the  world  in  three  strides  at  the  sacrifice 
of  Virochana's  son  ;  now,  however,  I  am  old  and  tire  quickly. 
When  I  was  young,  my  energy  was  great  and  unmatched ;  to- 
day, I  can  only  go  as  far  as  I  have  told  you,  which  is  not  sufficient 
to  bring  success  to  our  undertaking." 

Thereupon  the  sagacious  Angada,  bowing  to  that  mighty 
monkey,  addressed  him  in  pregnant  words,  saying  :  "I  am 
able  to  leap  these  four  hundred  miles  easily  but  should  I  be  able 
to  return  ?    Nothing  is  certain  !  " 

Thereat  Jambavan  answered  that  excellent  monkey  and  said : 
"  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  thy  power  of  motion  is  well  known, 
but  art  thou  able  to  cross  over  eight  hundred  miles  ?1  It  is 
not  fitting  that  thou  shouldst  do  so.  My  Dear  Son,  the  master 
must  in  no  way  be  commanded  by  his  servants ;  it  is  for  thee  to 
order  this  expedition.  Thou  art  our  leader  and  our  only  good. 
The  head  of  the  army  is,  as  it  were,  the  wife,  who  should  con- 
stantly be  protected  ;  this  is  thy  role,  O  Dear  Child.     One

318 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

should  take  care  of  the  root  of  a  thing,  this  is  the  practice  of 
men  of  experience ;  the  root  being  sound,  the  juices  that  have 
for  their  purpose  the  maturing  of  the  fruit  will  be  safeguarded. 
Thou  art  the  essential  part  of  this  undertaking  and,  O  Subduer 
of  Thy  Foes,  thou,  furnished  with  wisdom  and  valour,  art  the 
principle  underlying  it.  Thou  art  our  superior  and  the  son  of 
our  superior,  O  Excellent  One ;  with  thy  support  we  shall  be 
able  to  accomplish  our  mission." 

Thus,  in  his  great  wisdom,  Jambavan  spoke  and  that  mighty 
monkey  born  of  Bali,  Angada,  answered  him  saying  : — - 

"  If  I  do  not  go  nor  any  among  these  powerful  monkeys  does 
so,  then  undoubtedly  we  must  begin  our  supreme  fast  once 
more,  for  if  we  return  without  having  fulfilled  the  commands 
of  that  lord  of  the  monkeys,  then  I  do  not  see  how  we  can  hope 
to  preserve  our  lives.  Whether  he  show  clemency  or  wrath, 
he  is  the  chief  of  the  monkeys  and  to  disregard  his  will  means 
death.  In  this  matter  no  other  alternative  is  possible ;  there- 
fore it  is  for  you  who  are  able  to  see  clearly  to  reflect  upon  it." 

Thus  spoke  Angada  and  that  powerful  and  heroic  monkey, 
Jambavan,  answered  him  in  felicitous  words  saying : — 

"  O  Warrior,  this  mission  will  be  carried  out  without  obstruc- 
tion !     I  will  call  on  the  one  who  is  able  to  accomplish  it." 

Thereupon  that  heroic  monkey  sent  for  the  foremost  of  the 
apes,  Hanuman,  who  was  sitting  tranquilly  apart. 


CHAPTER      66 

Jambavan  appeals  to  Hanuman  to  sacrifice  himself  for  the  good  of  all 

Perceiving  the  discouragement  of  that  great  army  composed  of 
hundreds  and  thousands  of  monkeys,  Jambavan  said  to 
Hanuman : — 

"  O  Warrior,  foremost  among  the  multitude,  thou  who  art 
versed  in  the  scriptures,  why  art  thou  sitting  apart,  silent  ? 
In  courage  and  strength,  thou  art  the  equal  of  Rama  and  Laksh- 
mana  and  of  the  King  of  the  Monkeys  himself,  O  Hanuman  !

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  ArishtanemiV  son,  the  mighty  Vainateya,  the  illustrious 
Garuda  is  the  foremost  of  all  winged  creatures,  Many  a  time 
I  have  seen  that  all-powerful  bird  of  immense  wings  and  exceed- 
ing energy  bearing  away  serpents  from  the  ocean ;  the  strength 
that  is  in  his  wings  resembles  the  might  and  vigour  of  thine  arms; 
none  can  withstand  thee.  Thine  energy,  intelligence,  courage 
and  loyalty  sets  thee  apart  from  the  rest  of  beings,  therefore 
prepare  thyself  to  cross  the  ocean. 

"  The  most  noble  of  all  the  Apsaras,  Punjika-Thala,  under  the 
name  of  Anjana,  became  the  wife  of  the  monkey  Kesarin.  She 
was  renowned  in  the  three  worlds  and  her  beauty  was  unequalled 
on  earth.  As  a  result  of  a  curse,  O  Friend,  she  was  born  in  the 
monkey  race,  able  to  change  her  form  at  will. 

"  Once  that  daughter  of  the  king  among  the  monkeys,  Kunjara, 
having  assumed  the  form  of  a  woman  radiant  with  youth  and 
beauty,  adorned  with  garlands  of  various  kinds,  clad  in  silk, 
was  wandering  about  on  the  summit  of  a  mountain,  which 
resembled  a  mass  of  clouds  in  the  rainy  season. 

"  And  it  happened  that  the  God  of  the  Wind  stole  away  the 
red-bordered  yellow  robe  of  that  large-eyed  maiden,  who  stood 
on  the  mountain  top.  Then  Maruta  perceived  her  rounded, 
well-proportioned  thighs  and  her  breasts  touching  each  other 
and  her  amiable  and  pleasing  mien.  Beholding  that  youthful 
woman  of  lovely  limbs  and  slender  waist,  her  whole  being  radiant 
with  beauty,  he  was  filled  with  desire  and  beside  himself,  en- 
veloping that  irreproachable  lady  in  his  arms,  Manmatha  em- 
braced her. 

"  In  her  distress,  Anjana,  faithful  to  her  conjugal  vows,  cried 
out : — *  Who  desires  to  sever  the  ties  of  a  woman  devoted  to  her 
lord  ? '  Hearing  these  words,  the  Wind-God  answered,  *  I 
do  not  wish  to  wrong  thee,  O  Lady  of  Lovely  Hips,  let  not  thy 
heart  be  troubled.  By  embracing  thee  and  entering  into  thee 
thou  shalt  bear  a  son  endowed  with  strength  and  intelligence, 
of  immense  energy,  of  noble  nature,  possessed  of  vigour  and 
courage  and  in  agility  and  speed  equal  to  myself.' 

"  These  words  pleased  thy  mother  and  she  gave  birth  to  thee 
in  a  cave,  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys.

"  While  still  a  child,  thou  didst  see  the  sun  rise  over  the  great 
forest  and  taking  it  to  be  a  fruit  sought  to  seize  it.  Bounding 
into  the  air,  thou  didst  mount  up  for  a  thousand  yojanas,  O 
Great  Monkey  and,  though  the  burning  rays  of  the  sun  beat  upon 
thee,  thou  didst  not  falter.  Seeing  thee  rushing  through  space, 
Indra,  full  of  wrath,  hurled  this  thunderbolt  at  thee,  whereupon, 
falling,  thou  didst  fracture  thy  left  jaw  on  the  point  of  a  rock 
from  which  arises  thy  name,  Hanuman.1  Observing  thee  in  this 
state,  Vayu  the  Destroyer,  the  Bearer  of  Fragrance,*  in  the 
height  of  anger,  ceased  to  blow  throughout  the  Three  Worlds. 

"  Then  all  the  Gods  were  distressed  on  account  of  the  calamity 
that  has  befallen  the  worlds  and  these  Lords  of  the  Universe 
sought  to  pacify  the  wrathful  Wind-god,  whereupon  Pavana 
being  placated,  Brahma  accorded  thee  the  boon  of  invulnera- 
bility in  combat.  Seeing  how  thou  didst  sustain  the  impart  of 
the  thunderbolt,  that  God  of  a  Thousand  Eyes  was  pleased  with 
thee  and  also  conferred  an  excellent  boon  on  thee,  saying : — 
'  Thou  shalt  not  die  till  thou  desireth  to  do  so !  Thou,  en- 
dowed with  extreme  vigour,  the  son  of  Kesarin,  resembling  the 
Wind  God  in  energy,  art  born  of  his  loins  and  equal  to  him  in 
speed '.  O  Friend,  we  are  lost,  but  thou,  possessed  of  skill  and 
courage,  art  in  our  midst  a  second  Lord  of  the  Monkeys. 

"  In  the  time  when  Vishnu  covered  the  world  with  three 
strides,  I,  O  Child,  circumambulated  the  earth  with  its  mount- 
ains, forests  and  woods,  one  and  twenty  times.  Then  com- 
missioned by  the  Gods,  we  gathered  all  the  herbs  which  (when 
cast  into  the  sea)  produced  the  nectar  of  immortality  and  at 
that  time  our  strength  was  great.  Now  I  am  old  and  my 
prowess  has  deserted  me,  but  thou,  endowed  with  every  virtue 
art  amongst  us.  Employ  thy  valour,  O  Hero,  for  thou  are  most 
fitted  to  do  so.  Bestir  thyself  and  cross  the  vast  ocean,  O 
Redoubtable  Monkey;  the  entire  monkey  host  is  eager  to 
behold  thy  prowess.  Arise  and  leap  over  the  mighty  sea,  for 
thou  surpasseth  all  beings  in  motion.  Canst  thou  remain  in- 
different to  the  despair  of  all  the  monkeys  ?  Put  forth  thy 
strength,  as  did  Vishnu  when  traversing  the  Three  Worlds  with 
three  strides,  O  Lion  among  Monkeys  !  "

Hanuman  prepares  to  go  to  Lanka 

Seeing  that  extremely  agile  leader  of  monkeys  stretching  him- 
self in  preparation  for  crossing  the  four  hundred  miles  of  sea, 
the  monkeys,  renouncing  all  despondency,  were  filled  with 
delight  and  began  to  shout  and  praise  the  heroism  of  Hanuman. 

And,  struck  with  amazement,  beings  from  every  sphere  re- 
joiced unitedly,  even  as  when  they  beheld  the  Lord  Himself 
displaying  his  powers,  when  taking  the  three  strides. 

Thus  acclaimed,  the  mighty  Hanuman  expanded  in  size  and 
waved  his  tail  in  pleasure,  demonstrating  his  strength.  Ap- 
plauded by  the  older  monkeys  and  filled  with  energy,  he  assumed 
an  unparalleled  shape,  like  a  lion  that  stretches  himself  at  the 
mouth  of  a  rocky  cavern,  and  that  Son  of  Maruta  began  to 
yawn  and  the  mouth  of  that  intelligent  monkey  resembled  a 
blazing  brazier  or  a  smokeless  fire. 

Rising  in  the  midst  of  those  monkeys,  his  hair  standing  on  end 
for  joy,  he  paid  obeisance  to  the  older  leaders  and  said  to  them  : — 
"  I  am  the  son  of  him  who  shatters  the  mountain  peaks  and  is 
the  friend  of  fire,  the  mighty  and  incommensurable  Vayu,  who 
circulates  in  space,  Maruta,  of  impetuous  bounds,  rapid  pace 
and  great  soul.  A  thousand  times  am  I  able  without  pausing,  to 
encircle  Mem,  that  colossus  that  seems  to  lick  the  heavens. 
With  my  strong  arms,  churning  up  the  sea,  I  can  inundate  the 
world  with  its  mountains,  rivers  and  lakes ;  with  my  thighs  and 
legs,  I  can  cause  the  ocean,  the  abode  of  Varuna  with  its  great 
denizens,  to  overflow.  I  can  encircle  Vainateya,  revered  by  all, 
who  feeds  on  serpents,  a  thousand  times  while  he  courses  once 
through  space.  What  is  more,  I  am  able  to  reach  the  sun  which 
rises  in  glory  crowned  with  rays,  before  it  sinks  in  the  west  and 
return  without  touching  the  earth.  I  can  leap  beyond  the 
322 


KISHKINDHA    KANDA 

stars  and  planets,  suck  up  the  ocean  and  rive  the  earth ;  I  can 
shatter  the  mountains  with  my  bounds  and  in  the  immeasurable 
energy  of  my  leaping  I  can  cause  the  sea  to  overflow.  When  I 
mount  into  the  sky,  flowers  from  countless  shrubs  and  trees  will 
be  borne  away  by  me  on  my  aerial  course  this  day  and  studded 
with  flowers  my  path  shall  resemble  the  Milky  Way. 

"  And,  O  Monkeys,  all  beings  shall  behold  me  coursing 
through  the  air,  encompassing  the  firmament,  now  rising,  now 
descending,  as  it  were  devouring  space.  I  shall  scatter  the 
clouds,  shatter  the  mountains  and  dry  up  the  ocean  with  my 
constant  leaping.  My  powers  are  equal  to  the  eagle's  or  the 
wind ;  I  know  of  none  that  surpasses  the  King  of  the  Birds, 
the  Wind-god  or  myself.  In  the  twinkling  of  an  eye,  I  shall 
float  through  the  air  like  lightning  from  a  cloud.  While  crossing 
the  sea,  my  form  will  resemble  Vishnu's  taking  his  three  strides. 
My  heart  foretells  that  I  shall  encounter  Vaidehi,  therefore 
rejoice.  Equal  to  Maruta  in  motion  and  Garuda  in  speed,  I 
shall  cover  ten  thousand  miles ;  this  is  my  firm  conviction.  I 
am  able  to  wrest  the  *  amrita '  from  Indra,  armed  with  his  thunder- 
bolt or  from  Brahma  himself.  Be  assured,  that  having  turned 
Lanka  upside  down,  I  shall  return  !  " 

That  monkey  of  immeasurable  vigour  roared  thus,  and  astoun- 
ded, the  monkeys  gazed  on  him  with  joy ;  and  hearing  those  words 
that  dissipated  the  distress  of  his  kindred,  that  foremost  of 
monkeys,  Jambavan,  transported  with  delight,  said : — "  O  Hero  ! 
O  Son  ofKesarin!  O  Offspring  of  the  Wind !  Thou  hast  dispelled 
the  immense  anxiety  of  thy  fellows,  and  these  foremost  of 
monkeys  assembled  here  will  perform  acts  tending  to  thy 
welfare.  By  the  grace  of  the  Sages,  the  approval  of  our  elders 
and  the  blessing  of  our  spiritual  preceptors  do  thou  cross  the 
ocean.  We  will  stand  on  one  foot  awaiting  thy  return.  On 
thee  depend  the  lives  of  all  the  inhabitants  of  the  woods !  " 

Then  that  tiger  of  the  monkeys  said  to  those  rangers  of  the 
woods  : — "  None  in  this  world  will  be  able  to  sustain  the  force 
of  my  leaping.  Here  is  the  mountain  Mahendra  with  its  com* 
pact  mass  of  rocks  and  high  escarpments,  it  is  from  its  summit 
that  I  shall  spring.  With  its  trees  of  varied  fragrance  that 
cover  it  and  its  many  crags,  it  will  be  able  to  bear  my  weight, 
when  I  prepare  to  leap  over  four  hundred  miles."

THE  RAMAYANA  OF  VALMIKI 
With  these  words  that  monkey,  the  scourge  of  his  foes,  born 
of  Maruta,  whose  equal  he  was,  scaled  that  monarch  of 
mountains,  carpeted  with  flowers  of  every  kind  and  grassy 
swards  ranged  by  deer,  containing  flowering  creepers  and  trees 
laden  with  fruit  and  blossoms,  frequented  by  lions  and  tigers 
and  herds  of  intoxicated  elephants  maddened  with  ichor ; 
there  flocks  of  birds  trilled  and  waterfalls  tumbled  on  every  side. 

Ascending  that  mountain,  that  foremost  of  monkeys,  equal  to 
Mahendra  in  power,  began  to  wander  from  one  crest  to  another 
and  crushed  between  the  arms  of  that  high-souled  one,  that  great 
mountain  emitted  a  loud  clamour,  like  a  mighty  elephant  that 
has  been  attacked  by  a  lion  and  waters  gushed  out  from  the 
scattered  rocks  and  deer  and  elephants  were  seized  with  fear, 
whilst  the  giant  trees  shook. 

Its  spacious  uplands  were  deserted  by  the-pairs  of  Gandharvas 
engaged  in  drinking  and  dalliance,  the  birds  flew  away  and  the 
bands  of  Vidyadharas  fled  from  the  high  plateaus  ;  the  huge 
serpents  hid  themselves  in  terror  and  the  cliffs  and  spars  broke 
away.  With  its  serpents  hissing,  their  bodies  half  issuing  from 
their  holes,  the  mountain  shone,  as  if  decorated  by  pennants. 
The  Rishis  in  fear  and  agitation  fled  from  that  support  of  the 
earth  so  that  it  resembled  a  wayfarer  in  a  vast  forest,  deserted  by 
his  companions. 

And  that  agile  and  valiant  monkey,  endowed  with  great  speed, 
the  destroyer  of  his  foes,  filled  with  an  exalted  purpose,  had 
already  reached  Lanka  in  thought.

CHAPTER     I 

The  Departure  of  Hanuman 

Then  that  Scourge  of  His  Foes,  Hanuman,  prepared  to  follow 
the  path  of  the  Charanas1  in  quest  of  the  place  to  which  Sita 
had  been  borne  away  by  Ravana. 

Desirous  of  accomplishing  this  difficult  feat  without  hindrance, 
impossible  to  any  other,  that  powerful  monkey,  stretching 
out  his  head  and  neck  like  a  bull,  frightening  the  birds,  up- 
rooting the  trees  with  his  breast  and  destroying  innumerable 
creatures,  like  a  lion  overflowing  with  energy  joyfully  bounded 
over  the  grassy  slopes  resembling  the  sea. 

On  that  mountain  plateau,  frequented  by  the  Chiefs  of  the 
Serpent  Race,  embellished  by  blue,  red,  yellow,  rose  and  various 
coloured  metals,  thronged  with  Celestial  Beings,  Yakshas, 
Kinneras  and  Gandharvas,  able  to  change  their  form  at  will, 
that  foremost  of  monkeys  stood  like  a  Naga  in  a  lake. 

Then,  having  paid  homage  to  the  Sun-god,  Mahendra, 
Pavana,  Swyambhu  and  all  beings,  he  prepared  to  set  out  on  his 
journey.  Turning  towards  the  east  and  saluting  his  sire,  the 
resourceful  Hanuman,  having  resolved  to  cross  the  ocean  to  fulfil 
Rama's  purpose,  in  order  to  reach  the  southern  region,  expanded 
his  body  under  the  eyes  of  the  leaders  of  the  monkeys,  as  the 
sea  increases  under  the  full  moon. 

Assuming  an  immense  stature,  desirous  of  traversing  the 
ocean,  he  pressed  the  mountain  with  his  hands  and  feet  and  that 
immoveable  peak  shook  under  his  weight  and  all  the  blossom 
from  the  tops  of  the  trees  fell  in  a  shower  wholly  covering  it 
with  a  mass  of  fragrant  blooms. 

Under  the  extreme  pressure  of  that  monkey's  weight,  water 
gushed  forth  from  the  mountain  like  ichor  from  the  temples  of 
an  elephant  in  rut.    Trampled  underfoot  by  that  mighty  forest 


327 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

dweller,  the  mountain  let  loose  innumerable  streams  of  gold, 
silver  and  collyrium  and,  from  that  rocky  mass,  enormous 
boulders  detached  themselves  containing  red  arsenic  so  that  it 
resembled  a  brazier  wreathed  in  smoke. 

Crushed  on  every  side  by  the  monkey,  those  creatures, 
dwelling  in  the  caverns,  bruised  and  stifled,  emitted  strange  cries 
and  the  formidable  clamour  created  by  them  filled  the  whole 
earth  and  other  regions. 

Great  serpents,  rearing  their  distinctive  hoods,  vomited  fire 
and  bit  the  rocks  with  their  fangs  and  those  great  crags,  split 
by  the  venom,  broke  into  flames  and  were  shivered  into  a 
thousand  fragments.  The  medicinal  herbs  also,  which  grew 
there,  were  affected  by  the  poison  which  they  were  unable  to 
neutralise. 

Then  the  ascetics,  terrified,  reflecting  that  the  mountain  was 
being  riven  by  great  Beings,  fled  away,  as  well  as  the  Vidya- 
dharas  with  their  attendant  women.  Forsaking  their  golden 
seats,  goblets  and  precious  vessels  with  the  ewers  of  gold  in  the 
feasting  hall ;  abandoning  the  priceless  sauces,  wines  and  viands 
of  every  kind  and  the  bides  and  swords  with  guards  of  Kanaka 
gold ;  intoxicated,  their  necks  encircled  with  jewelled  chains, 
adorned  with  garlands  and  red  sandal  paste,  their  eyes  resembling 
blue  lotuses,  they  rose  into  the  air ;  and  those  fair  Ones, 
wearing  strings  of  pearls,  rings  and  bracelets,  startled,  ascended 
smiling  into  the  sky,  close  to  their  loved  ones. 

Witnessing  this  great  marvel,  Maharishis  and  Vidyadharas 
stood  in  the  firmament  gazing  down  on  the  mountain  and  they 
heard  those  pure-minded  ascetics  saying :  "  This  Hanuman, 
born  of  the  Wind,  endued  with  great  energy,  desirous  of  crossing 
the  ocean,  the  abode  of  Varuna,  in  order  to  carry  out  Rama's 
purpose  and  that  of  the  monkeys,  is  eager  to  reach  the  further 
shore,  a  most  difficult  feat." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  ascetics,  the  Vidyadharas  beheld  that 
foremost  of  monkeys  on  the  mountain,  bristling  and  quivering 
like  a  flame,  emitting  a  great  roar  like  the  rumble  of  thunder. 
Then  raising  his  tail  which  twitched  convulsively,  like  a  snake 
shaken  by  an  eagle,  he  waved  it  to  and  fro  and,  lying  curled 
across  his  back,  it  resembled  a  great  serpent  borne  away  by 
Garuda. 

328 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

And  that  monkey,  stiffening  his  arms  like  unto  two  immense 
clubs,  girded  up  his  limbs  and,  crouching  down,  contracted  his 
neck  and  arms,  summoning  up  all  his  strength  and  courage. 
Scanning  the  path  he  was  to  take  and  examining  the  distance  to 
be  covered,  he  drew  in  bis  breath,  pressing  his  two  feet  firmly 
on  the  ground  and  that  elephant  among  monkeys,  Hanuman, 
flattening  his  ears,  leapt  forward  and,  full  of  energy,  addressed 
the  forest  dwellers,  saying  : 

"  As  an  arrow  loosed  by  Raghava  flies  with  the  speed  of  the 
wind  so  shall  I  course  to  Lanka  which  is  guarded  by  Ravana. 
If  I  fail  to  find  the  daughter  of  Janaka  there,  I  shall  repair  with 
the  same  speed  to  the  region  of  the  Gods,  where,  if  despite 
mine  efforts  I  do  not  recover  Sita,  I  shall  bring  back  the  King  of 
the  Titans  in  chains.  Either,  achieving  success,  I  shall  return 
or  uprooting  Lanka  from  its  foundation,  I  shall  bear  it  hither, 
together  with  Ravana." 

With  these  words,  Hanuman,  the  foremost  of  monkeys, 
without  pausing  for  breath,  deeming  himself  to  be  a  second 
Suparna,  sprang  into  the  air  and,  such  was  the  force  of  his  leap, 
that  the  trees  growing  on  the  mountain,  tossing  their  branches, 
were  sent  spinning  on  every  side. 

In  his  rapid  flight,  Hanuman  bore  away  those  trees  with  their 
flowering  boughs  filled  with  lapwings  intoxicated  with  love, 
into  the  empyrean.  Carried  away  by  the  impetus  of  his  tre- 
mendous bound,  those  trees  followed  in  bis  wake,  like  relatives 
accompanying  their  dear  one  setting  out  on  a  journey  to  a  far 
country.  Uprooted  by  the  force  of  his  motion,  Sala  and  other 
forest  trees  followed  in  Hanuman's  wake,  like  an  army  its  leader. 
Surrounded  by  countless  trees,  the  crests  of  which  were  laden 
with  blossom,  the  monkey  Hanuman,  resembling  a  glorious 
mountain,  was  wonderful  to  behold.  And  those  great  trees, 
full  of  sap,  fell  into  the  sea,  as  formerly  the  mountains  in  fear  of 
Indra  plunged  into  Varuna's  abode. 

Covered  with  flowers  of  every  kind,  as  well  as  young  shoots 
and  buds,  that  monkey  shone  like  a  cloud  or  a  hill  aglow  with 
fireflies.  Torn  away  by  his  leaping,  those  trees,  scattering  their 
blossom  here  and  there,  plunged  into  the  sea,  like  friends  who, 
having  escorted  one  of  their  company,  return.  Borne  away  in 
their  fragility  by  the  wind  produced  by  the  monkey's  impetuous 
329 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

flight,  which  had  detached  them  from  their  stems,  the  multi- 
coloured flowers  fell  into  the  sea. 

Covered  with  a  drift  of  fragrant  blooms  of  diverse  tints,  that 
monkey,  in  his  flight,  resembled  a  mass  of  clouds  embellished  by 
lightning  and  the  waters  strewn  with  the  blossom  of  his  leap, 
looked  like  the  firmament  when  the  enchanting  stars  appear. 
His  two  arms  outstretched  in  space,  resembled  two  five-headed 
serpents  issuing  from  the  summit  of  a  mountain. 

Sometimes  that  mighty  monkey  seemed  to  be  drinking  up  the 
ocean  with  the  multitudinous  waves  and  sometimes  it  seemed  as 
if  he  would  swallow  the  sky  itself.  As  he  thus  followed  the 
wind's  path,  his  eyes,  shining  like  lightning,  sparkled  like  two 
fires  that  have  been  kindled  on  a  mountain. 

The  eyes  of  that  tawny-hued  one  resembled  the  sun  and  moon 
in  juxtaposition,  and  his  coppery  nose  lent  his  countenance  the 
same  hue  as  the  solar  orb  at  the  approach  of  dusk ;  his  uplifted 
tail  caused  that  offspring  of  the  wind  to  appear  like  the  raised 
banner  of  Indra.  With  his  coiled  tail  and  white  teeth,  that 
exceedingly  sagacious  son  of  Anila,  Hanuman,  shone  like  the 
star  of  day  encircled  by  a  halo  of  rays  and  his  plump  form,  of  a 
copper}'  hue,  caused  him  to  resemble  a  mountain  which  is  being 
excavated  for  its  deposits  of  red  ochre.  Bounding  over  the 
waters,  the  air  imprisoned  in  the  armpits  of  that  leonine  monkey, 
emitted  a  sound  like  thunder. 

As  in  space,  a  meteor  from  a  higher  region  rushes  through  the 
skies  so  did  that  elephant  of  monkeys  appear  or  like  a  great 
bird  soaring  into  the  air  or  a  great  tusker  tightly-bound  by  a 
girth,  whilst  the  reflection  of  his  body  cast  on  the  deep  resembled 
a  vessel  foundering  in  a  storm. 

Wherever  that  great  monkey  passed,  the  sea  rose  tumultuously 
under  the  force  of  his  bounds  and,  rushing  on  with  extreme 
speed,  with  his  breast  like  a  great  prow,  he  caused  the  salty  sea 
to  surge  mountainously.  Pushing  those  high  heaving  billows 
before  him,  that  lion  among  monkeys  seemed  to  be  separating 
heaven  and  earth ;  the  waves  that  rose  up  resembled  Mount 
Meru  and  Mandara  and,  breasted  by  him  in  his  impetuous 
course,  the  waters  lashed  by  bis  speed,  overspread  the  sky  like 
autumnal  clouds.  Whales,  crocodiles,  huge  fish  and  turtles 
were  uncovered  in  turn,  like  the  limbs  of  one  shedding  bis 
330 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

attire,  and  sea  serpents,  beholding  that  lion  among  monkeys 
travelling  through  space  took  him  to  be  Suparna  himself. 

The  shadow  of  that  great  monkey,  forty  miles  in  extent  and 
thirty  wide,  grew  larger  in  the  rapidity  of  his  flight  and,  re- 
sembling a  mass  of  white  clouds,  falling  on  the  salty  waters, 
looked  exceedingly  beautiful.  That  supremely  illustrious  and 
mighty  monkey  of  vast  body  appeared  like  a  winged  mountain 
as  he  followed  his  aerial  path  without  rest. 

Wherever  that  mighty  elephant  among  the  monkeys  passed, 
the  sea  was  instantly  transformed  into  a  fountain  and,  following 
the  path  of  the  birds,  Hanuman,  like  the  King  of  the  feathered 
tribe,  thrust  aside  the  massed  clouds  like  the  Wind-god 
himself.  Great  clouds,  red,  blue,  pate  or  dark,  scattered  by  the 
monkey's  flight,  looked  exceedingly  beautiful  and  he,  now 
entering  into  them,  sometimes  hidden  sometimes  visible, 
resembled  the  moon. 

Seeing  that  Plavaga1  coursing  with  such  speed,  the  Gods, 
Gandharvas  and  Danavas  began  to  rain  flowers  on  him  and, 
as  he  sailed  on,  the  sun  refrained  from  tormenting  him  and  the 
wind  ministered  to  him  for  the  sake  of  Rama's  enterprise. 

Then  the  Rishis  praised  that  dweller  of  the  woods  as  he  was 
coursing  through  the  sky  and  the  Gods  and  Gandharvas 
extolled  him  in  song.  Seeing  him  bounding  in  space,  Nagas, 
Yakshas  and  Rakshasas  of  various  races  lauded  that  excellent 
monkey  and  the  ocean,  ever  solicitous  for  the  honour  of  the 
House  of  Ikshwaku,  reflected  : — "  If  I  do  not  lend  assistance  to 
this  Lord  of  Monkeys,  I  shall  be  an  object  of  obloquy  to  all 
those  gifted  with  speech ;  was  I  not  reared  by  Sagara,  the 
foremost  of  the  race  of  Ikshwaku  ?  This  monkey  is  their 
counsellor,  it  is  therefore  incumbent  on  me  not  to  let  him  perish 
in  the  waves.  It  behoves  me  to  act  in  such  wise  that  he  may 
rest  and,  thus  relieved  by  me,  he  will  happily  traverse  the 
remaining  way." 

In  this  magnanimous  thought,  the  sea  addressed  that  most 
excellent  of  mountains,  the  golden-hued  Mainaka,  which  was 
covered  by  waves,  saying : — 

"  Thou  hast  been  placed  here  by  the  King  of  the  Celestials,  as 
a  rampart  against  trie  Asuras  inhabiting  the  nether  regions. 

1  Plavaga. — One  who  moves  by  leaps  and  bounds. 

331 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Their  power  is  well  known  and,  lest  they  rise  up  anew  from  that 
hell  of  immeasurable  dimensions,  thou  art  here  to  prevent  their 
escape.  Nevertheless  thou  art  able  to  move  upwards  and  down- 
wards and  from  side  to  side.  I  command  thee,  therefore,  O 
Best  of  Mountains,  to  rise  up.  That  lion  among  monkeys, 
performer  of  mighty  exploits,  engaged  in  Rama's  service,  over- 
come with  fatigue  is  passing  over  thee ;  thou  art  witness  of  his 
exertions,  now  lift  thyself  up  !  " 

Hearing  the  Ocean's  words,  the  golden-breasted  Mountain 
Mainaka  with  its  tall  trees  and  creepers,  instantly  rose  from  its 
watery  bed  and,  as  the  sun  with  its  burning  rays  divides  the 
cloud,  that  great  mountain,  which  the  waters  had  concealed,  on 
Sagara's  request,  exposed  its  golden  peaks  inhabited  by  Kinneras 
and  great  serpents,  shimmering  like  the  sun  at  dawn,  as  if  it 
were  licking  the  skies.  The  summits  of  that  high  mountain, 
shining  like  a  sword,  possessed  the  brilliance  of  gold  and  its 
gilded  crests  emitted  a  dazzling  light  lending  it  the  lustre  of  a 
thousand  suns. 

Beholding  that  mountain  suddenly  emerge  before  him  from 
the  middle  of  the  sea,  Hanuman  reflected  :  '  This  is  an  obstacle  ', 
and  that  mighty  and  impetuous  monkey  crushed  that  stony  mass 
with  his  breast  as  the  wind  scatters  the  clouds  ;  then  that  fore- 
most of  mountains,  recognizing  the  power  of  Hanuman,  shouted 
for  joy.  Thereupon,  assuming  the  form  of  a  man,  stationing 
himself  on  his  own  summit,  with  a  glad  heart  he  addressed 
Hanuman  saying : — 

"  O  Most  Excellent  of  Forest  Dwellers,  thou  hast  undertaken 
an  arduous  task,  take  thine  ease  on  my  crest  and  continue 
without  fatigue.  The  ocean  king  was  born  in  the  House  of 
Raghu  and,  seeing  thee  engaged  on  Rama's  behalf,  offers 
obeisance  to  thee.  To  render  service  for  service  is  the  divine 
decree.  Desirous  of  serving  Raghu's  race,  he  is  worthy  of  thy 
consideration.  To  do  thee  honour,  the  Sea  God  adjured  me 
thus : — 

"  *  Traversing  a  hundred  yojanas  through  the  air,  this  monkey 
is  worn  out  by  bis  exertions,  let  him  rest  awhile  on  thy  summit 
and  continue  his  way  without  fatigue.'  Do  thou  therefore  re- 
main here,  O  Best  of  Monkeys  and  repose  thyself.  Having 
feasted  on  these  many  sweet  and  fragrant  fruits  and  roots, 
332

proceed  on  thy  course  at  thy  leisure.  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys, 
the  sum  of  thy  virtues  is  well-known  in  the  Three  Worlds.  O 
Son  of  the  Wind,  of  all  the  Plavagas  who  abound  in  energy,  I 
esteem  thee  to  be  the  chief,  O  Lion  among  Monkeys  !  Even  an 
ordinary  man  is  honoured  as  a  guest  by  one  conversant  with  his 
duty,  how  much  more  one  such  as  thou  ?  Thou  art  the  Son  of 
Maruta,  the  Foremost  of  the  Celestials  and  dost  equal  him  in 
speed,  O  Best  of  Monkeys  !  In  honouring  thee,  who  art  con- 
versant with  virtue,  one  is  honouring  thy  sire,  therefore  thou 
dost  merit  my  reverence.  Hearken,  there  is  a  further  reason 
for  this : 

"  In  olden  times,  Dear  Child,  the  mountains,  endowed  with 
wings,  began  to  range  the  four  quarters  with  the  speed  of 
Garuda,  and  journeying  thus,  the  companies  of  Celestials, 
ascetics  and  other  Beings  trembled  with  fear  lest  they  should 
fall.  Then,  highly  enraged,  the  God  of  a  Thousand  Eyes,  the 
performer  of  an  hundred  sacrifices  severed  the  wings  of  those 
hundreds  and  thousands  of  mountains  with  his  thunderbolt. 

"  When,  full  of  wrath,  the  Lord  of  the  Celestials  approached 
me,  brandishing  his  mace,  I  was  suddenly  swept  away  by  that 
high-souled  Wind-god.  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  I  was  thus 
cast  into  the  salty  waves  and,  retaining  my  wings,  was  preserved 
unhurt  by  thine  ancestor.  On  account  of  this,  thou  art  an 
object  of  adoration  to  me  and  this  is  the  powerful  bond  which 
unites  us,  O  Chief  of  the  Monkeys.  The  time  for  honouring 
the  benefit  conferred  having  come,  it  behoves  thee  to  accord  this 
felicity  to  the  Ocean  and  myself,  O  Illustrious  One !  Repose 
thyself  therefore  and  accept  our  homage,  who  are  worthy  of  thy 
respect,  O  Venerable  Hanuman !    Happy  am  I  to  see  thee  here !  " 

Thus  accosted  by  Mainaka,  the  foremost  of  mountains,  that 
excellent  monkey  answered,  saying : — "  I  am  grateful  for  thy 
welcome  but  time  presses  and  I  have  vowed  not  to  rest  on  the 
way ;  day  is  declining,  let  nothing  disturb  thy  serenity." 

Then,  touching  the  mountain  with  his  hand,  that  lion  among 
monkeys,  smiling,  sailed  on  through  the  air,  whereupon  the 
mountain  and  the  ocean  offered  him  their  respect  and  gave  him 
their  blessings.  Rising  high  into  the  sky,  he  looked  down  on  the 
mountain  and  the  vast  ocean  and  proceeded  unsupported  in 
the  pathway  of  the  wind.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Seeing  Hanuman  achieve  this  difficult  feat,  the  Celestial 
Beings  and  the  ascetics  acclaimed  him ;  then  the  Gods  present, 
in  their  turn,  applauded  the  action  of  that  golden  mountain  of 
beautiful  slopes,  as  did  Indra,  the  Thousand-eyed  Deity  also, 
and  supremely  gratified,  the  consort  of  Sachi  paid  homage  to 
that  illustrious  mountain  personally,  saying : — 

"  O  Lord  of  Mountains,  I  am  extremely  pleased  with  thee ! 
I  grant  thee  full  security,  proceed  therefore  where  thou  desirest, 
O  Friend.  Thou  hast  fearlessly  offered  assistance  to  Hanuman, 
who  was  exhausted  after  crossing  four  hundred  miles  of  sea, 
despite  every  hazard.  It  is  on  Rama's  behalf,  the  Son  of  King 
Dasaratha,  that  the  monkey  has  undertaken  this  journey  and 
thou  hast  welcomed  him  to  the  best  of  thy  power,  I  am  well 
pleased  with  thee  !  " 

Beholding  the  King  of  the  Gods,  Shatakratu  highly  gratified, 
that  foremost  of  mountains  experienced  supreme  felicity  and 
having  received  that  boon  from  Indra,  resumed  its  former  place. 
Then  Hanuman,  in  a  short  space,  sped  over  the  sea. 

Thereupon  the  Gods,  Gandharvas  and  Siddhas  with  the 
ascetics  called  upon  Surasa,  the  Mother  of  Serpents,  who 
resembled  the  sun,  saying  : — 

"  The  effulgent  Son  of  the  Wind  is  crossing  the  main,  it  is 
for  thee  to  delay  him  awhile  Assuming  the  form  of  a  terrible 
Rakshasi,  as  high  as  a  mountain,  with  monstrous  jaws  and 
coppery  eyes,  do  thou  reach  up  to  the  sky.  We  desire  to  test  his 
strength  and  measure  his  fortitude  to  see  if  he  is  able  to  over- 
come thee  or  if  he  retires  discomfited." 

At  these  words,  Surasa,  having  been  honoured  by  the  Gods, 
rose  from  the  ocean  in  the  form  of  a  female  demon,  deformed  and 
hideous,  inspiring  terror  in  all  beings  and,  staying  Hanuman  in 
his  flight,  addressed  him  saying : — 

"  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  thou  hast  been  destined  by  the 
Lords  of  the  World  to  be  my  food,  I  am  about  to  devour  thee, 
do  thou  enter  my  mouth  !  This  boon  was  formerly  granted  to 
me  by  Dhatar." 

With  these  words  she  opened  her  vast  mouth  wide,  placing 
herself  in  Maruti's  path. 

Having  listened  to  Surasa's  speech,  Hanuman,  smiling, 
answered  her : — 

334 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

"  Rama,  the  Son  of  Dasaratha,  who  retired  to  the  Dandaka 
forest  with  Lakshmana  his  brother,  and  Vaidehi  his  consort, 
as  a  result  of  a  certain  exploit,  became  the  enemy  of  the  demons. 
His  beloved  wife,  the  illustrious  Sita  was  subsequently  carried 
away  by  Ravana.  I  have  been  sent  to  her  on  Rama's  behalf, 
to  whom  thou  shouldst  proffer  assistance,  O  Thou  who  in- 
habitest  his  dominion.  Having  found  Maithili  and  rejoined 
Rama,  whose  deeds  are  memorable,  I  shall  return  and  enter 
thy  mouth,  this  I  promise  thee  in  good  faith.** 

Thus  addressed  by  Hanuman,  Surasa,  who  was  able  to  change 
her  form  at  will,  answered  : — "  None  shall  pass  me  alive,  this  is 
the  boon  I  have  received."  Then  seeing  him  continue  on  his 
way,  the  Mother  of  Serpents  added : — "  I  have  received  this 
favour  from  Brahma,  first  enter  my  mouth  then  go  thy  way." 

Thereafter,  extending  her  capacious  jaws,  she  placed  herself 
in  front  of  Maruti.  Surasa's  words  incensed  that  lion  among 
monkeys  and  he  said : — 

"  Open  thy  mouth  wide  enough  to  swallow  me."  Having 
said  this  in  anger,  Surasa  extended  her  jaws  to  the  width  of  forty 
miles  and  Hanuman  increased  his  girth  accordingly ;  thereat 
Surasa  enlarged  her  mouth  to  fifty  miles,  and  seeing  the  jaws 
of  Surasa  wide  open  with  its  long  tongue,  terrible  to  look  upon, 
resembling  a  mountain,  measuring  fifty  miles,  Hanuman 
enlarged  himself  to  that  extent  also.  Then  Surasa  increased  her 
mouth  to  sixty  miles  and  the  heroic  Hanuman  to  seventy, 
whereupon  Surasa  widened  her  jaws  to  eighty  miles,  and 
Hanuman,  resembling  Fire1  itself,  to  ninety  miles.  Then 
Surasa  enlarged  her  mouth  to  the  extent  of  an  hundred  miles 
and  Hanuman,  reducing  his  body  like  a  cloud  to  the  size  of  a 
thumb's  breadth  entered  into  her  mouth  and,  re-emerging 
from  it,  standing  in  space,  addressed  her  saying : — 

"  O  Dakshayani,  salutations  to  thee,  I  have  entered  thy 
mouth,  now  I  go  to  seek  out  Vaidehi.  Thy  boon  has  been 
honoured  1" 

Seeing  Hanuman  emerging  from  her  mouth  like  the  moon 
from  the  mouth  of  Rahu,  that  goddess,  assuming  her  own  form, 
said  to  the  monkey : — 

"  Go,  O  Best  of  Monkeys  !  Accomplish  thy  mission.    Thou 

1  Lit. :    The  Fire-god. 

335 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 
hast  done  well,  O  Friend !   Now  restore  Sita  to  the  magnani- 
mous Raghava ! " 

Seeing  this  third  supremely  difficult  feat  accomplished  by 
Hanuman,  all  beings  extolled  that  monkey,  crying :  '  Excellent ! 
Excellent J '  paying  obeisance  to  him ;  and  he,  flying  into  the  sky, 
with  the  speed  of  Garuda,  went  on  across  the  sea,  the  abode  of 
Varuna,  coursing  through  the  air  which  was  filled  with  clouds, 
where  birds  ranged  and  which  was  frequented  by  Vidyadharas 
and  shining  vehicles  drawn  by  lions,  elephants,  tigers  and 
winged  serpents.  And  Maruti,  scattering  the  clouds  like  the 
wind  itself,  sailed  on  like  Garuda  through  that  firmament, 
which  was  illumined  by  flashes  of  lightning,  resembling  the  five 
fires,  inhabited  by  beings,  who,  by  their  merits  had  conquered 
heaven,  occupied  by  the  Deity  of  Fire  bearing  the  sacrificial 
oblations.  Adorned  by  the  constellations  of  planets,  the 
sun,  the  moon  and  hosts  of  stars ;  thronged  with  Maharishis, 
Gandharvas,  Nagas  and  Yakshas ;  pure,  stainless,  immense ; 
inhabited  by  Vishvavasu  ;  trodden  by  the  elephant  of  the  King 
of  the  Gods,  that  orbit  of  the  sun  and  the  moon,  the  canopy  of 
the  world,  stretched  by  Brahma  over  the  earth,  was  visited  by 
countless  heroes  and  aerial  beings. 

Mighty  clouds,  shining  with  the  tints  of  Kalaguru,1  red, 
yellow  and  black,  sparkled  with  brilliance  as  they  were  dispelled 
by  Hanuman  and  he,  penetrating  those  cloudy  battlements, 
emerged  once  more  as  the  moon  in  the  rainy  season  disappears 
and  re-appears  in  the  clouds.  Everywhere  the  son  of  Maruta 
could  be  seen  cleaving  the  air  like  the  King  of  the  Mountains 
furnished  with  wings. 

Seeing  him  sailing  through  space,  a  female  demon  of  immense 
size,  named  Singhika,  who  was  able  to  change  her  form  at  will, 
said  to  herself : — '  To-day,  after  a  long  time,  I  shall  be  able  to 
satisfy  my  hunger  !  That  great  creature  has  appeared  in  answer 
to  my  wish !  * 

Reflecting  thus  in  her  heart,  she  seized  Hanuman's  shadow, 
and  he,  feeling  it  held  fast,  thought :  *  My  power  has  suddenly 
been  dissipated  like  a  mighty  barque  which  is  retarded  in  its 
course  by  an  adverse  wind ! '  Then  looking  round  on  every 
side,  Hanuman  perceived  that  immense  being  rising  from  the 

1  Kalagu.ru — Agallochura :  A  species  of  sandal  paste. 

33« 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

salty  waves.  Seeing  that  monster,  the  Son  of  the  Wind-god, 
reflected  : — *  This  is  without  doubt  that  creature  of  wonderful 
form,  possessed  of  exceeding  power,  given  to  securing  its  prey 
by  means  of  theit  shadow,  vtto  ms  <&s&afeft&  \<o  \n£  ty  ti&fc 
monkey  king.'  Concluding  by  her  action  that  it  was  Singhika, 
that  sagacious  monkey  expanded  his  frame  to  gigantic  pro- 
portions so  that  he  resembled  a  mass  of  cloud  during  the 
rains. 

When  the  demon  saw  the  enlarged  body  of  that  mighty 
monkey,  she  extended  her  jaws  so  that  they  resembled  the  sky 
and  the  nether  regions  and,  roaring  like  thunder,  hurled  herself 
upon  him,  but  marking  the  proportions  of  her  mouth  and  the 
vulnerable  parts  of  her  body,  that  intelligent  monkey,  hard  as  a 
diamond,  contracting  his  limbs,  threw  himself  into  her 
jaws. 

And  the  Siddhas  and  Charanas  beheld  him  diving  into  her 
mouth,  disappearing  like  the  moon  devoured  by  Rami  at  the 
time  of  eclipse.  And  Hanuman,  with  his  sharp  nails  tore  the 
entrails  of  that  demon  and,  with  the  rapidity  of  thought,  emerged, 
having  slain  her  by  his  acuteness,  endurance  and  skill  and,  having 
overthrown  her,  began  to  expand  once  more.  Thereafter  that 
hero  among  monkeys  suddenly  regained  his  power,  whilst  Sing- 
hika,  deprived  of  life  by  him,  torn  asunder,  sank  into  the  waves, 
Swyambhu  having  created  him  for  her  destruction. 

Perceiving  Singhika  speedily  overcome  by  him,  all  the  beings 
who  range  the  skies  addressed  that  foremost  of  monkeys  saying : 
"  Tremendous  is  this  deed  that  thou  hast  performed  this  day  ! 
Mighty  was  this  monster  whom  thou  hast  slain.  O  Illustrious 
Monkey,  now  pursue  the  purpose  dear  to  thine  heart  without 
hindrance.  He,  who  like  thee,  possesses  the  four  attributes : 
fixity  of  purpose,  circumspection,  wisdom  and  ability,  does  not 
fail  in  his  enterprise  O  Indra  among  Monkeys !  " 

Honoured  by  those  whose  wishes  are  fulfilled,  as  he  merited 
to  be,  that  monkey  flew  into  the  sky  like  Garuda,  the  devourer 
of  serpents.  Then,  having  reached  the  further  shore,  Hanuman 
looking  round  on  every  side,  observed  countless  woods  a 
hundred  miles  distant  and,  as  he  went  on,  that  leader  of  forest 
dwellers  saw  an  island  adorned  with  trees  of  various  kinds  and 
thickets  belonging  to  the  Malaya  mountains ;  and  he  surveyed 
337 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  sea  and  the  lands  bordering  it  and  the  trees  growing  on  its 
shores  as  also  the  mouths  of  the  ocean's  consorts.1 

Gazing  down  on  his  own  body  which  resembled  a  great  cloud 
covering  the  sky  that  self-contained  monkey  reflected  :  "  Ob- 
serving mine  immense  stature  and  the  rapidity  of  my  flight  the 
demons  will  be  seized  with  curiosity  concerning  me." 

Thinking  thus,  in  his  great  prudence,  he  contracted  his  body, 
which  was  the  size  of  a  mountain  and  assumed  his  ordinary 
form  as  one  whose  wits  have  been  scattered  resumes  his  normal 
state.  Abandoning  his  gigantic  dimensions,  he  took  on  his 
native  form,  as  did  Vishnu,  the  depriver  of  Bali's  power,  when 
he  made  the  three  strides. 

Constantly  mindful  of  his  mission,  Hanuman,  who  was  able 
to  assume  various  graceful  forms,  having  crossed  the  sea,  a  feat 
not  to  be  accomplished  by  any  other,  reduced  his  body  to  its 
former  size. 

Thereafter  that  high-souled  One,  resembling  a  cloudy 
pavilion,  alighted  on  the  summit  of  the  glorious  mountain  Samva, 
of  many  splendid  peaks  which  was  covered  with  Ketaka, 
Uddalaka  and  Narikela  trees. 

Reaching  the  shore  of  the  sea,  the  monkey  beholding  Lanka 
on  the  top  of  the  foremost  of  mountains,  descended,  having 
assumed  his  native  form,  causing  agitation  among  the  deer  and 
birds. 

Through  his  valour  having  traversed  the  ocean  heaving  with 
waves  and  abounding  in  Danavas  and  Pannagas,  Hanuman, 
alighang  on  the  further  shore,  beheld  Lanka  which  resembled 
the  dry  of  Amaravati. 


CHAPTER     2 

Hanuman* s  Arrival  in  Lanka 

Having  crossed  the  unconquerable  sea,  that  mighty  monkey, 
standing  on  the  summit  of  the  Trikuta  Mountain,  surveyed 

1  Ocean's  Consorts:   Probably  eatuaries. 

338 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Lanka  and  that  ape  endowed  with  great  prowess  was  covered 
by  a  shower  of  blossom  that  fell  from  the  trees  on  every  side, 
nor  did  that  fortunate  monkey,  who  had  just  traversed  many 
hundreds  of  miles  of  sea  without  pausing  for  breath,  experience 
any  fatigue. 

'  I  am  able  to  journey  many  hundreds  of  miles,  what  then  is 
this  ocean  measuring  four  hundred  miles  only  ? '  Thus  think- 
ing, that  foremost  of  monkeys,  endowed  with  great  energy, 
turned  quickly  towards  Lanka,  having  crossed  the  mighty  ocean 
and  he  passed  between  green  fields  and  dense  thickets  fragrant 
with  the  scent  of  honey  and  traversed  the  mountainous  district 
covered  with  trees  and  blossoming  woods.  Stationing  himself 
there,  the  Son  of  the  Wind-god  beheld  forests  and  groves  and 
Lanka  itself  perched  on  the  summit  of  the  mountain. 

Sarala,  Karnikara,  Kharjura  trees  in  full  flower  with  the 
balmy  Priyala,  Muchulinda,  Kutaja,  Ketaka  and  Priyangu 
trees  heavy  with  scent ;  Nipa,  Saptachchada,  Asana,  Kovidara 
and  Karavira  trees  laden  with  buds  and  flowers,  whose  crests, 
waving  in  the  wind  abounded  with  birds,  were  seen  by  him  and 
ponds  filled  with  swans  and  waterfowl  and  carpeted  with  white 
and  blue  lotuses;  flower  gardens  with  ornamental  fountains 
and  marvellous  parks  planted  with  every  kind  of  tree  which 
yielded  fruit  and  flowers  in  every  season. 

Drawing  nearer  to  Lanka,  which  was  protected  by  Ravana, 
surrounded  by  a  moat  embellished  with  blue  and  white  lotuses, 
the  auspicious  Hanuraan  noted  that  a  strong  guard  had  been 
placed  round  it  since  Sita's  abduction;  and  demons  with  for- 
midable bows  ranged  it  on  every  side  and  that  great  and  mar- 
vellous city  was  encircled  by  a  golden  wall,  its  buildings  as  high 
as  mountains,  resembling  autumn  clouds. 

The  main  highways  were  lined  with  tall  white  buildings  with 
hundreds  of  turrets  decorated  with  flying  pennants  and  banners. 
Most  wonderful,  with  its  golden  archways  festooned  with  climb- 
ing plants,  the  city  of  Lanka  appeared  to  Hanuman  to  be  like 
the  city  of  the  Gods.  Built  on  the  summit  of  a  mountain,  with 
its  palaces  of  dazzling  white,  it  resembled  an  aerial  city.  Con- 
structed by  Vishwakarma  and  ruled  by  the  Lord  of  the  Titans 
himself,  it  seemed  to  that  monkey  to  be  suspended  in  the  sky 
with  its  ramparts  as  the  thighs,  the  stretches  of  water  and  woods, 
339  z 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  raiment,  Sbataghnis1  and  spears  the  hair,  the  terraces  the 
diadem,  Lanka  resembled  a  woman,  a  creation  of  Vishwakarma's 
thought. 

Reaching  the  northern  gate  resembling  Mount  Kailasha, 
which  seemed  to  cleave  the  skies  and  support  the  firmament 
with  its  splendid  lofty  towers  and,  observing  that  city  thronged 
with  ferocious  titans,  like  a  cavern  full  of  venomous  snakes, 
protected  by  the  ocean  and,  recollecting  that  terrible  adversary, 
Ravana,  the  monkey  reflected  : — 

*  Even  should  the  mighty  armed  Raghava  succeed  in  reaching 
this  dread  and  impregnable  city  protected  by  Ravana,  what 
could  he  do  ?  It  is  not  possible  to  enter  into  negotiations  with 
these  demons  nor  could  one  win  them  over  by  bribes  nor 
succeed  in  sowing  dissension  among  them  nor  overcome  them 
in  fight.  Among  the  monkeys,  only  four  have  power  to  reach 
this  place — Bali's  son,  Nila,  the  sagacious  Sugriva,  and  I.  But 
first  let  me  ascertain  if  Vaidehi  still  lives  or  no ;  after 
seeing  Janaka's  daughter,  I  shall  consider  these  matters 
further.' 

Then  that  elephant  among  monkeys,  stationed  on  the  summit 
of  the  mountain,  bethought  himself  how  he  could  discover  Sita, 
the  delight  of  Rama.  *  In  this  shape  I  shall  not  be  able  to  enter 
the  city  guarded  by  valiant  and  ferocious  demons  nor  outwit 
those  warriors  full  of  courage,  energy  and  prowess.  In  order 
to  find  Janaki,  I  must  enter  the  city  by  night  at  a  favourable 
moment,  in  a  form  which  will  not  attract  attention  so  that  I  may 
carry  through  this  great  enterprise.' 

Beholding  that  city,  inaccessible  even  to  the  Gods  and  Asuras, 
Hanuman,  sighing  deeply,  reflected  within  himself :  *  How  can 
I  succeed  in  finding  Maithili,  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  without 
being  discovered  by  the  perfidious  Ravana,  Lord  of  the  Demons  ? 
How  may  the  work  of  Rama,  who  is  cognisant  of  the  Self,  not  be 
brought  to  nought  ?  How  may  I  see  the  daughter  of  Janaka 
alone  and  in  secret  ?  Undertakings  fail  in  the  face  of  hindrances 
raised  by  time  and  place  or  through  the  fault  of  an  incompetent 
messenger,  as  darkness  is  dispelled  by  the  rising  sun.  When  it 
concerns  that  which  should  be  undertaken  or  avoided,  the  best 
laid  plans  may  come  to  nought  through  the  heedlessness  of  a 

1  See  Glossary  of  Weapon*. 

340 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

messenger  nor  do  they  appear  in  all  their  splendour ;  a  pre- 
sumptuous messenger  may  spoil  all ! 

*  How  shall  I  act  so  that  there  shall  be  no  incompetence  on 
my  part  ?  How  may  my  crossing  of  the  ocean  bear  fruit  ? 
If  I  am  discovered  by  the  demons,  the  project  which  the  sagaci- 
ous Rama  has  formed,  who  desires  the  destruction  of  Ravana, 
will  miscarry.  Even  if  I  assume  the  form  of  a  demon  I  cannot 
remain  here  long  without  being  discovered  by  them,  how  much 
less  in  some  other  shape.  Even  the  wind  is  not  able  to  circulate 
here  unrecognized,  I  deem.  Nothing  escapes  the  vigilance  of 
these  formidable  titans.  If  I  remain  here  in  my  native  form,  I 
shall  be  courting  disaster  and  the  purpose  of  my  master  will  be 
frustrated,  therefore,  reducing  my  size,  I  shall  enter  Lanka  as  a 
monkey  in  order  to  carry  through  Rama's  design.  Entering 
this  inaccessible  city  by  night,  I  shall  penetrate  into  every  dwell- 
ing in  order  to  find  Janaka's  daughter.' 

Having  thus  resolved,  Hanuman,  eager  to  find  Vaidehi, 
waited  for  the  sun  to  set. 

When  the  day's  orb  had  sunk  behind  the  Asta  Mountain, 
Maruii  reduced  his  body  to  the  size  of  a  cat,  extraordinary  to 
behold  and,  in  the  dusk,  the  mighty  Hanuman,  springing  up, 
entered  that  marvellous  city  traversed  by  wide  streets  with  rows 
of  houses  adorned  with  golden  pillars  and  balconies,  which 
lent  it  the  appearance  of  a  city  of  the  Gandharvas. 

Then  he  beheld  that  capital  containing  seven  and  eight  storied 
buildings  with  marble  floors  inlaid  with  golden  mosaic  and 
golden  archways,  lending  it  a  great  brilliance  and,  seeing  the 
unimaginable  splendour  of  Lanka,  in  his  eagerness  to  find 
Vaidehi,  he  experienced  both  sadness  and  delight. 

With  its  garlands  of  palaces  rivalling  each  other  in  whiteness 
and  the  arches  interlaced  with  gold  of  great  price,  that  magnifi- 
cent city  protected  by  Ravana  was  encircled  by  intrepid 
warriors  of  great  prowess. 

And  the  moon  at  its  full  with  its  flocks  of  stars  seemed  to  be 
ministering  to  Hanuman  and,  with  its  myriad  rays,  filled  the 
worlds  with  its  light.  Then  that  hero  among  monkeys  gazed 
on  the  moon  shining  like  a  conch-shell,  white  as  milk  or  a  lotus 
stalk  that,  floating  all  luminous  in  space,  resembled  a  swan 
swimming  on  a  lake.

CHAPTER     3 

Hanuman  enters  the  City 

Having  rested  on  Mount  Samva  of  lofty  summits,  that  resembled 
a  great  cloud,  Hanuman,  the  son  of  Maruta,  that  lion  among 
monkeys,  confident  of  his  own  strength,  entered  Lanka  by  night, 
with  its  wealth  of  ravishing  groves  and  waters,  guarded  by 
Ravana ;  that  enchanting  city  with  its  dazzling  palaces  re- 
sembling  autumn  clouds,  where  the  sound  of  the  sea  could  be 
heard,  the  breezes  of  which  it  inhaled  day  and  night. 

Prosperous,  surrounded  by  great  forces,  resembling  Vitapavati 
with  its  white  gates  and  decorated  arches,  protected  by  infuri- 
ated elephants,  splendid  as  Bhogavati  filled  with  huge  serpents, 
similar  to  the  city  of  Indra,  embellished  by  hosts  of  stars, 
resounding  to  the  clamour  of  blustering  winds,  encircled  by  a 
golden  rampart,  re-echoing  to  the  pealing  of  innumerable  bells 
and  adorned  with  banners,  that  city  was  approached  by  Hanuman 
in  exaltation,  his  heart  full  of  wonder. 

And  he  surveyed  it  on  every  side,  with  its  golden  gates,  the 
lintels  of  emerald  and  the  pavements  studded  with  pearls, 
crystal  and  gems ;  with  its  steps  inlaid  with  precious  stones,  and 
floors  of  lapis  lazuli,  the  grilles  of  refined  gold  and  parapets  of 
silver ;  the  stairways  of  crystal  that,  free  from  dust,  were 
possessed  of  emerald  treads.  And  there  were  charming  rooms, 
which,  on  account  of  their  elegance,  seemed  to  be  built  in  the  air. 

The  cries  of  curlews  and  peacocks  could  be  heard  and  geese 
frequented  that  place  whilst  swans  floated  majestically  on  the 
lakes ;  everywhere  the  sound  of  the  beating  of  drums  and  the 
tinkling  of  ornaments  resounded  and,  beholding  Lanka  that 
resembled  Vasvakara  and  seemed  to  be  built  in  space,  the 
monkey  was  filled  with  rapture. 

Gazing  on  that  splendid  city  belonging  to  the  Lord  of  the 
Titans,  that  no  other  surpassed  in  opulence,  the  sagacious 
Hanuman  reflected : — *  This  capital,  protected  by  Ravana's 
warriors  is  not  to  be  subdued  by  force  and  is  only  accessible 
to  Kumuda,  Angada  and  that  mighty  monkey,  Sushena  or 
342 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Mainda  and  Dvivida  or  the  offspring  of  Vivaswata  or  the 
monkey  Kushaparva  or  Rikshya,  that  foremost  of  monkeys,  or 
myself/ 

Thereafter,  recollecting  the  valour  of  the  long-armed  Raghava 
and  the  prowess  of  Lakshmana,  the  confidence  of  that  monkey 
was  restored. 

And  that  mighty  monkey  surveyed  Lanka,  the  capital  of  the 
Lord  of  the  Titans,  that  had  the  sea  as  her  raiment,  cow  sheds 
and  stables  for  her  pendants,  the  armouries  her  breasts,  decked 
out  like  a  woman,  where  darkness  was  dispelled  by  the  bright 
light  of  torches  and  the  gleaming  of  the  stars. 

And  as  that  tiger  among  monkeys,  son  of  the  great  Wind-god, 
entered  the  city,  the  Deity  who  presided  over  the  capital  pro- 
tected by  Ravana,  she  of  monstrous  aspect,  rose  up  and  barred 
the  way  of  that  heroic  son  of  Vayu.  Emitting  a  great  roar,  she 
challenged  the  offspring  of  the  Wind-god,  saying : — 

"  O  Dweller  of  the  Forest,  who  art  thou  and  for  what  purpose 
hast  thou  come  hither  ?  Answer  truthfully  if  thou  dost  value 
thy  life !  Under  no  pretext  wilt  thou  be  able  to  obtain  entry 
into  this  Lanka  protected  by  the  forces  of  Ravana,  which  patrol 
it  on  every  side." 

Then  the  valiant  Hanuman  answered  her,  who  stood  before 
him,  saying : — '*  I  shall  tell  thee  ail  about  that  on  which  thou 
questioned  me  anon  but  say  first  who  thou  art  in  this  hideous 
form  and  why  thou  dost  admonish  me  in  anger,  O  Irascible 
One." 

Hearing  Hanuman's  words,  the  Goddess  of  Lanka,  able  to 
change  her  shape  at  will,  waxed  wrath  and  in  harsh  tones 
addressed  the  son  of  the  Wind-god,  saying : — 

"  Obedient  to  the  mandate  of  the  magnanimous  Ravana,  the 
King  of  the  Titans,  I  guard  the  city.  None  may  pass  me,  yet 
if  any  should  contrive  to  enter  here,  he  will  soon  fall  under  my 
blows,  deprived  of  his  life  breaths.  I  am  the  city  of  Lanka 
itself,  and  whatever  betide  I  shall  remain  true  to  the  words  I 
have  uttered ! " 

Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta,  the  foremost  of  monkeys,  stood 
motionless  like  a  rock  and  beholding  her  in  the  form  of  a  woman, 
that  lion  among  monkeys,  endowed  with  intelligence  and  courage, 
spoke  to  her  thus : — 

343 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  I  wish  to  behold  this  city  with  its  turrets,  walls  and  arches, 
and  have  come  hither  for  this  purpose.  Great  is  my  desire  to 
see  it  and  explore  its  woods,  groves  and  gardens,  as  also  its 
great  buildings." 

Hearing  these  words,  the  presiding  Deity  of  Lanka,  who  was 
able  to  change  her  form  at  will,  was  still  further  provoked 
and  answered  in  anger  : — 

"  O  Insensate  One,  O  Last  of  the  Monkeys  !  without  over- 
coming me,  thou  canst  not  behold  this  city  to-day,  which  is 
ruled  over  by  the  King  of  the  Titans." 

Then  that  lion  among  forest  dwellers  replied  to  that  female 
ranger  of  the  night,  saying : — "  After  viewing  the  city,  O 
Auspicious  One,  I  shall  return  from  whence  I  came." 

On  this,  Lanka  emitted  a  terrible  cry  and  struck  that  excellent 
monkey  with  the  palm  of  her  hand.  Under  the  force  of  her 
blow,  the  valiant  Son  of  Maruta  let  out  a  roar  and  closing  the 
fingers  of  his  left  hand,  pushed  her  away  with  his  fist.  Reflect- 
ing '  She  is  a  woman  '  he  controlled  his  anger,  nevertheless  the 
demon  fell  to  the  ground  instantly,  her  face  distorted  and,  seeing 
her  lying  on  the  earth,  Hanuman,  who  was  full  of  courage  and 
nobility,  had  compassion  on  her,  she  being  but  a  woman. 

Thereupon,  Lanka,  exceedingly  agitated,  addressed  that 
monkey  in  low  and  faltering  accents,  saying : — 

"  O  Mighty-armed  One,  have  pity  on  me !  Spare  me,  O 
Best  of  Monkeys  !  Those  endowed  with  strength  and  prowess, 
stay  their  hand  betimes !  O  Thou  of  great  might,  thou  hast 
overcome  me  by  thy  valour  !  Hear  the  following  truth  from  me 
which  was  proclaimed  by  Swyambhu  who  prophesied  saying : 
'  In  the  hour  that  a  monkey  overcomes  thee  by  force,  the  titans 
will  cease  to  be  invincible.' 

"  That  time,  fixed  by  Swyambhu  has  come,  as  is  shown  by 
thy  presence  here  to-day !  The  truth  ordained  by  the  Self- 
create  is  unalterable.  The  destruction  of  the  unrighteous  King 
Ravana  together  with  all  the  titans  is  imminent,  in  consequence 
of  the  abduction  of  Sita.  Therefore,  O  Best  of  Monkeys,  do 
thou  enter  this  city,  which  is  protected  by  Ravana,  and  accom- 
plish all  thou  desirest.  Entering  this  splendid  city,  protected  by 
the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  which  is  doomed,  go  about  freely  where- 
soever thou  wilt,  in  search  of  the  chaste  daughter  of  Janaka."

CHAPTER     4 

Hanuman  observes  the  City  and  its  Inhabitants 

By  his  valour,  the  mighty  Hanuman,  foremost  of  monkeys, 
having  triumphed  over  Lanka,  that  splendid  city,  able  to  change 
her  form  at  will,  without  passing  through  the  gate,  leapt  over  the 
wall  and,  by  night,  penetrated  into  the  centre  of  the  capital. 

Hanuman,  faithful  to  the  interests  of  the  King  of  the  Monkeys, 
having  found  his  way  into  that  city,  thus  placed  his  left  foot  on 
the  heads  of  his  foes  ;'  and  that  excellent  son  of  Maruta, 
entering  by  night,  proceeded  along  the  royal  highway  strewn 
with  flowers  and  continued  to  advance  through  that  enchanting 
capital  where  the  sound  of  musical  instruments  blended  with 
laughter. 

That  magnificent  city  with  its  innumerable  dwellings  bearing 
the  mark  of  the  mace  and  the  goad,  with  windows  of  diamond, 
resembled  the  sky  adorned  with  clouds.  Lanka  belonging  to 
the  titans,  with  its  opulent  mansions  like  white  clouds,  adorned 
with  lotuses  and  swastikas,  hung  with  garlands,  highly  decorated, 
was  viewed  by  Hanuman  with  delight,  who  ranged  it  on  Rama's 
behalf  and  in  the  interests  of  Sugriva. 

That  illustrious  monkey  passing  from  house  to  house, 
observed  the  many  dwellings  of  varying  forms,  on  every  side  and 
listened  to  the  melodious  chanting  in  triple  modulation,  of  women 
sick  with  love,  who  resembled  celestial  nymphs.  He  heard  the 
tinkling  of  their  girdles  and  the  clashing  of  their  anklets,  as 
they  ascended  the  stairways  of  those  dwellings  belonging  to  the 
great  Ones,  and  here  and  there  the  sound  of  clapping  of  hands 
and  the  clicking  of  castanets.  He  heard  also  the  intoning  of 
sacred  formulas  in  the  dwellings  of  the  titans  and  the  recitation 
of  those  occupied  in  the  study  of  the  Veda. 

He  also  saw  titans  who  were  singing  the  praises  of  Ravana  in  a 
loud  voice,  a  great  company  of  them  being  stationed  on  the 
royal  highway  which  they  obstructed ;    and  he  observed  a  large

concourse  of  spies  in  the  central  courtyard,  who  had  been 
initiated,  some  with  matted  locks,  some  shaven,  some  wearing 
deerskins  and  some  stark  naked,  bearing  handfuls  of  darbha 
grass,  braziers,  picks,  clubs  and  staves,  and  others  in  rags,  who 
had  only  a  single  eye  or  ear  or  breast  which  twitched  ;  and  some 
were  dwarfs,  hideous  to  behold ;  and  there  were  bowmen, 
swordsmen  and  warriors  bearing  clubs  and  iron  bars  or  efful- 
gent in  curious  armour ;  some  were  neither  exceedingly  fat  nor 
too  lean  nor  unduly  tall  nor  short  nor  extremely  fair  nor  dark 
nor  humpbacked  nor  dwarfed ;  some  were  deformed,  some 
handsome,  some  distinguished  and  there  were  also  standard 
bearers  and  some  who  carried  flags  and  every  kind  of  weapon. 

And  Hanuman  observed  that  some  were  armed  with  spears, 
darts,  harpoons,  arrows,  slings  and  other  weapons  and  many 
ranging  about  at  will  wore  garlands  and  were  daubed  with 
paste,  sprinkled  with  perfume,  clothed  in  rich  stuffs  and 
adorned  with  magnificent  jewels ;  some  of  these  mighty  warriors 
were  furnished  with  javelins  and  maces  and  hundreds  and 
thousands  of  them  were  garrisoned  in  the  central  courtyard, 
engaged  in  guarding  the  private  apartments  with  vigilance  by 
order  of  their  king. 

And  he  saw  the  famous  palace  of  the  Lord  of  the  Titans, 
built  on  the  summit  of  the  mountain,  with  golden  arched  gate- 
ways, surrounded  by  a  moat,  embellished  with  pale  lotuses  and 
completely  encircled  by  a  rampart,  resembling  heaven  itself; 
and  it  was  marvellous,  resonant  with  pleasant  sounds  and  filled 
with  the  neighing  of  superb  steeds  and  well-bred  beasts  and 
the  noise  of  chariots  and  elephants;  and  there  were  four  tusked 
elephants  resembling  great  clouds  and  many  herds  of  deer. 

Then  the  monkey  entered  that  palace  protected  by  the  Titan 
King,  guarded  by  thousands  of  mighty  Yatudhanas,  the  portals 
of  which  were  richly  decorated  with  beasts  and  birds  and  he 
penetrated  to  the  inner  apartment  encircled  with  walls  of 
Hema  and  Jambunada  gold,  its  ceilings  adorned  with  pearls 
and  gems  of  great  price  and  pervaded  by  the  fragrance  of  aloe 
and  sandalwood.

CHAPTER     5 

Hanuman  ranges  the  City  without  finding  Sita 

Then  the  fortunate  Hanuman  beheld  that  brilliant  orb  of  the 
night  in  the  midst  of  the  stars  covering  all  beings  with  its  light, 
like  a  bull  inflamed  with  desire  in  the  midst  of  a  herd  of  cows, 
and  that  heroic  monkey  gazed  on  that  moon,  floating  in  the  sky, 
white  as  the  sheen  of  a  conch  or  a  lotus  stalk,  that  star  of  cool- 
ing rays  which  destroys  the  sorrows  of  the  world,  draws  up  the 
tides  and  sheds  its  light  on  all  beings.  That  brightness 
which  shines  on  the  summit  of  Mount  Mandara  and  at  dusk 
sparkles  on  the  sea,  as  well  as  on  the  lotuses  of  the  lakes,  now 
blazed  from  the  face  of  that  nocturnal  planet. 

Like  a  swan  on  its  silvery  nest  or  a  lion  in  a  cave  of  the  Mandara 
Mountain  or  a  warrior  on  a  proud  elephant  so  was  the  splendour 
of  the  moon  in  the  heavens.  Like  a  humpbacked  buffalo  with 
pointed  horns  or  the  lofty  Mountain  Shveta  with  its  high  peaks 
or  an  elephant  with  gold-encircled  tusks,  so  did  the  moon  appear 
with  its  clearly  defined  prominence. 

Just  as  the  great  orb  of  the  sun  dissolves  the  ice  and  frost  on 
muddy  pools  so  was  darkness  dispelled  by  the  brilliance  of  the 
auspicious  moon,  whose  symbol  is  the  hare,  so  that  even  the  dark 
patches  on  its  surface  appeared  bright.  Like  the  King  of 
Beasts  issuing  from  his  cave  or  the  lord  of  elephants  entering  the 
deep  woods  or  a  sovereign  of  men  ranging  his  dominions  so  did 
the  moon  appear  in  its  full  splendour. 

The  brightness  of  its  rising  had  dispelled  the  night,  accentuat- 
ing the  swarthiness  of  the  titans,  those  eaters  of  flesh,  and 
awakening  thoughts  of  love  in  the  lover. 

Women,  whose  melodious  voices  had  charmed  the  ear,  having 
disported  themselves,  now  slept  in  the  arms  of  their  lords, 
whilst  titans  of  strange  and  terrible  deeds  went  forth  marauding. 

And  the  sagacious  Hanuman  beheld  mansions  where  intoxica- 
tion and  folly  reigned,  where  chariots,  horses  and  golden  seats 
were  seen  everywhere  in  luxurious  and  warlike  abundance  . 

He  beheld  titans  in  violent  debate,  raising  their  great  arms, 
discoursing  wildly,  railing  at  each  other  and  exchanging 
347 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

acrimonious  words ;  and  some  were  striking  their  breasts  and 
brandishing  great  bows,  whilst  others  adjusted  their  attire  or 
embraced  their  consorts. 

And  Hanuman  observed  courtesans  performing  their  toilet, 
whilst  others  slept  and  incomparably  lovely  women  laughing 
or  frowning  in  anger.  Here  gigantic  elephants  trumpeted, 
there  worship  was  being  performed,  whilst  warriors  were  utter- 
ing threats,  so  that  the  city  resembled  a  lake  filled  with  angry 
serpents. 

And  he  beheld  in  that  place,  persons  full  of  intelligence,  able 
debators,  pious  men,  leaders  of  fashion  and  observers  of  ritual, 
and  beholding  those  magnificent  beings,  endowed  with  every 
attribute  in  accord  with  their  nature,  Hanuman  was  delighted  ; 
such  was  their  splendour,  that  even  those  who  were  ugly, 
appeared  fair. 

And  he  saw  their  consorts,  full  of  nobility  and  of  great  beauty, 
worthy  of  adornment,  like  unto  stars  in  the  excellence  of  their 
conduct,  who  were  filled  with  affection  for  their  protectors, 
some  casting  tender  glances,  others  exchanging  tokens  and  some 
drinking. 

And  by  night,  Hanuman  observed  lovely  women  being  em- 
braced by  their  paramours,  affecting  modesty  or  passion,  like 
birds  sporting  with  their  mates,  whilst  others,  in  their  homes, 
lay  peacefully  on  the  breasts  of  their  lords,  full  of  tenderness, 
and  faithful  to  their  conjugal  duty. 

Some,  lying  without  raiment,  deserted  by  their  lovers,  had 
the  radiance  of  gold  and  were  marvellously  beautiful  with  their 
golden  skins,  graceful  limbs  and  complexions  like  the  moonlight. 

And  Hanuman  saw  other  women  in  their  homes  experiencing 
the  height  of  joy  with  their  lords,  full  of  delight,  decked  with 
flowers,  charming  the  hearts  of  their  consorts  with  their  beauty. 
These  lovely  women  of  radiant  countenance,  resembling  the 
moon,  possessing  marvellous  eyes  with  sweeping  lashes  and  slant- 
ing lids  and  adorned  with  innumerable  jewels,  seemed  to 
Hanuman  to  resemble  flashes  of  lightning. 

But  of  the  nobly-born  Sita,  offspring  of  a  royal  House,  fixed 

in  the  path  of  virtue,  resembling  a  delicate  flowering  creeper  or 

the  frail  Sadhujata  plant,  sprung  from  the  mind  of  Brahma 

Himself,  he  could  find  no  trace.    Sita,  established  in  the  path 

34» 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

of  chastity,  her  gaze  ever  fixed  on  Rama,  ever  absorbed  in  his 
contemplation,  his  very  mind  and  heart  itself,  exalted  above  all 
women,  a  prey  to  burning  grief,  her  bosom  wet  with  tears, 
she  who  was  formerly  adorned  with  priceless  ornaments,  Sita 
with  her  charming  lashes  and  enchanting  throat,  resembling  a 
blue-necked  peahen  disporting  itself  in  the  woods,  or  the  blurred 
outline  of  the  moon  or  a  golden  ingot  covered  with  dust  or  a 
scar  left  by  a  wound  or  a  golden  arrow  snapped  by  the  wind. 

And  that  monkey,  after  his  long  search,  not  finding  Sita, 
consort  of  that  lord  of  men,  Rama,  the  foremost  of  those  skilled 
in  speech,  was  overcome  with  grief  and  bereft  of  all  courage. 

CHAPTER     6 

Hanuman  explores  Ravana's  Palace 

Wandering  here  and  there  at  will  on  the  roofs  of  the  houses, 
that  monkey,  able  to  assume  any  form  he  chose,  ranged  the  city 
of  Lanka,  and  that  auspicious  one  came  to  the  abode  of  that 
Lord  of  the  Titans,  encircled  by  a  shining  wall,  sparkling  like  the 
sun  and  guarded  by  terrible  demons,  as  is  a  mighty  forest  by 
lions. 

And  that  foremost  of  monkeys  beheld  that  marvellous  palace 
with  its  fretted  archways,  inlaid  with  silver  and  embellished  with 
gold,  abounding  in  splendid  courts  and  gateways,  filled  with  the 
drivers  of  elephants  and  indomitable  warriors,  irresistibly 
swift  horses  harnessed  to  chariots  and  curious  waggons,  covered 
with  lion  and  tiger  skins,  that  were  embossed  with  images  of 
gold  and  silver  and  hung  with  jingling  bells. 

Strewn  with  precious  stones  and  furnished  with  rich  seats, 
this  was  the  favourite  haunt  of  the  Maharathas  and  their  meeting 
place.  Rare  deer  and  birds  of  every  species  and  variety  abounded 
here,  whilst  disciplined  sentries  protected  it.  Everywhere 
noble  and  distinguished  women  could  be  seen  and  the  palace 
was  filled  with  the  tinkling  of  their  ornaments  ;  there  the  fore- 
most of  the  titans  dwelt  and  it  was  decorated  with  royal  symbols 
and  fragrant  with  sandalwood.  Crowded  with  great  beings,  like 
a  forest  filled  with  lions,  resounding  to  the  bearing  of  gongs, 
349 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

tambourines  and  the  blare  of  conches,  it  was  also  the  place  of 
worship  of  the  titans,  where  offerings  were  made  at  the  times  of 
the  moon's  change ;  sometimes,  in  fear  of  Ravana,  silent  as  the 
sea  and  sometimes  resounding  like  the  waves,  that  vast  abode 
belonging  to  the  mighty  Ravana  was  strewn  with  precious  gems, 
and  that  great  monkey  beheld  it  blazing  in.  splendour  and  filled 
with  elephants,  horses  and  chariots. 

'  It  is  the  jewel  of  Lanka '  reflected  that  illustrious  monkey, 
Hanuman,  wandering  about  the  outskirts  of  the  palace  and  he 
began  to  range  the  dwellings  of  the  titans  and  their  gardens, 
and  he  bounded  into  the  abode  of  Prahasta  and  then  plunged 
courageously  into  the  palace  of  Mahaparshwa ;  thereafter,  that 
mighty  monkey  entered  the  residence  of  Kumbhakarna  which 
resembled  a  mass  of  cloud's  and  also  that  of  Bibishana ;  then 
in  turn  he  visited  the  dwellings  of  Mahodara,  Virupaksha, 
Vidyujjibha  and  Vidyunmala  and  with  a  bound  he  entered  the 
house  of  Vahudanshtra  and  that  of  Suka  and  the  intelligent 
Sarana.  Then  the  mansions  of  Indrajit,  Jambumala  and  Sumala 
were  explored  by  that  foremost  of  monkeys  and  thereafter  he 
passed  on  to  the  abodes  of  Rashmiketu,  Suryasachu  and  Vajra- 
kaya ;  and  next  the  offspring  of  the  Wind-god  searched  the 
habitations  of  Dhumraksha,  Sampati,  the  grim  Vidyudruna, 
Phana,  Vighana  and  Sukanabha,  Shakra,  Shatha,  Kapatha, 
Hrasvakarna,  Danshtra  and  the  demon  Lomasa,  Yudhyonmatta, 
Matta  and  the  horseman,  Dhwajagriva,  Sadin,  Vidyujjibha  and 
Vijibha,  as  also  that  of  Hastimukha  and  of  Karala,  Vishala  and 
Sonitaksha.  The  illustrious  Son  of  Maruta  then  searched  the 
dwellings  of  other  prosperous  titans  one  after  the  other,  marking 
their  affluence. 

And  having  searched  all  the  residences  belonging  to  those 
titans  in  every  way,  that  fortunate  monkey  approached  the  palace 
of  the  king.  Then  the  foremost  of  monkeys  observed  demon 
women  of  menacing  looks,  prowling  outside  the  apartments 
where  Ravana  slept,  bearing  darts  and  maces  in  their  hands  and 
equipped  with  spears  and  clubs  and  he  beheld  innumerable 
bands  of  them  in  the  abode  of  the  titan  king  and  gigantic 
demons  brandishing  weapons  of  every  kind.  He  beheld  steeds 
of  exceeding  swiftness,  red,  white  and  black  and  wonderfully 
bred  elephants,  vanquishers  of  hostile  tuskers,  trained  for  every 
350 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

suitable  purpose  and  equal  to  Airavata  himself  in  conflict  and 

these  elephants,  the  destroyers  of  hostile  armies  resembled 
scurrying  clouds  or  moving  hills  and  their  trumpeting  was  like 
the  crash  of  thunder. 

Then  that  monkey,  the  son  of  the  Wind-god,  beheld  thousands 
of  the  titan  host  in  that  palace  and  cars  of  gold  and  glittering 
mail  which  shone  like  the  rising  sun ;  he  saw  also  many  litters 
of  different  shapes,  and  bowers,  picture  galleries,  gymnasiums, 
mountains  constructed  of  wood,  pavilions  and  entertainment 
halls.  And  in  that  palace  belonging  to  Ravana,  was  a  charm- 
ing edifice  as  beautiful  as  the  Mandara  Mountain  and  pens  for 
peacocks  and  banners  and  flagpoles.  Heaps  of  jewels  lay  about 
and  a  great  accumulation  of  treasure  had  been  brought  there  by 
the  exploits  of  those  valiant  titans  so  that  it  resembled  the  palace 
of  Kuvera.  On  account  of  the  lustre  of  those  gems  and  the 
resplendence  of  Ravana  himself,  that  palace  glittered  like  the  sun 
with  its  myriad  rays. 

And  that  monkey  chief  beheld  couches  and  seats  of  gold,  and 
vessels  wrought  with  pearls  overflowing  with  wines.1  and  the 
dimensions  and  magnificence  of  that  place  caused  it  to  resemble 
the  mansion  of  Kama  or  the  abode  of  Kuvera,  and  that  palace 
resounded  with  the  tinkling  of  anklets  and  girdles,  with  drums 
and  cymbals  and  other  musical  instruments  and  was  thronged 
with  women  as  lovely  as  pearls  and  surrounded  by  great 
ramparts.

Then  that  mighty  monkey  continued  to  explore  those  dwellings 
fitted  with  golden  windows,  studded  with  emeralds,  resembling 
a  mass  of  clouds  in  the  rainy  season  rent  by  Ughtning  and  tra- 
versed by  flocks  of  cranes.    And  he  beheld  various  halls  and 

1  Overflowing  with  Wines — Lit.  :  Madha  and  Asava— spiritous  liquor* 
made  of  honey,  molasses  or  the  blossom  of  Bassia  Caryola,  or  according  to 
some,  grapes. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

buildings  stored  with  conches,  bows  and  weapons  of  war, 
furnished  with  turrets  as  high  as  hills,  and  these  mansions,  con- 
taining treasure  of  every  kind  were  held  in  regard  by  both  Gods 
and  titans  and  were  flawless  and  constructed  by  Havana  by  his 
own  power. 

Hanuman  having  scoured  the  mansions  of  that  Lord  of  Lanka 
meticulously  furnished  with  every  comfort  as  if  Maya  had 
created  them,  thereafter  visited  the  palace  of  that  King  of 
Rakshasas  himself,  which  surpassed  all  others  and  resembled  a 
mass  of  towering  clouds.  Of  incomparable  loveliness,  it  seemed 
as  if  heaven  itself  had  descended  on  earth  and  its  beauty  was 
dazzling.  Teeming  with  innumerable  gems,  trees  of  every  kind 
covered  it  with  flowers  like  the  summit  of  a  mountain  on  which 
snow  has  fallen ;  beautiful  women  served  as  its  ornaments  and 
it  shone  like  a  cloud  riven  by  lightning  ;  such  was  its  splendour 
that  it  resembled  a  marvellous  chariot  drawn  through  the  skies 
by  ravishing  swans. 

Like  the  peak  of  a  mountain  rich  in  ore  or  the  firmament 
adorned  by  the  moon  and  stars  or  like  clouds  of  many  hues, 
it  glistened  with  innumerable  gems.  Artificial  rocks  made  of 
clay,  resembling  mountain  ranges,  planted  with  counterfeit 
trees  laden  with  heaps  of  flowers,  fashioned  with  stamens  and 
leaves  could  be  seen  there  and  improvised  dwellings,  dazzlingly 
white,  with  pools  covered  with  flowering  lotuses  possessing 
golden  stamens,  and  diverse  groves  and  ravishing  fountains. 

The  monkey  gazed  on  the  vast  aerial  chariot  named  Pushpaka, 
which,  gleaming  like  pearl,  planed  above  the  highest  buildings 
and  contained  birds  made  of  emerald,  silver  and  coral  and 
serpents  marvellously  fashioned  of  various  metals  and  life-sized 
horses  and  birds  with  charming  beaks  and  wonderful  wings 
which  contracted  and  expanded,  their  plumage  like  that  of 
Kama  himself,  posed  on  gold  and  coral  flowers ;  and  there  were 
elephants  with  tapering  trunks,  bearing  lotus  leaves,  engaged  in 
showering  water  on  the  Goddess*  Lakshmi,  who,  seated  in  a  pool, 
held  lotuses  in  her  fair  hands. 

Such  was  the  marvellous  creation  which  met  the  astonished 
monkey's  gaze,  which  resembled  a  mountain  of  charming  caverns 
or  a  tree  from  whose  hollows  delicious  fragrance  escapes  in  the 
springtime. 

353 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Yet  that  monkey  searching  that  exalted  city,  protected  by  the 
ten-headed  Ravana,  was  unable  to  find  the  daughter  of  Janaka, 
so  highly  regarded  and  deeply  afflicted  and  who  had  been  con- 
quered by  the  virtue  and  valour  of  her  lord.  And  not  finding 
Janaka's  daughter,  despite  his  investigations  and  the  vigilance 
of  his  search,  the  illustrious  Hanuman,  who  was  virtuous  and 
generous  of  soul,  felt  a  burning  anguish  take  possession  of  his 
heart. 


chapter    8 

A  further  Description  of  the  Aerial  Chariot  Pushpaka 

Halting  there,  the  intelligent  monkey,  born  of  Pavana,  regarded 
that  splendid  chariot  encrusted  with  gold  and  gems  more  care- 
fully. Fashioned  of  plated  gold,  embellished  with  lovely  images, 
regarded  by  Vishwakarma  himself  as  an  incomparable  artistic 
achievement,  travelling  in  space  like  a  guiding  light  in  the  orbit 
of  the  sun,  it  was  immeasurably  resplendent.  No  detail  of 
that  car  had  been  executed  unskilfully,  no  ornament  but  appeared 
to  be  a  jewel  of  great  price  nor  was  there  anything  surpassed  by 
the  chariots  of  the  Gods,  every  part  being  excellently  wrought. 
By  the  merit  of  his  asceticism  and  contemplation  Ravana 
had  obtained  it  and  it  repaired  wheresoever  its  master  directed 
it  by  the  power  of  his  thought.  Irresistible  and  swift  as  the 
wind,  a  source  of  happiness  to  those  magnanimous  beings 
given  to  pious  deeds,  who  had  reached  the  peak  of  prosperity 
and  glory,  capable  of  ranging  the  firmament,  containing  many 
apartments  and  furnished  with  innumerable  works  of  art, 
captivating  to  the  mind,  stainless  as  the  autumnal  moon,  re- 
sembling a  mountain  with  splendid  peaks,  borne  by  thousands 
of  demons  whose  cheeks  were  graced  with  earrings,  voracious 
eaters,  of  large  unwinking  eyes,  who  travelled  through  space 
with  exceeding  velocity  day  and  night,  that  aerial  chariot, 
Pushpaka,  splendid  to  look  upon,  covered  with  flowers,  fairer 
than  spring  itself,  drew  the  gaze  of  that  Prince  of  Monkey 
Warriors.

CHAPTER    9 

Hanmnan  searches  the  Harem 

Within  these  precincts,  a  magnificent  building,  remarkable 
for  its  spaciousness  and  splendour,  arrested  the  attention  of 
Hanuman,  the  son  of  Maruta  ;  it  was  two  miles  in  width, 
four  in  length  and  belonged  to  the  King  of  the  Titans  himself. 

And  Hanuman,  the  slayer  of  his  foes,  ranging  here  and  there 
in  search  of  the  Princess  of  Videha,  the  large-eyed  Sita,  beheld 
that  goodly  residence  where  the  titans  dwelt  together  and  he 
approached  the  palace  of  the  king,  surrounded  by  three  and 
four  tusked  elephants  and  guarded  in  its  entire  length  by 
warriors  bearing  weapons  in  their  hands.  He  beheld  that 
dwelling,  thronged  with  titan  women,  consorts  of  Havana, 
and  also  the  daughters  of  kings  who  had  been  forcibly  carried 
away  by  him,  which  resembled  an  ocean  teeming  with  crocodiles, 
sharks,  whales,  enormous  fish  and  serpents,  agitated  by  the 
force  of  the  tempest.  And  the  splendour  of  the  abode  of  Vaish- 
ravana,  Chandra  and  Harivahana  was  reflected  in  Havana's 
palace,  a  splendour  that  was  unequalled  and  changeless  and 
the  prosperity  of  the  residences  of  Kuvera,  Yama  and  Varuna 
were  rivalled,  nay  surpassed,  by  that  of  the  titan's  abode. 

In  the  centre  of  that  palace,  the  offspring  of  the  wind,  saw 
yet  another  edifice,  well  constructed  and  furnished  with  in- 
numerable grilles.  Formerly  created  in  heaven  at  Brahma's 
wish  by  Vishwakarma,  that  noble  car  embellished  with  gems 
was  called  Pushpaka,  which  Kuvera  had  acquired  by  pro- 
longed austerities  and  of  which  the  King  of  the  Titans,  having 
vanquished  him  by  his  might,  took  possession.  And  that 
mighty  monkey  ascended  that  splendid  car,  containing  figures 
of  wolves  made  of  Kartasvara  and  Hiranya  gold  and  adorned 
with  slender  pillars  of  dazzling  splendour,  furnished  with 
private  rooms  and  gleaming  pavilions,  resembling  the  Meru 
and  Mandara  Mountains,  licking  the  skies  and  blazing  like  the

SUNDARA    KANDA 

This  masterpiece  of  Vishwakarma  had  many  golden  stairways 
and  a  superb  and  marvellous  ceiling;  it  contained  balconies 
and  galleries  of  deep  blue  sapphire  and  other  precious  gems ; 
the  floors  were  encrusted  with  rare  pearls  which  rendered  it 
blindingly  beautiful ;  built  of  red  sandalwood  and  shining 
like  pure  gold,  it  resembled  the  rising  sun  and  subtle  perfumes 
rose  therefrom. 

That  mighty  monkey,  stationed  there,  smelt  the  rich  odour 
of  wines  and  viands  which  rose  on  every  side,  and  those 
ambrosial  and  penetrating  fumes  seemed  to  him  to  be  the 
embodiment  of  Anila  herself  and  were  inhaled  by  him  as 
coming  from  an  intimate  friend,  and  that  aroma  seemed  to 
say  to  Hanuman  "  Come  hither  where  Ravana  is  to  be  found  ", 
and  he  proceeded  further  and  beheld  a  vast  and  glorious  hall. 

Now  that  spacious  apartment  was  very  dear  to  Ravana, 
who  looked  on  it  as  a  greatly  cherished  woman  and  its  jewelled 
stairways  and  galleries  of  pure  gold  gave  it  a  dazzling  appear- 
ance, the  floors  being  of  crystal  with  inlay  of  ivory,  pearl, 
diamond,  coral,  silver  and  gold.  It  was  adorned  with  many 
jewelled  pilasters,  which  were  symetrical,  straight,  elegant  and 
inlaid  with  exceeding  artistry  and  it  was  supported  by  tall 
pillars  of  equal  size  resembling  wings  so  that  the  building 
seemed  to  be  flying  in  the  air  and  the  floor  was  covered  by 
a  carpet,  wide  and  four-cornered  like  the  earth1  and  patterned 
as  with  varied  countries*  kingdoms  and  dwellings,  and  there 
the  song  of  birds  could  be  heard  and  it  was  pervaded  by  a 
celestial  fragrance. 

Hung  with  rich  tapestries,  darkened  by  incense  fumes, 
spotless  and  pure  as  a  swan,  garlanded  with  leaves  and  flowers 
lending  it  the  resemblance  of  Kamadhenu,  bringing  delight  to 
the  heart,  colour  to  the  cheek,  giving  birth  to  prosperity  and 
banishing  all  sorrow,  the  apartments  of  the  King  of  the  Titans 
gratified  every  sense,  as  if  it  were  a  mother. 

Entering  that  abode  protected  by  Ravana,  Hanuman 
asked  himself:  "  Can  this  be  paradise  or  the  region  of  the 
Gods  or  Indra's  capital  or  the  state  of  supreme  bliss  ?  " 
and  he  examined  the  golden  lamps,  which  resembled  gamblers 

1  Four-Cornered — The  ancient  Hindu  belief  was  that  the  earth  was  four- 
cornered. 

355  2a 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

absorbed  in  their  dice,  who,  defeated  by  their  opponents,  are 
plunged  in  thought,  and  Hanuman  perceived  that  the  brilli- 
ance of  the  lamps  and  the  lustre  of  Ravana  and  the  splendour 
of  the  decorations,  illumined  the  appartment. 

He  beheld  innumerable  women,  lying  on  the  rugs,  attired 
in  every  kind  of  raiment  with  wreaths  on  their  heads,  who, 
under  the  influence  of  wine,  had  fallen  asleep,  having  ceased 
to  disport  themselves,  half  the  night  being  spent.  And,  on 
account  of  the  silence,  that  great  company,  decked  with  orna- 
ments, the  tinkling  of  which  was  no  longer  audible,  resembled 
a  vast  lake  filled  with  lotuses  where  the  sound  of  the  swans 
and  the  humming  of  bees  has  ceased. 

Maruti  gazed  on  the  faces  of  those  lovely  women  with  eyes 
and  mouths  shut  fast,  emitting  a  flower-like  fragrance  and  they 
resembled  lotuses  that,  folding  their  petals  at  evening,  wait 
for  the  dawn  to  open  them  once  more  or  like  water  lilies 
which  the  bees,  intoxicated  with  love,  visit  continually.  With 
just  cause  did  that  noble  and  mighty  monkey  compare  rhem  to 
nymphoeae,  for  the  harem  was  bright  with  their  radiance,  as 
the  starry  heavens  on  a  serene  autumnal  night  and,  in  their 
midst,  the  King  of  the  Titans  blazed  like  a  fair  moon,  encircled 
by  attendant  stars. 

Then  that  monkey  said  to  himself :  "  Those  planets  that 
have  fallen  from  the  firmament,  their  merit  exhausted,  are  all 
re-united  here  ",  and  in  sooth,  those  women  in  their  grace, 
beauty  and  magnificence  shone  like  dazzling  meteors. 

Some  lay  wrapped  in  slumber  into  which  they  had  fallen  in 
the  midst  of  dancing  and  feasting,  their  hair  and  crowns  in 
disarray,  their  ornaments  scattered  here  and  there;  others 
amongst  those  lovely  beings  had  lost  their  anklets  and  the 
tilaka  mark  on  their  foreheads  had  been  effaced ;  some  had 
allowed  their  garlands  to  fall  aside,  some  had  broken  their 
pearls  and,  their  raiment  in  disorder,  their  girdles  loosened, 
resembled  disburdened  mules,  whilst  others,  bereft  of  ear- 
rings, their  garlands  torn  and  crushed,  looked  like  flowering 
creepers  trodden  under  foot  by  great  elephants  in  the  forest. 

Sometimes  the  loosened  pearls,  like  the  scintillating  rays  of 
the  moon,  lay  between  the  women's  breasts  like  sleeping  swans, 
whilst  chains  of  emerald  resembled  drakes  or  those  of  gold 
356 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

looked  like  Chakravata  birds.  And  those  women  were  like 
unto  rivers,  their  thighs  being  the  banks,  where  swans,  geese 
and  other  waterfowl  disport  themselves  or,  sleeping,  resembled 
streams,  the  golden  bells  on  their  girdles,  the  ripples,  their 
faces,  the  lotuses,  their  amorous  desires,  the  crocodiles,  their 
grace,  the  banks. 

On  their  tender  limbs  the  marks  of  the  ornaments  looked 
like  bees,  whilst  the  veils  of  others,  rising  and  falling  with  their 
breath,  fluttered  gracefully  before  their  faces  like  bright  streamers 
of  many-coloured  yarn  and  the  earrings  of  others  vibrated 
gently  with  the  circulating  air. 

Their  subtly  perfumed  breath  impregnated  with  the  aroma  of 
sugar-sweetened  wines  which  they  had  drunk,  caused  Ravana 
delight  and,  some  of  his  consorts,  in  dream,  savoured  the  lips 
of  their  rivals  again  and  again,  deeming  them  to  be  the  king's. 
Passionately  devoted  to  their  lord,  these  lovely  women,  no 
longer  mistresses  of  themselves,  offered  their  companions 
marks  of  their  affection.  Some,  in  their  rich  attire,  slept 
leaning  on  their  arms  laden  with  bracelets,  some  rested  on 
their  companions'  breasts,  some  on  their  laps,  their  bosoms, 
their  thighs  and  backs,  and  under  the  influence  of  wine,  cling- 
ing amorously  to  one  another,  those  women  of  slender  waist, 
slept,  their  arms  intertwined. 

Those  groups  of  damsels  enfolding  one  another,  resembled 
a  garland  of  flowers  visited  by  amorous  bees  or,  like  creepers 
opening  to  the  caress  of  the  vernal  breeze  that  intertwine, 
forming  clusters  of  blossom  or  the  interlocking  branches  of 
great  forest  trees  full  of  swarming  bees ;  thus  seemed  this 
gathering  of  Ravana's  consorts.  And  on  account  of  the 
proximity  of  these  women,  sleeping  close  to  one  another,  it 
was  impossible  to  distinguish  to  whom  the  jewels,  veils  and 
garlands  covering  their  limbs,  belonged. 

While  Ravana  slept,  the  beauty  of  those  women  resembling 
golden  lamps,  seemed  to  watch  over  him  and  there  were 
daughters  of  Rajarishis,  Giants  and  Celestial  Beings,  who  had 
become  his  consorts  and  that  war-like  titan  king  had  acquired 
them  after  subduing  their  relatives,  though  some  had  followed 
him  of  their  own  accord  from  love.  None  had  been  forcibly 
borne  away  who  had  not  been  attracted  by  his  prowess  and 
357 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 
qualities  and  none  had  belonged  to  another,  save  the  daughter 
of  Janaka  whose  heart  was  set  on  Rama ;    none  was  devoid 
of  nobility,  beauty,  intelligence  and  grace  and  each  was  the 
object  of  Havana's  desire. 

Then  the  lord  of  the  monkeys,  endowed  with  virtue,  reflected: 
"  If  the  consort  of  Raghava  were  as  one  of  these  women,  the 
King  of  the  Titans  wou!d  indeed  be  blessed  to-day,  but  Sita 
is  far  superior  to  them  on  account  of  her  great  qualities,  which 
is  evident,  since  for  her  sake  that  mighty  monarch  of  Lanka 
has  committed  this  wicked  deed. 


CHAPTER     10 

Hanuman  sees  Havana  surrounded  by  his   Wives 

Looking  round,  Hanuman  observed  a  splendid  dais,  worthy 
of  the  Gods,  made  of  crystal  encrusted  with  pearls,  furnished 
with  couches  of  emerald  mounted  on  ivory  and  gold  and 
covered  with  rich  and  priceless  rugs.  And  he  saw  a  white 
canopy,  in  that  place,  festooned  with  celestial  garlands  that 
gleamed  like  the  moon. 

And  he  observed  a  magnificent  couch  inlaid  with  gold, 
flaming  like  fire  and  bearing  garlands  of  Ashoka  flowers, 
around  which  figures  were  waving  fans  to  and  fro,  creating 
cooling  draughts  and  perfumes  of  every  kind  wreathed  it  with 
delicious  fragrance.  Spread  with  soft  woollen  cloths  and 
decked  with  chaplets  of  flowers,  it  was  adorned  on  every  side. 

And  there,  resembling  a  thundercloud,  the  Sovereign  of  the 
Titans  lay  with  bright  and  flashing  earrings,  reddened  eyes, 
golden  raiment,  his  limbs  smeared  with  saffron  and  fragrant 
sandal,  like  a  purple  cloud  at  dusk,  riven  with  lightning.  Adorned 
with  celestial  ornaments,  magnificent  to  behold,  able  to  change 
his  form  at  will,  as  he  lay  asleep  he  resembled  the  Mandara 
Mountain  with  its  trees,  groves  and  bushes  without  number. 
Having  ceased  from  dalliance,  decked  with  priceless  ornaments, 
the  delight  of  the  titans  and  dear  to  all  the  titan  women,  his 
feasting  over  he  lay  sleeping  on  the  golden  bed,  breathing 
like  a  serpent. 

358 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

And  Hanuman,  filled  with  awe,  shrank  back  in  fear,  and 
stationed  himself  on  a  landing  of  the  stairway,  pressing  himself 
against  the  inner  wall;  then  that  courageous  monkey  looked 
down  on  that  lion  among  titans  lying  there  in  a  drunken  stupor. 
And  as  the  King  of  the  Titans  lay  sleeping,  his  luxurious 
couch  resembled  a  great  waterfall  by  which  a  mighty  tusker 
in  mustha  is  resting. 

Hanuman  looked  down  on  the  two  outstretched  arms, 
encircled  with  golden  bracelets  of  that  gigantic  monarch, 
resembling  the  standards  of  Indra,  which  had  formerly  been 
pierced  in  combat  by  the  sharp  tusks  of  Airavata  and  torn  by 
the  discus  of  Vishnu  and  the  great  shoulders  that  had  been 
lacerated  by  India's  mace.  Those  vast  arms,  firmly  set  with 
well-formed,  powerful  muscles  and  thumbs  and  nails  bearing 
auspicious  marks,  rings  coverings  the  fingers,  those  arms, 
thick  as  clubs,  rounded  like  the  trunk  of  an  elephant,  that 
lay  along  the  opulent  couch  as  it  were  two  snakes  with  five 
heads,  smeared  with  sandal  of  the  colour  of  hare's  blood, 
fresh,  extremely  rare  and  of  a  delicious  fragrance  massaged  by 
women  of  sovereign  beauty  with  precious  unguents,  those 
arms  that  had  caused  Yakshas,  Pannagas,  Gandharvas  Devas 
and  Danavas  to  cry  out  in  terror,  that  monkey  gazed  upon 
as  they  lay  along  the  couch,  like  two  great  and  angry  reptiles 
sleeping  in  a  cave  on  the  Mandara  Mountain.  And  with  his 
two  great  arms,  the  Chief  of  the  Titans  resembled  Mount 
Mandara  with  its  twin  peaks. 

The  scent  of  the  Mango  or  Punnaga  tree,  impregnated  with 
that  of  the  Bakula  blended  with  the  savour  of  viands  and  the 
aroma  of  wine,  issued  from  the  vast  mouth  of  that  Monarch 
of  Titans  during  sleep  and  seemed  to  fill  the  whole  apartment. 
His  diadem  was  decorated  with  rubies  and  precious  stones, 
gleaming  with  gold  and  he  was  adorned  with  earrings,  smeared 
with  red  sandal,  his  well-developed  chest  bearing  a  string  of 
pearls ;  a  white  silken  cloth,  flung  aside,  revealed  his  scars 
and  he  was  covered  with  a  costly  yellow  coverlet.  Like  a 
mass  of  light  he  lay,  hissing  like  a  serpent  so  that  it  seemed 
as  if  an  elephant  lay  asleep  in  the  deep  waters  of  the  Ganges. 
Four  lamps,  set  on  golden  pillars,  cast  their  light  to  the  four 
sides  as  lightning  reveals  the  surface  of  a  mass  of  cloud.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Then  that  foremost  of  monkeys  saw  the  wives  of  that  great 
monarch  of  the  titans  sleeping  at  the  foot  of  their  lord,  their 
faces  bright  as  the  moon,  wearing  precious  earrings  and  fresh 
garlands.  Skilled  musicians  and  dancers,  they  lay  in  the  arms 
and  on  the  breast  of  that  Indra  of  Titans,  attired  in  beautiful 
raiment,  and  the  monkey  gazed  on  those  women  wearing 
golden  bracelets  and  earrings  set  with  diamonds  and  emeralds, 
their  faces  fair  as  the  moon,  illumined  by  the  reflection  of 
their  glittering  earrings,  lighting  the  hall  as  stars  illumine  the 
firmament. 

Overcome  with  drinking  and  amorous  dalliance,  those  slender- 
waisted  wives  of  the  King  of  the  Demons  lay  fast  asleep  where 
they  had  been  seated ;  and  one,  possessed  of  lovely  limbs, 
skilled  in  the  dance,  slept  there,  wearied  by  her  graceful  motions, 
whilst  another,  embracing  her  Vina,  looked  like  a  lotus  that  had 
fallen  into  the  water  clinging  to  a  passing  raft ;  a  third  dark- 
eyed  maiden  held  her  Mankuka  in  her  lap,  as  a  youthful  woman 
would  her  child,  while  yet  another  with  graceful  limbs  and 
shapely  bosom,  slept  with  her  tambourine  pressed  to  her  heart, 
as  one  embraces  his  love  after  a  long  absence.  This  one, 
with  eyes  like  lotuses  had  fallen  asleep  clasping  her  Vina,  as  a 
beautiful  girl  enfolds  her  beloved  one  affectionately  in  her  arms. 
Here  one  of  restrained  sense  lay  beside  her  lute  which  she 
encircled  with  her  arms,  resembling  one  affianced  lying  by 
the  side  of  her  chosen  one ;  there,  one  whose  limbs  gleamed  like 
Kanada  gold,  dimpled,  ravishing,  her  eyes  heavy  with  wine, 
though  sleeping,  was  striking  her  drum.  One  of  slender  waist 
and  flawless  beauty,  worn  out  by  feasting,  slept  with  a  cymbal 
in  her  lap  and  yet  another  held  a  Dindima  and  had  another 
slung  on  her  back  so  that  she  looked  like  a  young  mother 
with  her  husband  and  her  child.  One,  with  eyes  large  as  lotus 
petals,  clasping  her  Adambara  tightly  to  her  breast,  had  fallen 
asleep  under  the  influence  of  wine  and  yet  another,  her  water 
vessel  overturned,  resembled  a  flowery  wreath  that  is  sprinkled 
with  water  to  keep  it  green ;  another,  falling  under  the  sway 
of  sleep,  with  her  hands  covered  her  breasts  resembling  two 
golden  cups,  and  one,  with  eyes  like  lotuses,  fair  as  the  moon, 
had  fallen  asleep  embracing  one  of  her  companions  possessed 
of  lovely  nips.  Peerlessly  beautiful  women,  clasping  musical 
360 


s;un;dara  kanda 

instruments,  pressed  them  to  their  bosoms  like  lovers  their 
chosen  ones. 

And  that  monkey  beheld  a  marvellous  bed  set  apart,  on 
which  one  of  these  lovely  women  lay,  richly  attired,  adorned 
with  pearls  and  precious  gems,  who  seemed  to  lend  radiance 
to  that  magnificent  apartment.  Clad  in  silk  bright  as  Kanaka 
gold,  Havana's  favourite  Queen,  Mandodari  by  name,  that 
slender-waisted  woman  of  gracious  features,  lay  fast  asleep, 
adorned  with  ornaments  and,  seeing  her,  that  offspring  of  the 
Wind  -God  said  to  himself :  "  This  one,  endowed  with  the 
wealth  of  youth  and  beauty  may  be  Sita  "  and  he  rejoiced 
exceedingly.  Thereafter,  in  his  delight,  he  leapt  into  the  air, 
waving  his  tail  and  manifesting  his  joy  by  his  antics,  frolicking, 
singing,  climbing  up  the  pillars  from  whence  he  dropped 
to  the  ground,  thus  demonstrating  his  monkey  nature. 


CHAPTER     II 

Description  of  the  Banqueting  Hall 

Then  that  mighty  monkey  dismissed  this  thought  concerning 
Sita  and  began  to  reflect  further  : 

"  Separated  from  Rama,  that  lovely  woman  would  be  unable 
to  sleep,  eat  or  adorn  herself  nor  would  she  submit  to  any 
other,  were  he  King  of  the  Celestials  himself,  for  Rama  has 
no  equal  even  among  the  Gods ;  this  is  therefore  some  other." 

In  this  conviction,  that  foremost  of  monkeys  began  to  search 
the  banqueting  hall  anew,  anxious  to  discover  Sita. 

Leaning  on  their  tambourines,  drums  and  Celikas,  or 
stretched  on  luxurious  couches,  all  these  women  slept  soundly, 
worn  out  with  playing,  singing,  dancing  and  drinking.  And 
that  leader  of  monkeys  saw  thousands  of  women  beautifully 
adorned,  some  having  fallen  asleep  discussing  each  other's 
charms,  some  debating  the  art  of  singing,  some  skilled  in  dis- 
cerning time  and  place,  discoursing  on  circumstance,  some 
given  over  to  merriment  and,  elsewhere  also,  he  observed 
beautiful  and  youthful  women  who  had  fallen  asleep  talking  of 
36i 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

beauty,  or,  full  of  perspicacity,  deciding  what  was  opportune. 
And  in  their  midst,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  resembled  a  bull 
in  a  spacious  stall,  surrounded  by  graceful  kine.  Encircled 
by  those  women,  that  King  of  the  Titans  looked  like  a  mighty 
tusker  accompanied  by  female  elephants  in  the  forest. 

In  the  abode  of  that  powerful  Titan  King,  that  lion  among 
monkeys  searched  the  banqueting  hall  throughout,  furnished 
with  every  desirable  object  and  he  beheld  the  flesh  of  buffalo, 
deer  and  bear  in  separate  dishes  together  with  peacock  and 
fowl  on  golden  platters,  that  had  not  been  broached,  and 
percupine,  deer  and  peacocks,  seasoned  with  curds  and  sochal 
salt  and  goats,  leverets  and  fish  half  consumed,  with  portions 
of  dressed  venison  and  sauces.  There  were  wines  of  superior 
vintage  and  rare  dishes  with  salted  pies  spiced  with  vinegar 
and  diverse  confections  capable  of  stimulating  the  appetite. 
Costly  bracelets  and  anklets  were  scattered  here  and  there 
and  fruit  was  arranged  in  small  dishes,  whilst  flowers  were 
spread  about,  lending  the  whole  floor  an  air  of  splendour,  and 
elegant  couches  and  seats  set  round  that  place  of  feasting 
caused  it  to  shine  like  fire.  In  addition,  meats  of  every  kind 
and  flavour,  seasoned  with  diverse  substances  and  dressed  by 
skilful  cooks,  were  placed  round  the  hall  and  Hanuman  ob- 
served delicious  beverages  made  of  a  variety  of  ingredients, 
some  from  sugar,  some  distilled  from  fruit  and  flowers  or 
impregnated  with  fragrant  powders. 

The  vast  floor  reflected  the  innumerable  garlands,  golden 
vessels,  crystal  bowls  and  cups  lying  everywhere  and  looked 
exceedingly  beautiful  and  that  mighty  monkey  saw  golden 
wine  jars  studded  with  gems,  some  of  which  were  full  of  wine, 
some  half  full  and  some  wholly  drained ;  and  there  were  many 
wines  that  had  not  yet  been  served  and  various  kinds  of  viands 
that  remained  untouched. 

Elsewhere  he  saw  many  couches  that  were  unoccupied,  and 
some,  where  women  of  unsurpassed  beauty  slept,  clasping  each 
other  in  their  arms.  One  of  these  youthful  women  had  forcibly 
possessed  herself  of  another's  quilt  and,  wrapping  herself 
therein,  had  fallen  asleep.  The  gentle  breathing  of  these 
women  barely  stirred  their  attire  or  the  garlands  that  adorned 
them  but  caressed  them  as  it  were  and  a  gentle  breeze,  laden 
362 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

with  the  odour  of  sandal  and  the  sweet-tasting  Sidhu,  with 
the  diverse  floral  wreaths  and  flowers,  perfumed  bark  pre- 
pared for  ablutions  and  incense,  spread  over  the  aerial  car, 
Pushpaka. 

And  in  that  residence  of  the  titan  there  were  women  of 
incomparable  beauty,  some  dark-skinned,  some  the  colour  of 
Kancana  gold,  who,  overcome  by  slumber  and  worn  out  with 
dalliance,  resembled  sleeping  lotuses. 

Thus  that  mighty  monkey  searched  every  quarter  of  Havana's 
private  apartments  without  seeing  Janaki  anywhere  and, 
having  scanned  the  faces  of  all  these  women,  he  was  filled  with 
apprehension,  fearing  lest  he  had  failed  in  his  purpose.  Then 
he  reflected :  "  Beholding  the  wife  of  another  while  she  is 
sleeping,  is  undoubtedly  an  infringement  of  the  moral  law, 
verily  to  look  on  another's  wife  was  never  my  intention  but 
here  I  have  seen  one  who  hath  lusted  after  the  wives  of  others." 

Then  another  thought  came  to  that  sagacious  monkey, 
single-mindedly  bent  on  the  execution  of  his  duty :  "All 
these  consorts  of  Ravana  have  been  beheld  by  me  without 
their  knowledge  yet  I  find  no  fluctuation  in  the  tenor  of  my  mind. 
The  mind  is  the  motive  power  of  every  movement  of  the 
senses,  whether  it  be  good  or  evil  and  mine  remains  untroubled  ; 
further,  how  could  I  search  for  Sita  otherwise  ?  It  is  amongst 
women  that  one  should  look  for  women ;  every  being  is  to  be 
sought  amongst  its  own  kind,  none  searches  for  a  woman  among 
deer.  Therefore  with  a  pure  heart  I  have  explored  Ravana's 
inner  apartment  but  I  have  not  seen  the  daughter  of  Janaka." 

And  Hanuman  scrutinized  the  faces  of  the  daughters  of 
Devas,  Danavas  and  Nagas,  without  finding  Sita  and,  not 
finding  her  in  that  place,  he  left  the  banqueting  hall  and 
began  to  search  elsewhere.  Leaving  that  place  of  feasting,  the 
offspring  of  the  Wind-god  began  to  look  for  Sita  in  another 
quarter.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     12 

Hanuman  becomes  despondent 

Remaining  in  the  precincts  of  the  palace,  Hanuman  searched 
the  arbours,  galleries  and  the  sleeping  apartments,  eager  to 
discover  Sita  but  without  being  able  to  find  that  lady  of 
gracious  appearance  there ;  and,  not  finding  the  beloved  of  that 
descendant  of  Raghu,  the  mighty  monkey  reflected : — 

"  Since,  despite  mine  exertions  I  am  unable  to  find  the 
daughter  of  Mithila,  assuredly  Sita  is  no  longer  alive.  That 
youthful  and  virtuous  woman,  anxious  to  defend  her  honour, 
has  been  slain  by  the  wicked  Lord  of  the  Titans  for  remaining 
faithful  to  her  conjugal  duty  or  the  daughter  of  King  Janaka 
has  died  of  fright  on  seeing  those  consorts  of  the  Sovereign 
of  the  Titans,  who  are  deformed,  sallow-skinned,  misshapen 
and  who  possess  huge  heads  and  monstrous  forms.  Failing 
to  discover  Sita,  my  valour  has  been  expended  in  vain  and  a 
large  part  of  the  term  allotted  to  the  monkeys  has  run  out; 
I  dare  not  present  myself  before  Sugriva,  who  is  powerful  and 
given  to  meting  out  harsh  punishment.  I  have  explored  the 
inner  apartments  thoroughly  but  the  gentle  Sita  was  not  to  be 
found  there  and  I  have  spent  myself  in  vain.  Further,  on 
my  return,  the  assembled  monkeys  will  enquire  of  me  saying : 
"  O  Valiant  Hanuman,  having  reached  the  further  shore,  what 
didst  thou  accomplish  there,  tell  us  ?  " 

Not  having  seen  Janaka's  daughter,  what  shall  I  answer? 
The  term  fixed  having  passed,  assuredly  it  is  meet  that  I  should 
fast  to  death,  and  what  will  the  aged  Jambavan  and  Angada 
say  with  all  the  assembled  monkeys  since  I  have  crossed  the 
ocean  to  no  purpose  ?  Yet  perseverance  is  the  root  of  success, 
perseverance  is  the  root  of  prosperity,  perseverance  brings 
supreme  felicity,  therefore  I  will  search  all  those  places  still 
left  unexplored  by  me.  Moreover  it  is  my  intention  to  put 
forth  fresh  efforts  and  investigate  all  those  regions  not  yet 
visited  by  me  and  the  banqueting  halls,  the  gardens,  the  sports 
pavilions,  the  courtyards,  dwellings,  highways,  alleys  and 
364 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

chariots,  though  already  searched  by  me,  shall  be  examined 
once  again. 

Having  thus  resolved,  Hanuman  set  about  exploring  the 
basements,  temples  and  many-storied  dwellings,  going  up  and 
down,  to  and  fro,  opening  doors  and  closing  others,  entering 
here  and  making  an  exit  there,  till  there  was  not  even  the 
space  of  four  fingers  left  unscrutinized  by  him.  And  he 
visited  the  galleries  running  inside  the  ramparts  and  terraces 
supported  by  stanchions  and  the  groves  and  lotus  pools  and 
he  saw  there  hideous  and  monstrous  female  titans  of  every 
shape  but  not  the  daughter  of  Janaka ;  and  the  illustrious 
consorts  of  Vidyadharas  fell  under  his  gaze  but  not  the  beloved 
of  Raghava. 

Hanuman  beheld  there  also  the  daughters  of  Nagas,  of  lovely 
limbs,  whose  faces  shone  like  the  full  moon,  who  had  been 
forcibly  brought  there  by  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  but  not  the 
cherished  daughter  of  Janaka  and,  not  seeing  her  among  all 
those  lovely  women,  a  profound  despair  seized  that  warrior 
born  of  Maruta. 

Reflecting  that  the  exertions  of  all  those  leaders  of  monkeys 
and  the  crossing  of  the  ocean  had  proved  vain,  the  son  of  Anila 
became  extremely  anxious  and  descended  from  that  aerial  car. 
Thereafter  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta,  grew  pensive  and  a 
great  melancholy  invaded  his  soul. 


CHAPTER     I  3 

Hanuman's  Dilenma 

Descending  on  to  the  ramparts  from  the  aerial  car,  that  leader 
of  monkeys,  the  agile  Hanuman,  resembled  a  flash  of  lightning 
athwart  the  clouds  and,  having  searched  the  apartments  of 
Ravana  without  finding  Sita,  Videha's  daughter,  he  said  to 
himself: — 

"  Seeking  the  object  of  Rama's  affection,  I  have  explored 
Lanka  again  and  again  without  rinding  the  daughter  of  Janaka 
of  immaculate  form  1    Many  times  have  the  marshes,  pools, 
365 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

lakes,  streams,  rivers,  banks,  forests  and  inaccessible  mountains 
been  scoured  by  me  without  any  trace  of  Sita  being  found  ! 

"  The  King  of  the  Vultures,  Sampati,  affirmed  that  Sita 
was  in  Havana's  palace  but  I  do  not  see  her  there,  how  can 
this  be  ?  Or  has  the  daughter  of  Videha,  Maithili,  born  of 
Janaka,  who  was  carried  away  against  her  will,  being  wholly 
helpless  surrendered  to  Havana?  Or  perchance,  fearing  Rama's 
arrows,  in  his  rapid  flight,  that  titan  has  allowed  Sita  to  slip 
from  his  grasp  or  she  seeing  herself  borne  away  on  the  path 
of  the  Siddhas  and  beholding  the  ocean,  has  yielded  up  her 
life  ?  Who  can  say  whether  that  noble  large-eyed  lady  has  not 
succumbed  on  account  of  the  great  speed  assumed  by  Ravana 
and  the  pressure  of  his  arms  ? 

"  It  may  happen  that,  while  Ravana  flew  over  the  sea,  the 
daughter  of  Janaka  struggling  to  free  herself,  fell  into  the  waves, 
or  alas,  far  from  her  lord,  seeking  to  defend  her  honour,  was 
devoured  by  that  vile  Ravana.  May  not  that  innocent  dark- 
eyed  lady  have  become  the  food  of  those  impure  consorts  of 
that  Indra  of  demons  ?  Ever  absorbed  in  the  contemplation  of 
Rama,  whose  countenance  resembles  the  moon,  has  she 
breathed  her  last,  bewailing  her  lot  and  crying :    *  O  Rama ! 

0  Lakshmana  J  O  Ayodhya ! ',  or,  having  been  banished  to 
the  dungeons  of  Ravana's  palace,  is  that  youthful  woman 
grieving  like  a  caged  bird?  How  could  the  slender-waisted 
consort  of  Rama,  born  of  the  blood  of  Janaka,  possessing  eyes 
like  lotus  petals,  submit  to  Ravana  ?  But  whether  she  be  slain 
or  is  lost  or  has  died,  I  dare  not  speak  of  it  to  Rama.  To 
tell  him  would  be  an  offence,  yet  it  is  also  wrong  to  with- 
hold it  from  him ;  what  should  I  do  ?  I  am  perplexed !  In 
such  a  dilemna,  how  shall  I  act  ?  " 

Thus  thinking,  Hanuman  added : — "  If,  without  finding  Sita, 

1  return  to  the  city  of  that  lord  among  monkeys,  in  how  far 
will  my  courage  have  availed  me  ?  My  crossing  of  the  ocean 
has  come  to  nought  as  also  my  entry  into  Lanka  and  my 
survey  of  the  titans.  When  I  come  to  Kishkindha,  what  will 
Sugriva  and  the  assembled  monkeys  say  to  me  or  those  twin 
sons  of  Dasaratha  ?  If  I  approach  Kakutstha  with  these  fatal 
tidings  saying :  '  I  have  not  found  Sita ',  he  will  give  up  his 
life.    Hearing  these  cruel,  terrible,  heartrending  and  barbarous 

366 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

words,  he  will  not  survive  and,  when  his  mind  has  been  with- 
drawn into  the  five  elements,  the  sagacious  Lakshmana,  deeply 
attached  to  Rama,  will  also  cease  to  exist !  Then,  hearing  that 
his  two  brothers  are  dead,  Bharata  will  yield  up  his  life  and 
Shatrughna  will  renounce  his  existence  also.  Beholding  their 
sons  dead,  their  mothers,  Kaushalya,  Sumitra  and  Kaikeyi 
will  undoubtedly  surrender  their  lives  and,  seeing  Rama's 
plight,  his  grateful  and  loyal  friend,  Sugriva,  will  give  up 
his  life.  Then  the  grief-stricken  Ruma,  distracted  and  crushed 
with  sorrow,  will  perish  on  account  of  her  lord  and  the  Queen 
Tara,  already  inconsolable  on  account  of  Bali's  end,  worn  out 
by  suffering  will  be  unable  to  continue  living.  The  loss  of 
his  parents  will  lead  the  youthful  Angada  to  the  brink  of  death 
and,  overwhelmed  by  the  passing  of  their  leader,  the  inhabitants 
of  the  woods  having  been  cherished  with  gentleness,  gifts  and 
regard  by  their  illustrious  monarch,  will  strike  their  heads 
with  their  fists  and  die. 

"  Thenceforth,  those  foremost  of  monkeys  will  no  longer 
assemble  to  disport  themselves  in  the  woods,  among  the  rocks 
and  caves,  but  with  their  sons,  wives  and  servants,  in  despair 
on  account  of  their  master's  death,  will  hurl  themselves  from 
the  height  of  the  rocks  into  the  abysses  and  chasms.  And  they 
will  take  poison  or  hang  themselves  or  enter  the  fire  or  fast 
to  death  or  fall  on  their  own  weapons.  It  is  certain  that  a  great 
calamity  will  follow  my  return  and  the  House  of  Ikshwaku 
and  the  inhabitants  of  the  forests  will  meet  with  destruction. 

"  But,  if  I  do  not  return,  those  two  virtuous  and  great  car- 
warriors  as  also  the  swift-footed  monkeys  will  continue  to  live 
in  the  hope  of  receiving  tidings  of  Sita,  and  I,  not  having 
found  Sita,  shall  exist  by  that  which  falls  to  my  lot,  living  a 
life  of  privation  and  subsisting  on  fruit  and  roots  in  the  forest. 

"  Preparing  a  funeral  pyre  on  the  shores  of  the  sea,  in  a  place 
abounding  in  roots,  fruits  and  water,  I  shall  enter  the  names 
or  allow  myself  to  die  of  hunger  and,  without  fail,  offer  my 
emaciated  frame  as  food  for  the  birds  and  beasts  of  prey. 
In  my  belief,  this  is  the  death  the  sages  envisaged  for  them- 
selves ;  either  I  must  find  Janaki  or  enter  the  sea. 

"  My  bright  garland  of  glory,  so  nobly  plaited  and  begot 
of  courageous  acts  has  perished  because  I  have  not  been  able 
367 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

to  find  Sita.  I  shall  therefore  become  an  ascetic  living  under 
the  trees  but  return  I  will  not  without  having  seen  that  dark- 
eyed  damsel.  If  I  go  back  without  finding  Sita,  neither 
Angada  nor  the  other  monkeys  will  survive.  Yet  incalculable 
ills  lie  in  store  for  one  taking  his  own  life ;  if  however  I  con- 
tinue to  live,  I  may  achieve  success,  therefore  I  shall  maintain 
my  existence !  If  I  live,  the  re-union  of  Rama  and  Sita  may 
be  effected." 

Revolving  these  innumerable  and  painful  considerations  in 
his  mind,  that  lion  among  monkeys  sought  to  prevent  himself 
from  being  overcome  by  despair.  Summoning  up  all  his 
courage,  that  mighty  monkey  said  to  himself: — 

"  I  shall  slay  Dashagriva  the  terrible  Ravana  and  thus 
avenge  the  abduction  of  Sita  or,  crossing  the  sea,  I  shall  drag 
him  before  Rama  as  a  beast  is  offered  up  to  Pashupati." 

Reflecting  thus,  that  monkey,  who  was  filled  with  anxiety 
and  grief,  not  having  been  able  to  find  Sita,  thought :  "  So 
long  as  I  do  not  find  the  illustrious  consort  of  Rama,  I  shall 
not  cease  from  searching  the  city  of  Lanka  on  every  side.  If, 
according  to  Sampati's  words,  I  bring  Rama  hither,  Raghava, 
not  beholding  his  consort,  will  burn  all  the  monkeys  with 
the  fire  of  his  wrath.  Therefore  I  shall  stay  here,  living  a 
life  of  abstinence  with  my  senses  under  control  lest  all  men 
and  monkeys  perish  through  my  fault. 

"  Here  is  a  great  Ashoka  grove,  containing  huge  trees,  which 
has  not  yet  been  searched  by  me.  Having  paid  reverence  to 
the  Vasus,  the  Rudras,  the  Adityas,  the  Ashwins  and  the 
Maruts,  in  order  to  increase  the  torment  of  the  titans,  I  shall 
enter  it.  Having  vanquished  the  demons,  I  shall  restore  the 
divine  Sita,  the  delight  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku  to  Rama 
as  the  fruit  of  austerity  is  bestowed  on  an  ascetic." 

Having  thus  reflected  for  a  space,  the  mighty  offspring  of 
the  Wind-god  suddenly  rose  and  said  :  "  Salutations  to  Rama 
accompanied  by  Lakshmana  and  Anila  !  Salutations  to  Chandra, 
Agni  and  the  Maruts  ! " 

After  paying  obeisance  to  all  the  Gods  as  also  to  Sugriva, 
the  offspring  of  the  Wind-god,  surveying  the  four  quarters, 
in  imagination  as  it  were  advanced  towards  that  magnificent 
grove  and  began  to  consider  what  should  be  done  further. 
363 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

He  reflected :  "  This  Ashoka  Grove  which  is  sacred  with 
its  dense  thickets  must  be  filled  with  titans,  its  trees  are  surely 
protected  by  trained  guards  and  the  blessed  Vishvatam 
himself  refrains  from  blowing  vigorously  here.  In  Rama's 
interests  I  shall  contract  my  form  so  that  I  may  not  be  detected 
by  Ravana.  May  all  the  Gods,  as  also  the  hosts  of  sages, 
confer  success  on  me !  May  Swyambhu,  the  Celestial  Beings, 
as  also  the  ascetics,  the  God  of  Fire,  the  God  of  the  Wind, 
the  Bearer  of  the  Thunderbolt,  Varuna,  the  Moon  and  the 
Sun,  the  high-souled  Ashwins  and  all  the  Maruts  grant  me 
success !  May  all  beings  and  the  Lord  of  all  Beings  and 
those  unknown,  who  are  met  with  on  the  way,  confer  success 
on  me ! 

"  When  shall  I  behold  that  noble  and  irreproachable  queen 
with  her  arched  nose,  pearly  teeth,  sweet  smile  and  eyes 
resembling  lotus  petals,  bright  as  the  King  of  the  Stars,  O  when  ? 

"  O  how  will  that  frail  and  virtuous  one,  ruthlessly  borne 
away  by  that  wicked  and  vile  wretch,  the  scourge  of  human 
beings,  who  masks  his  savagery  under  an  alluring  disguise, 
disclose  herself  to  me  ?  " 


chapter    14 

The  Ashoka  Grove 

Having  meditated  for  a  space,  Hanuman,  who  had  rejoined 
Sita  in  thought,  leapt  from  the  rampart  on  to  the  surrounding 
wall  and  trembling  with  delight,  that  mighty  monkey,  standing 
there,  beheld  every  variety  of  tree  and  flower,  it  being  early 
spring  He  saw  Sala,  Ashoka,  Bhavya,  Champaka,  Uddalaka, 
Nagavriksha,  Mango  and  Kapimukha  trees  in  flower  with 
clumps  of  Amras  intertwined  with  hundreds  of  creepers. 
And  Hanuman,  leaping  down  into  that  enchanting  grove, 
like  an  arrow  shot  from  a  bow,  entered  that  garden  resembling 
the  rising  sun  which  re-echoed  to  the  song  of  birds,  planted 
369 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

with  gold  and  silver  saplings  and  containing  flocks  of  birds 
and  deer  with  trees  of  varying  fragrance  which  .filled  him 
with  wonder. 

Abounding  in  trees  of  every  kind,  laden  with  flowers  and 
fruit,  where  cuckoos  called  deliriously  and  swarms  of  bees 
hummed,  where  all  creatures  expressed  happiness  in  their 
movements,  where  the  cries  of  the  peacock  could  be  heard  and 
waterfowl  teemed,  the  heart  of  the  beholder  was  ravished. 

And  Hanuman,  searching  for  that  princess  of  beautiful  and 
faultless  limbs,  woke  the  birds  that  had  been  sleeping  sweetly 
and  blown  by  the  wind  set  up  by  the  wings  of  those  birds  in 
flight,  a  shower  of  variegated  blossom  fell,  covering  Hanuman, 
the  son  of  the  Wind-god  in  the  midst  of  the  Ashoka  Grove 
lending  him  the  loveliness  of  a  hill  covered  with  flowers. 
Then  all  the  creatures  beholding  that  monkey,  as  they  darted 
from  all  sides,  thought :  "  It  is  the  God  of  Spring  ". 

Wholly  hidden  in  blossom  which  had  fallen  from  the  trees, 
the  earth  looked  like  a  bride  covered  with  jewels  and,  shaken 
in  diverse  ways  by  the  motion  of  that  impetuous  monkey 
the  trees  rained  down  a  shower  of  multi-coloured  blooms. 
And  those  trees,  whose  tops  were  stripped  of  leaves,  from 
which  both  blossom  and  fruit  had  fallen,  looked  like  gamblers 
who  have  staked  their  raiment  and  possessions  only  to  lose 
all.  Buffetted  by  Hanuman's  leaping,  those  lovely  trees 
speedily  let  their  flowers,  leaves  and  fruit  fall  to  the  ground 
and,  deserted  by  the  birds,  no  longer  able  to  seek  shelter  there, 
on  account  of  the  shaking  administered  by  Maruti,  presented 
their  bare  branches  only,  so  that  the  Ashoka  grove,  battered 
by  the  blows  of  the  monkey's  feet  and  tail,  resembled  a  youthful 
woman  with  her  locks  dishevelled,  the  brightness  of  her  lips 
and  teeth  dimmed,  her  tilaka  mark  effaced  and  her  arms  and 
legs  scarred.  And  in  his  haste,  that  monkey  snapped  the 
clusters  of  creepers  as  the  wind  dispels  the  clouds  during  the 
rainy  season. 

Banging  here  and  there,  that  monkey  observed  places  that 
were  paved  with  gold  and  silver  with  ponds  filled  with  trans- 
lucent water,  their  steps  encrusted  with  valuable  gems,  pearls 
and  coral,  their  floors  being  of  crystal  and  the  banks  set  with 
trees  of  Kancana  gold  which  emitted  a  dazzling  light. 
370 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

These  pools  were  covered  with  clumps  of  lotuses  and  lilies 
whilst  waterfowl  enhanced  their  beauty  and  they  re-echoed 
to  the  cry  of  Natyuhas,  swans  and  geese ;  broad  and  beautiful 
streams,  bordered  on  every  side  by  trees,  fed  them  with  their 
waters  which  resembled  Amrita  and  glided  under  variegated 
shrubs  decorated  by  hundreds  of  creepers,  the  ground  being 
carpeted  by  rhododendron  and  oleander  flowers. 

Then  that  foremost  of  monkeys  beheld  a  high  hill,  bright  as  a 
cloud  crowned  with  lofty  peaks,  many  kinds  of  trees  and  filled 
with  caves,  and  it  was  one  of  the  wonders  of  the  world  !  And 
he  beheld  a  river  falling  from  those  heights,  like  a  youthful 
woman  tearing  herself  from  her  lover's  aims  in  order  to  leave 
him  and  the  branches  of  the  trees,  sweeping  the  water,  looked 
as  if  the  companions  of  that  damsel  were  detaining  her,  whilst 
fuither  down,  Hanuman  beheld  that  stream  returning  on  its 
course,  as  if  the  maiden,  appeased,  were  reconciled  to  her  beloved. 

Thereafter  at  some  distance  from  the  river,  a  pool  filled  with 
lotuses,  frequented  by  birds  of  every  kind  drew  the  gaze  of 
that  lion  among  monkeys,  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta ;  and 
he  saw  a  fountain  of  fresh  water  with  enchanting  steps  made  of 
precious  gems,  its  basin  strewn  with  pearls,  which  was  embellished 
on  every  side  with  countless  herds  of  deer,  ravishing  groves, 
and  mansions  built  by  Vishvakarma  himself,  adorned  with 
artificial  woods  and  trees  laden  with  fruit  and  flowers,  their 
branches  spreading  like  umbrellas  giving  shade,  whilst  the 
ground  beneath  was  paved  with  gold  and  silver. 

And  that  great  monkey  beheld  a  single  golden  Shingshapa 
tree  surrounded  by  a  golden  dais  and  he  saw  many  flower  beds 
and  trees  which  resembled  flames,  the  radiance  of  which 
rivalled  Mount  Meru  and  caused  him  to  think  they  were  made 
of  gold.  Seeing  those  beautiful  golden  trees,  with  their 
flowering  crests,  buds  and  shoots  agitated  by  the  wind, 
emitting  a  sound  like  the  tinkling  of  many  ornaments,  Hanuman 
was  astounded. 

Climbing  quickly  into  that  many-leafed  Shingshapa  tree 
Hanuman  reflected :  "  From  here  I  may  perchance  behold 
Vaidehij  that  unhappy  being  who  sighs  for  Rama's  presence 
and  who,  filled  with  grief,  wanders  aimlessly  to  and  fro. 
Without  doubt,  this  Ashoka  Grove  embellished  by  Candana, 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Champaka  and  Vakula  trees,  belongs  to  the  wicked  Havana. 
Here  by  this  lovely  pool  frequented  by  birds,  that  princess  and 
royal  spouse,  Sita,  will  certainly  repair.  She,  the  beloved  of 
Raghava,  accustomed  to  wander  in  the  woods,  bereft  of  Rama, 
will  assuredly  come  hither.  That  lady,  whose  eyes  resemble 
a  doe's,  tormented  with  grief  on  account  of  separation  from 
Rama,  fond  of  roving  in  the  woods,  will  certainly  walk  in  this 
grove.  She,  the  chaste  and  virtuous  wife  of  Rama,  Janaka's 
daughter,  who  ever  loved  the  creatures  of  the  forest,  anxious 
to  offer  up  her  devotion,  will  come  to  this  river  of  translucent 
waters,  for  this  purpose. 

"  Truly  this  beautiful  grove  is  worthy  to  be  the  abode  of  that 
chaste  consort  of  the  king  of  men,  Rama.  If  that  goddess, 
whose  countenance  resembles  the  moon,  still  lives,  she  will 
inevitably  visit  this  river  of  cool  waters." 

Thus  reflected  the  high-souled  Hanuman,  expecting  the 
consort  of  that  lord  of  men  to  appear  and,  concealing  himself 
in  the  Shingshapa  tree  covered  with  leaves  and  flowers,  gazed 
out  over  the  whole  scene. 


CHAPTER    15 

Hanuman  sees  Sita 

Seated  in  the  tree,  glancing  round  in  quest  of  Sita,  Hanuman 
surveyed  the  entire  grove  filled  with  trees  intertwined  with 
creepers  and  redolent  with  celestial  odours.  Manifesting 
every  aspect  of  beauty,  possessing  the  splendour  of  the  Nandana 
Gardens,  it  was  inhabited  by  various  animals  and  birds, 
embellished  by  palaces  and  temples  and  re-echoed  to  the  call 
of  the  cuckoo.  Adorned  with  pools  filled  with  golden  lotuses 
and  silvery  waterlilies,  furnished  with  seats  and  cushions, 
buildings  and  courtyards,  with  its  ravishing  trees  laden  with 
fruit  and  flowers  in  every  season  and  the  blossoming  Ashoka 
trees,  it  resembled  the  effulgence  of  the  rising  sun. 

Seated  there,   Maruti  never  wearied  of  gazing  on  those 
lovely  woods,  whose  foliage  was  almost  concealed  by  hundreds 
of  birds  disporting  themselves  there  and  the  beauty  of  those 
372 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Ashoka  trees,  bending  under  the  weight  of  their  flowers,  so 
that  their  blossoming  seemed  to  extend  to  their  very  roots, 
dispelled  all  sorrow.  The  entire  region  seemed  ablaze  with 
the  brilliance  of  the  Karnikara  and  Kimshuka  trees  in  flower ; 
the  giant-rooted  Punnaga,  Saptaparna,  Champaka  and  Udda- 
laka  blazed  forth  in  blossom  and  there  were  thousands  of 
Ashoka  trees  some  of  a  golden  colour,  some  like  flames  of 
fire  and  some  as  dark  as  collyrium  so  that  the  whole  place 
resembled  the  Garden  of  Nandana  or  the  enchanting  domain  of 
Chaitaratha  or  even  surpassed  them.  This  celestial  un- 
imaginably beautiful  region  was  like  a  second  heaven,  having 
flowers  for  its  constellations  or  a  fifth  ocean,  its  pearls  being 
the  blossom  scattered  there.  Planted  with  trees,  which  bloomed 
in  every  season,  emitting  honeyed  scents,  that  garden  was  filled 
with  the  cries  of  birds  and  beasts  and  redolent  with 
exquisite  scents,  a  delicious  spot,  equal  to  that  King  of  Moun- 
tains, a  second  Gandhamadana. 

Now,  in  that  Ashoka  Grove,  that  lion  among  monkeys 
observed,  at  a  short  distance,  a  splendid  temple  as  white  as 
Mount  Kailasha,  flawless,  supported  by  a  thousand  pillars, 
its  steps  of  coral,  its  floors  of  refined  gold,  dazzlingly  beautiful, 
blinding  to  the  eyes  and  of  such  a  height  that  it  seemed  to 
kiss  the  sky. 

Then,  all  at  once,  he  beheld  a  woman,  in  soiled  raiment, 
surrounded  by  female  titans  and  she  was  emaciated  through 
fasting,  sorrowful,  heaving  frequent  sighs,  immaculate  as  the 
moon's  disc  in  its  first  quarter,  resplendent  with  a  radiance 
which  now  shone  but  dimly  so  that  she  seemed  like  a  flame 
wreathed  in  smoke. 

Clad  in  a  soiled  robe  of  yellow  silk,  divested  of  every  orna- 
ment, she  resembled  a  lotus  pool  stripped  of  its  flowers. 
Oppressed,  racked  with  grief  and  tormented,  she  was  like 
unto  Rohini  pursued  by  Ketu.  Her  face  bathed  in  tears, 
distressed,  worn  out  by  privation,  plunged  in  anxiety  and 
separated  from  her  kith  and  kin,  no  longer  able  to  behold 
Rama  and  Lakshmana  but  only  the  titans,  she  appeared  like 
a  gazelle  surrounded  by  a  pack  of  hounds. 

With  her  long  hair  resembling  a  black  serpent,  hanging 
down  her  back,  she  looked  like  the  earth  with  its  dark  blue 
373 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

forests  in  the  rainy  season.  That  large-eyed  lady,  worthy  of 
happiness,  not  having  known  adversity  till  that  hour,  sunk 
in  woe  and  emaciated  was  attired  in  soiled  raiment. 

Then  Hanuman,  beholding  her,  for  many  reasons  deduced 
that  it  was  Sita  and  reflected : — "  That  princess,  borne  away 
by  the  titan,  able  to  change  his  shape  at  will,  must  be  this 
woman  before  me." 

Her  race  shone  like  the  full  moon  and  she  possessed  beautiful 
brows  and  gracefully  rounded  breasts ;  by  her  radiance  she 
dispelled  the  darkness  in  all  regions ;  her  neck  was  of  a  bluish 
tint,  her  lips  like  the  Bimba  fruit,  her  waist  slender  and  her 
carriage  full  of  dignity,  her  eyes,  resembling  lotus  petals  equalled 
those  of  Rati,  the  beloved  spouse  of  Manmatha,  lovely  as  the 
moon,  adored  by  all. 

Now  that  youthful  woman  of  graceful  form  was  seated  on 
the  ground  practising  austerity  like  a  female  ascetic  and  that 
timid  lady  was  heaving  frequent  sighs  like  the  consort  of  the 
Serpent  King. 

Entangled  in  a  mighty  web  of  sorrow,  her  beauty  was  veiled 
like  a  flame  enveloped  in  smoke  or  a  traditional  text  obscured 
by  dubious  interpretation  or  wealth  that  is  melting  away  or 
faith  that  is  languishing  or  hope  that  is  almost  extinguished 
or  perfection  unattained  on  account  of  obstacles  or  an  intellect 
which  is  darkened  or  fame  tarnished  by  calumny. 

Distracted  by  her  separation  from  Rama,  tormented  by  the 
presence  of  the  female  titans,  her  eyes,  like  a  young  doe's 
ranged  here  and  there  searching  everywhere  in  her  distress. 
Tears  streamed  from  her  eyes  with  their  arched  brows  and  dark 
lashes  and,  her  features  altered,  she  sighed  again  and  again. 
That  unfortunate  one,  worthy  of  every  decoration,  now  bereft 
of  all,  covered  with  stains,  resembled  the  King  of  the  Stars 
obscured  by  heavy  cloud.  Beholding  Sita  in  that  pitiable 
state,  Hanuman  was  perplexed  as  one  whose  learning  is  lost 
for  lack  of  sustained  endeavour  and,  seeing  her  without  ornaments, 
he  recognised  her  with  difficulty  as  a  text  that  is  wrongly 
construed.  Beholding  that  large-eyed  and  irreproachable 
princess,  Hanuman  concluded  from  her  many  distinctive 
characteristics  that  it  must  indeed  be  Sita. 

Perceiving  on  her  person  such  ornaments  as  had  been 
374 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

described  by  Rama  at  the  time  of  his  departure,  such  as  the 
Svadangstras  and  jewelled  armlets,  which  were  now  darkened 
by  dust  and  neglect,  nevertheless,  they  appeared  to  Hanuman 
to  be  those  mentioned  to  him  and  he  reflected : — "  Those 
which  were  cast  off  by  Sita  on  the  way,  I  do  not  see  but  those 
she  preserved  are  certainly  here. 

"  The  rich  silken  mantle  shining  like  Kanaka  gold,  which  she 
let  fall,  was  found  by  the  monkeys  caught  in  a  tree  and  the 
valuable  ornaments  cast  off  by  her  fell  on  the  earth  with  a 
tinkling  sound.  The  robe  she  now  wears  is  exceedingly  worn 
but  its  colour  remains  and  resembles  her  own  radiance.  Here 
is  the  one  for  whom  Rama  has  suffered  torment  through 
affection,  pity,  grief  and  love :  through  affection  in  con- 
sequence of  bis  beloved  spouse  being  borne  away ;  through 
pity,  by  his  inability  to  protect  her  who  is  dependent  on  him  ; 
through  grief,  at  her  loss,  and  through  love  by  his  separation 
from  her.  Verily  from  the  grace  of  her  person  and  her  beauty, 
that  resembles  his,  this  lady  of  dark  eyes  must  be  his  spouse. 

She  has  her  mind  fixed  on  him,  and  he  on  her,  it  is  on  account 
of  this  that  they  are  able  to  survive.  Indeed  the  Lord  Rama 
has  achieved  a  great  feat  by  still  existing  separated  from  her 
and  not  yielding  up  his  life  in  grief." 

Having  beheld  Sita,  the  Son  of  Pavana  allowed  his 
thoughts  to  fly  to  Rama,  to  whom  he  silently  offered  obeisance, 
and  to  that  princess  also. 


CHAPTER     16 

Hanuman's  Reflections  on  seeing  Sita 

Having  offered  obeisance  to  Sita  who  was  worthy  of  homage, 
and  also  to  Rama  of  gentle  conduct,  that  bull  among  monkeys 
became  absorbed  in  thought  once  more. 

Reflecting  awhile,  his  eyes  full  of  tears  on  account  of  Sita, 
that  sagacious  monkey,  Hanuman,  gave  voice  to  his  distress 
in  the  following  words : — 

"  None  can  withstand  the  force  of  destiny,  since  Sita,  the 
consort  of  the  illustrious  brother  of  Lakshmana  ever  obedient 
375 


THE    RAM'AYANA    OF    VALMIK^I 

to  his  preceptors,  has  met  with  this  misfortune.  Conversant 
with  the  prowess  of  Kama  and  the  sagacious  Lakshmana, 
that  divine  lady  is  no  more  perturbed  than  is  the  Ganges  at 
the  approach  of  the  rainy  season.  In  character,  age,  conduct 
and  family,  they  are  equal  and  Raghava  is  worthy  of  Vaidehi, 
that  one  of  dark  eyes,  who  is  his." 

Seeing  Sita,  radiant  as  newly  minted  gold  and  who  resembled 
Lakshmi  beloved  of  the  worlds,  Hanuman  approaching  Rama 
in  thought,  said : — 

"  On  account  of  this  large-eyed  lady,  the  mighty  Bali  was 
slain,  and  Kabanda,  equal  to  him  in  strength ;  for  her,  the 
mighty  demon  Viradha,  despite  his  renowned  prowess,  also 
succumbed  in  the  forest  under  the  thrusts  of  the  valiant  Rama, 
as  Shambara  under  Mahendra's  blows.  It  was  for  her  that 
fourteen  thousand  demons  of  outstanding  exploits  were  pierced 
by  Rama's  arrows  resembling  tongues  of  fire  in  Janasthana. 
Khara  too  was  brought  low  on  the  field  of  battle ;  Trishiras 
was  overthrown  and  the  mighty  Dushana  also  by  the  righteous 
Raghava.  And  it  was  on  her  account  that  that  supreme  and 
inaccessible  kingdom  of  the  monkeys  belonging  to  Bah  was 
acquired  by  Sugriva,  renowned  in  the  Three  Worlds ;  it  is 
for  this  large-eyed  damsel,  that  the  effulgent  Lord  of  the 
Waters  has  been  crossed  by  me  and  this  city  explored.  Me- 
thinks  that  if  Rama  had  turned  the  whole  earth,  with  its  boun- 
daries, upside  down  for  her  sake,  it  were  fitting !  Were  the 
dominion  of  the  Three  Worlds  on  one  side  and  Sita,  born  of 
Janaka,  on  the  other,  the  former  would  not  equal  a  fraction  of 
the  latter ;  such  is  the  virtuous  daughter  of  the  magnanimous 
King  of  Mithila,  who  is  wholly  devoted  to  her  lord.  She, 
as  a  field  was  being  dug,  rose  from  a  furrow  which  the  blade 
of  the  plough  had  turned,  covered  with  dust  which  gleamed 
like  the  pollen  of  a  lotus ;  she,  the  eldest  daughter-in-law  of 
King  Dasaratha,  who  was  full  of  courage  and  nobility  and 
was  never  known  to  retreat  in  battle ;  she,  the  beloved  consort 
of  the  faithful  and  dutiful  Rama,  knower  of  his  own  Self,  is 
now  in  the  power  of  the  titans. 

"  Renouncing  every  pleasure,  actuated  by  love  of  her  lord, 
disregarding  the  inevitable  privations,  she  entered  the  beautiful 
forest  to  live  on  fruit  and  roots,  ever  engaged  in  the  service  of 
376 


SU4N£DARA    KANDA 

her  spouse  and  considered  herself  to  have  attained  the  peak 
of  felicity  there,  as  if  it  were  the  palace  itself.  This  lady, 
whose  limbs  resemble  Kanaka  gold  and  who  was  ever  wont 
to  smile  when  conversing,  now  suffers  unimaginable  woes  and 
Raghava,  like  a  thirsty  man  panting  for  a  stream,  sighs  for 
the  sight  of  that  noble  woman  oppressed  by  Ravana.  Re- 
united with  her,  Raghava  will  enjoy  felicity  once  more,  as  a 
king  who  has  been  deprived  of  his  throne  rejoices  on  regaining  it. 

"  Deprived  of  all  comfort  and  pleasure,  far  from  her  kinsmen, 
she  preserves  her  life  in  the  hope  of  seeing  Rama  and  being  re- 
united with  him.  Oblivious  of  the  titans  and  the  trees  covered 
with  fruit  and  flowers,  her  spirit  is  wholly  absorbed  in  the 
thought  of  Rama.  For  a  woman  the  greatest  decoration  is 
her  lord  and  Sita,  though  incomparably  beautiful,  no  longer 
shines  in  Rama's  absence.  It  is  only  Rama's  heroism  that 
makes  it  possible  for  him  to  continue  living  separated  from 
his  consort  and  prevents  him  from  being  overwhelmed  with  grief. 
This  lady  of  dark  eyes,  resembling  the  moonlight,  worthy  of 
happiness,  is  now  utterly  wretched  and  my  heart  is  troubled. 
Patient  as  the  earth,  this  lady  whose  eyes  resemble  lotuses, 
who  was  formerly  protected  by  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  lying 
at  the  foot  of  a  tree,  is  being  guarded  by  demons  of  hideous 
aspect.  Like  a  waterlily  snapped  by  the  frost,  the  daughter 
of  Janaka,  her  beauty  faded,  is  fainting  under  the  rain  of 
misfortunes  and,  like  a  doe  separated  from  the  herd,  is  fallen 
into  this  distress.  The  Ashoka  trees  with  their  boughs  bend- 
ing under  the  weight  of  their  blossom  seem  to  increase  her 
grief,  as  also  the  moon  of  pure  beams  that  is  rising  in  this 
spring  season." 

Reflecting  thus,  that  valiant  monkey,  being  convinced  that 
it  was  Sita,  stationed  himself  in  the  Shingshapa  tree.

Then  the  moon,  pure  as  a  waterlily,  rose  in  the  stainless  heavens, 

sailing  through  the  firmament  like  a  swan  floating  on  blue  waters.

As  if  to  aid  him  with  her  light,  that  pure  and  clear  orb  covered 
the  Son  of  Pavana  with  her  cool  rays. 

Thereupon  that  monkey  beheld  Sita  endowed  with  a  moon- 
like countenance  who,  under  the  load  of  grief,  resembled  a 
heavily  laden  ship  foundering  in  the  waves.  And  gazing  on 
Vaidehi,  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta,  observed  a  number  of 
grim-visaged  titan  women  at  a  distance,  some  with  but  a 
single  eye  or  ear,  some  with  ears  concealing  their  visage,  some 
without  ears,  some  with  noses  on  their  foreheads,  some 
possessed  of  disproportionately  large  heads  and  long  necks, 
some  with  sparse  hair  and  others  covered  with  hair  so  that 
they  appeared  to  be  wrapped  in  a  woollen  cloth ;  the  ears  and 
brows  of  some  were  set  low,  and  their  breasts  and  bellies 
protruded ;  others  were  knock-kneed,  stunted,  humpbacked, 
crooked,  dwarfed,  unkempt,  their  mouths  set  awry,  their  eyes 
inflamed,  their  faces  fearful  to  behold  Hideous,  irascible, 
quarrelsome,  they  were  armed  with  spears,  darts,  hammers 
and  mallets  and  some  had  snouts  like  bears  or  the  muzzles  of 
deer  or  the  faces  of  tigers,  camels,  buffalo,  goats  and  jackals 
and  some  had  the  feet  of  elephants,  camels,  horses  and  the 
heads  of  some  were  sunk  in  their  breasts. 

Some  had  a  single  hand  or  foot,  some  the  ears  of  asses, 
horses,  kjne  and  elephants  or  some  the  ears  of  monkeys.  Some 
had  enormous  noses,  some  crooked  noses  and  some  none  at  all, 
some  had  noses  like  the  trunks  of  elephants,  some  had  their 
noses  fixed  in  their  foreheads,  through  which  they  breathed 
like  beasts.  The  feet  of  some  were  like  elephants  and  some 
had  the  feet  of  kine,  some  were  hairy ;  some  had  huge  heads, 
gigantic  faces  and  long  tongues  ;  some  had  the  heads  of  goats, 
elephants,  cows,  pigs,  horses,  camels  and  donkeys. 

These  titan  women  of  formidable  appearance  held  spears 
and  maces  in  their  hands,  they  were  ill-humoured  and  rejoiced 
in  discord.  Their  hair  was  black  as  soot  or  smoke-coloured, 
their  aspect  repellant  and  they  feasted  continually,  regaling 
themselves  on  wine  and  meat  without  surcease,  their  bodies 
being  spattered  with  blood  from  the  flesh  they  consumed. 

That  foremost  of  monkeys  surveyed  those  titan  women 
whose  appearance  caused  his  hair  to  stand  on  end  and  who 
were  seated  in  a  circle  round  the  many-branched  tree  under 
378 


sun;dara  kanda 

which  the  divine  and  irreproachable  Janaki  stood.  And  the 
graceful  Hanuman  beheld  that  daughter  of  Janaka  bereft  of 
her  radiance,  consumed  with  grief,  her  locks  soiled  with  dust, 
like  a  star  which  has  fallen  on  the  earth  its  merits  exhausted, 
Sita,  famed  throughout  the  worlds  for  her  fidelity,  yet  with 
little  hope  of  being  re-united  with  her  lord. 

Stripped  of  her  jewels,  she  whose  chief  ornament  was  her 
devotion  to  her  lord,  held  captive  by  Ravana,  appeared  like  a 
female  elephant  separated  from  the  herd  who  has  been  attacked 
by  a  lion  or  like  the  moonlight  enveloped  in  cloud  at  the 
end  of  the  rainy  season.  Her  beauty  dimmed,  she  resembled 
a  stringed  instrument  that  one  has  ceased  to  pluck  and  has  laid 
aside.  Far  from  her  lord,  that  illustrious  one  had  fallen  under 
the  sway  of  the  titans  without  having  merited  it.  Sunk  in 
an  ocean  of  grief,  surrounded  by  those  titan  women  in  the 
midst  of  the  Ashoka  Grove,  she  looked  like  Rohini  about  to 
be  devoured  by  Rahu  and,  beholding  her  there,  Hanuman 
thought  she  resembled  a  creeper  divested  of  its  blooms. 
Having  lost  her  radiance,  her  limbs  covered  with  dust,  with 
her  hidden  grace  she  looked  like  a  lotus  spattered  with  mud. 

The  monkey,  Hanuman,  beheld  that  youthful  woman,  whose 
eyes  resembled  a  doe's,  clothed  in  a  soiled  and  tattered  cloth 
and  though  that  blessed  one  was  shorn  of  her  beauty,  yet  her 
soul  did  not  lose  its  transcendency,  upheld  as  it  was  by  the 
thought  of  Rama's  glory  and  safeguarded  by  her  own  virtue. 

Beholding  Sita,  whose  eyes,  wide  with  fear,  resembled  a 
doe's,  casting  her  glances  here  and  there  like  a  fawn  and  con- 
suming the  trees  and  their  leaves  with  her  sighs,  like  a  moun- 
tainous wave  rising  from  the  ocean  of  adversity,  incomparably 
beautiful  with  her  slender  limbs  and  graceful  form,  bereft  of 
ornaments,  Maruti  experienced  a  great  felicity ;  and  Hanuman 
wept  tears  of  joy  at  this  fortunate  meeting  and  silendy  offered 
obeisance  to  Rama. 

Having  bowed  down  to  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  the  valiant 
Hanuman,  filled  with  happiness  on  having  beheld  Sita,  remained 
there  wholly  concealed.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 
CHAPTER    18 

Ravana  goes  to  the  Ashoka  Grove 

Surveying  the  woods  filled  with  flowering  trees,  desirous  of 
beholding  Sita  closely  and  the  night  being  almost  spent,  towards 
dawn,  Hanuman  heard  the  chanting  of  the  Vedas  by  those 
among  the  titans  conversant  with  the  holy  Shastras  and  the 
six  supplementary  portions.1 

Then  the  mighty  ten-headed  Lord  of  the  Titans  awoke  to 
the  sound  of  auspicious  music,  delightful  to  the  ear  and, 
waking,  that  great  and  powerful  king,  his  garlands  and  attire 
in  disarray,  remembered  Vaidehi.  Passionately  enamoured  of 
her,  that  titan  filled  with  pride  could  not  restrain  his  desire. 

Thereupon,  adorned  with  every  kind  of  ornament,  gor- 
geously robed,  he  entered  the  Ashoka  Grove  filled  with  in- 
numerable trees,  laden  with  fruit  and  flowers  of  every  kind 
with  pools  embellished  with  lotuses  and  lilies,  enlivened  by 
birds  of  rare  beauty  ecstatic  with  love  and  sculptured  wolves 
wonderful  to  behold. 

Dashagriva  gazed  on  those  avenues  with  their  arches  of  gold 
and  gems,  thronged  with  deer  of  every  sort  and  carpeted  with 
the  fruit  that  had  fallen  on  the  earth.  And  one  hundred 
damsels,  daughters  of  the  Gods  and  Gandharvas,  followed  in 
the  train  of  the  son  of  Poulastya,  resembling  the  nymphs  who 
follow  Mahendra  and  some  carried  lamps  of  gold  whilst 
others  bore  chanwaras  and  tans  in  their  hands.  Some  carrying 
water  in  golden  ewers,  walked  ahead,  others  following  with  a 
golden  seat  and  round  cushions  and  one  on  his  right  bore 
a  cup  encrusted  with  gems  and  filled  with  wine  whilst  another 
carried  a  canopy  resembling  a  swan,  golden-ribbed  like  the 
moon  and  having  a  handle  of  fine  gold. 

In  this  way,  the  most  beautiful  of  Ravana's  wives,  their  eyes 
heavy  with  sleep  and  wine  followed  their  august  lord  like 

'  Grammer,  Prosody,  Astronomy,  Pronunciation,  the  meaning  of  un- 
usual terms  and  Ritual.

flashes  of  lightning  following  a  cloud.  Their  bracelets  and 
necklets  of  pearl,  swung  to  and  fro,  their  sandal-paste  was 
effaced  and  their  hair  hung  loose  while  drops  of  perspiration 
stood  on  the  brows  of  those  women  of  lovely  mien  who  stumbled 
on  account  of  the  effects  of  wine  and  sleep,  and  the  sweat  had 
caused  the  flowers  that  adorned  them  to  wither  and  their 
locks  were  full  of  shreds  from  their  garlands  j  in  this  way, 
those  women  of  tender  appearance  full  of  pride  and  affection, 
followed  the  King  of  the  Titans. 

And  that  powerful  lord,  the  slave  of  his  desires,  his  heart 
fixed  on  Sita,  proceeded  at  a  slow  pace. 

Then  the  monkey  heard  the  sound  of  the  bells  on  the  women's 
girdles  and  anklets,  and  the  joy  of  Maruta  beheld  Ravana  of 
inconceivable  prowess,  whose  energy  and  valour  were  un- 
imaginable, as  he  entered  the  gate ;  and  he  was  illumined  on 
all  sides  by  the  innumerable  lamps,  fed  with  fragrant  oil, 
which  were  carried  by  those  damsels  and,  intoxicated  with 
pride,  desire  and  wine,  his  eyes  of  a  coppery  red,  he  looked 
like  Kandarpa  himself  bereft  of  his  bow.  He  adjusted  his 
magnificent  cloak,  decorated  with  flowers,  stainless  as  the  foam  of 
Amrita  when  churned,  and  which  flung  back  was  held  by  a  clasp. 

Hanuman,  concealed  behind  the  curtain  of  leafy  branches, 
stared  at  him  as  he  approached  and  from  his  hiding  place, 
that  elephant  among  monkeys  beheld  that  mighty  king,  Ravana, 
surrounded  by  beautiful  and  youthful  brides,  with  majestic 
strides  enter  that  grove,  which  re-echoed  to  the  cry  of  deer 
and  birds.  Already  intoxicated,  adorned  with  priceless  orna- 
ments, possessing  pointed  ears  resembling  darts,  full  of  energy, 
that  Son  of  Vaishravas,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  appeared  sur- 
rounded by  lovely  women,  as  the  moon  amidst  the  stars,  and 
that  illustrious  monkey,  beholding  him,  reflected : — 

"  This  is  the  long-armed  Ravana  who  was  formerly  sleeping 
in  that  sumptuous  apartment  in  the  centre  of  the  city." 

Then  the  valiant  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta,  despite  his 
great  courage  and  though  highly  effulgent,  found  himself  eclipsed 
by  Ravana's  glory  and  effaced  himself  among  the  leafy  branches. 
Ravana  however,  eager  to  see  that  dark-eyed  Sita  of  faultless 
limbs,  whose  breasts  touched  each  other,  and  whose  tresses 
were  black,  strode  on.

CHAPTER     19 

Sita's  Grief 

Beholding  Havana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  endowed  with 
youth  and  beauty,  wearing  gorgeous  raiment  and  priceless 
jewels,  that  irreproachable  princess  trembled  like  a  palm 
agitated  by  the  wind  and,  covering  her  breasts  and  belly  with 
her  hands,  seeking  to  conceal  them,  shrank  away. 

Dashagriva  gazed  on  Vaidehi,  who  was  guarded  by  com- 
panies of  female  titans  and  that  unfortunate  One,  given  over 
to  grief,  resembled  a  ship  foundering  in  the  sea. 

Seated  on  the  naked  ground,  Sita  who  was  fixed  in  virtue, 
resembled  a  branch  severed  from  a  tree  that  has  fallen  to  earth. 
Her  limbs  covered  with  a  soiled  cloth,  she,  who  was  worthy  of 
ornaments,  now  no  longer  adorned,  resembled  a  lotus  stalk 
stained  with  mud  and,  though  radiant,  her  beauty  was  dimmed. 

In  imagination,  she  took  refuge  with  that  lion  among  men, 
Rama,  her  mind  a  chariot  drawn  by  the  steeds  of  resolution 
and  that  charming  princess,  devoted  to  Rama,  emaciated, 
weeping,  separated  from  her  kinsfolk,  was  a  prey  to  anxiety 
and  grief  and  saw  no  end  to  her  misfortune.  Rocking  herself 
to  and  fro,  she  resembled  the  female  of  the  King  of  the  Snakes 
under  the  spell  of  an  incantation  or  the  planet  Rohini  pursued 
by  Dhumaketu  or  a  saintly  and  virtuous  woman  of  a  noble 
house  who  finds  herself,  through  marriage,  placed  in  a  low- 
born family.  She  resembled  a  great  reputation  that  has  been 
lost  or  a  faith  that  has  been  disregarded  or  a  mind  that  has 
become  clouded  or  a  hope  destroyed,  a  future  shattered,  an 
order  misinterpreted,  a  region  obliterated  at  the  destruction  of 
the  world  or  an  offering  rejected  by  the  Gods,  a  night  on 
which  the  full  moon  is  obscured  by  clouds  or  a  lotus  pool  laid 
waste,  an  army  bereft  of  its  warriors,  a  moon  under  eclipse, 
a  dried  up  river,  an  altar  which  has  been  desecrated  or  a  flame 
382 


SUNDARA    KANDA 
that  has  been  extinguished  or  a  lotus  pool  bereft  of  flowers, 
its  birds  struck  with  terror  agitated  by  the  trumpeting  of 
elephants. 

In  separation  from  her  lord,  consumed  with  grief,  she 
appeared  like  a  river  whose  waters  have  run  dry  and  on  account 
of  her  limbs  not  having  been  washed,  she  resembled  night 
during  the  period  of  the  waning  moon.  That  lovely  and 
graceful  woman,  accustomed  to  a  palace  rilled  with  precious 
gems,  now,  with  wasted  limbs,  resembled  the  stalk  of  a  lotus 
freshly  plucked  and  wilting  in  the  sun. 

As  the  female  elephant  which  has  been  captured,  chained 
to  a  stake,  grieving  for  its  mate,  sighs  again  and  again,  so 
seemed  she.  Her  long  dark  tresses,  utterly  neglected,  lay 
along  her  back  so  that  she  appeared  like  the  earth  covered 
with  a  dark  forest  at  the  end  of  the  rainy  season.  Tortured 
by  hunger,  sorrow,  anxiety  and  fear,  emaciated,  desolate, 
weakened  by  abstinence  and  given  over  to  austerity,  stricken 
with  grief,  resembling  a  goddess,  her  hands  were  joined 
offering  prayers  to  Rama  for  the  destruction  of  Ravana. 

And  beholding  that  blameless  Maithili  with  her  beautiful 
dark  eyes  and  graceful  lashes,  Ravana,  to  his  own  destruction, 
sought  to  seduce  her. 


CHAPTER     20 

Ravana  begs  Sita  to  iced  him 

Thereupon  Ravana  approaching  Sita,  who  was  helpless,  sur- 
rounded by  female  titans  and  vowed  to  a  life  of  austerity,  with 
sweet  words  and  courteous  gestures  said  to  her  : — 

"  O  Thou  whose  thighs  resemble  the  trunk  of  an  elephant, 
who,  beholding  me  dost  seek  to  conceal  thy  breasts  and  thy 
body  as  if  thou  didst  fear  me,  O  Lady  of  large  eyes,  I  love 
thee.  Be  gracious  to  me,  O  Thou  of  charming  looks,  who  art 
adored  by  all  the  world  I  There  is  no  man  present  here  nor 
any  titan  able  to  change  his  form  at  will  therefore  banish  the 
fear  which  I  inspire  in  thee,  O  Sita. 
383 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  It  has  ever  been  the  unquestioned  and  special  privilege  of 
titans  to  unite  themselves  with  the  wives  of  others,  either 
taking  them  of  their  own  free  will  or  bearing  them  away  by 
force.  In  spite  of  this,  O  Maithili,  I  shall  not  lay  hands  on 
thee  since  thou  hast  no  affection  for  me  but,  for  myself,  I  am 
completely  under  thy  sway,  therefore  trust  in  me  and  respond 
to  my  love.  O  Goddess,  have  no  fear  of  me,  take  courage, 
O  Dear  One,  and  do  not  let  thyself  be  consumed  with  grief. 
To  wear  but  a  single  plait,  to  lie  on  the  earth  in  soiled  attire 
and  fast  unnecessarily  does  not  become  thee.  In  my  company, 
O  Maithili,  do  thou  enjoy  garlands,  perfumes,  sandal,  orna- 
ments, wine,  rich  beds  and  seats,  singing,  dancing  and  music. 
Thou  art  a  pearl  among  women,  do  not  remain  in  this  condi- 
tion, adorn  thyself  as  heretofore.  Having  united  thyself  with 
me,  O  Lady  of  Lovely  Form,  what  will  not  be  thine  ? 

"  Thine  enchanting  youth  is  passing  away,  which  like  the 
water  of  a  river,  once  gone,  does  not  return.  O  Thou  of 
Fair  Looks,  the  creator  of  thy  loveliness,  Vishvakrita,  after 
devising  thee,  ceased  from  his  work  for  I  see  none  who  is 
equal  to  thee  in  loveliness  and  grace !  Who,  having  seen  thee, 
resplendent  with  beauty,  could  withstand  thee  O  Vaidehi  ? 
Even  Brahma  Himself  is  moved,  how  much  more  other  beings  ? 
O  Thou  whose  countenance  resembles  the  moon,  on  whatever 
part  of  thy  body  mine  eyes  rest,  my  gaze  is  riveted.  O  Maithili, 
do  thou  become  my  consort  and  renounce  this  thy  folly.  Be- 
come the  foremost  queenof  these  innumerable  andlovelywomen 
who  belong  to  me.  O  Timid  One,  all  the  treasure  I  have 
won  throughout  the  worlds  I  offer  thee  as  also  my  kingdom. 
O  Sportive  Damsel,  for  thy  sake,  having  subjugated  the  entire 
earth  with  its  many  cities,  I  will  confer  them  on  King  Janaka. 
None  on  this  earth  can  withstand  my  prowess ;  behold  mine 
immeasurable  valour  in  battle !  Did  not  the  Celestials  and  the 
Demons  find  me  irresistible  on  the  battlefield  as  I  broke 
through  their  ranks  shattering  their  standards  ? 

"  Therefore  yield  to  my  desire  and  attire  thyself  in  splendid 
robes,  letting  brilliant  gems  adorn  thy  person.  O  Timid  One, 
enjoy  every  comfort  and  luxury  according  to  thy  pleasure, 
divert  thyself  and  distribute  land  and  treasure  to  others.  Live 
happily  depending  on  my  support  and  exercise  supreme

authority.  By  my  favour,  all  thy  relatives  shall  share  thy 
felicity.  Observe  my  prosperity  and  glory,  O  Gentle  Lady, 
what  canst  thou  hope  from  Rama  who  is  clothed  in  robes  of 
bark?  O  Fortunate  One,  Rama  has  been  deprived  of  his 
kingdom  and  is  bereft  of  his  might,  he  practises  asceticism, 
his  couch  is  the  bare  earth,  indeed  it  is  doubtful  whether  he 
still  lives.  O  Vaidehi,  Rama  will  never  be  able  to  find  thee, 
thou  who  resemblest  a  star  veiled  by  dark  clouds  preceded 
by  cranes.  Raghava  will  never  rescue  thee  from  my  hands, 
as  Hiranyakashipu  was  not  able  to  recover  his  consort  Kirti, 
who  had  fallen  under  the  sway  of  Indra. 

"  O  Lady  of  Sweet  Smiles,  O  Thou  of  lovely  teeth  and 
beautiful  eyes,  thou  dost  ravish  my  heart  as  Suparna  carried 
away  a  serpent.  Although  thy  robe  is  torn  and  stained  and 
thou  art  stripped  of  ornaments,  seeing  thee,  my  mind  turns 
away  from  all  my  other  consorts.  O  Daughter  of  Janaka,  do 
thou  hold  sway  over  all  the  women  in  my  harem,  who  are 
endowed  with  every  accomplishment.  O  Princess  of  raven 
locks,  these  women,  the  foremost  among  the  beauties  of  the 
world,  shall  be  thy  slaves  and  attend  on  thee  as  the  Apsaras 
attend  on  Shri.  O  Graceful  Princess,  enjoy  the  pleasures  of 
the  world  with  me  and  the  riches  of  Kuvera  to  the  utmost 
of  thy  desires.  O  Goddess,  neither  in  asceticism,  strength, 
prowess,  wealth  nor  fame  is  Rama  equal  to  me.  Therefore 
drink,  eat,  enjoy  thyself  and  indulge  in  every  pleasure.  I 
shall  confer  on  thee  immense  wealth,  nay,  the  whole  world. 

"  Do  thou  satisfy  all  thy  desires  in  my  company,  O  Timid 
One,  and  let  thy  relatives  share  thy  felicity  also.  Adorned 
with  dazzling  golden  bracelets,  O  Beautiful  One,  in  my  com- 
pany range  the  groves  of  flowering  trees  on  the  shores  of  the 
sea  where  the  black  bees  hum." 


CHAPTER    21 

Sita  rejects  Havana's  Advances  with  disdain 

Hearing  the  words  of  that  terrible  titan,  Sita,  overwhelmed 

with  grief,  answered  in  a  faint  and  feeble  voice.    The  un- 

385 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

fortunate  Sita,  afflicted  and  trembling,  faithful  to  her  lord  and 
anxious  to  preserve  her  virtue,  her  heart  fixed  on  Rama,  placed 
a  straw  between  Ravana  and  herself  and  with  a  sweet  smile 
answered  him,  saying : — 

"  Take  bade  thy  heart  and  set  it  on  thine  own  consorts. 
As  a  sinner  may  not  aspire  to  heaven,  so  shouldst  thou  not 
expect  to  win  me.  That  which  should  never  be  done  and  is 
condemned  in  a  woman  faithful  to  her  lord,  I  shall  never  do. 
Born  in  a  noble  House,  I  have  been  joined  to  a  pious  family." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Ravana,  the  virtuous  Vaidehi,  turning 
her  back  on  him,  continued  : — 

"  It  is  not  meet  that  I  become  thy  wife  since  I  am  united 
to  another.  Do  thy  duty  and  follow  the  rules  laid  down  by 
men  of  integrity.  The  wives  of  others,  like  thine  own,  are 
deserving  of  protection,  O  Prowler  of  the  Night.  Do  thou 
furnish  a  good  example  and  enjoy  thine  own  consorts.  That 
wretch  who,  in  the  inconstancy  and  levity  of  his  heart,  is  not 
satisfied  with  his  own  wives,  will  be  brought  to  misery  by  those 
of  others.  Either  no  pious  men  exist  here  or  thou  dost  not 
follow  their  example,  since  thy  mind  is  perverse  and  turns 
from  what  is  virtuous;  or  the  wise  having  uttered  sage  counsel, 
thou,  to  the  destruction  of  the  titans,  dost  ignore  them. 

"  Prosperity,  kingdom  and  city  are  all  brought  to  nought 
in  the  hands  of  a  vicious  monarch  who  is  not  master  of  himself, 
hence  Lanka,  overflowing  with  treasure,  having  thee  for  her 
king,  will  suffer  destruction  'ere  long.  O  Ravana,  that  wicked 
being  who  brings  about  his  own  downfall,  succumbs,  to  the 
delight  of  all.  When  thou  meetest  with  thine  end,  this  evil 
deed  will  cause  the  oppressed  to  say  :  '  Fortunate  are  we  that 
this  great  tyrant  has  fallen.' 

"  Thou  art  not  able  to  tempt  me  with  wealth  and  riches ; 
as  the  light  of  the  sun  cannot  be  separated  from  the  sun  so 
do  I  belong  to  Raghava.  Having  rested  on  the  arm  of  that 
Lord  of  Men,  how  should  I  depend  on  any  other  ?  Like  unto 
the  spiritual  truth  known  to  a  brahmin  faithful  to  his  vows, 
I  belong  to  the  Lord  of  the  World  alone  and  am  lawfully 
wedded  to  him.  It  is  to  thine  own  advantage  to  restore  me  to 
Rama,  wretched  as  I  am,  like  unto  a  she-elephant  anxiously  await- 
ing her  mate  in  the  forest.  It  behoveth  thee  to  seek  Rama's 
386 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

friendship,  that  lion  among  men,  if  thou  desireth  to  preserve 
Lanka  and  dost  not  wish  to  bring  about  thine  own  destruction. 
He  is  wise,  conversant  with  every  duty  and  ever  eager  to  serve 
those  who  seek  his  protection ;  form  an  alliance  with  him  if 
thou  desirest  to  survive.  Seek  to  conciliate  Rama,  who  is 
full  of  devotion  to  those  who  take  refuge  in  him  and  humbly 
conduct  me  to  him  once  more.  If  thou  dost  bring  me  back 
to  the  greatest  of  the  Raghus,  thy  well-being  is  assured  but 
if  thou  dost  act  otherwise  thou  art  doomed.  Thou  mayest 
evade  the  thunderbolt  of  Indra,  even  death  himself  may  over- 
look thee  but  there  will  be  no  refuge  for  thee  from  the  fury  of 
Raghava,  that  lord  of  men,  when  thou  dost  hear  the  terrible 
twanging  of  Rama's  bow  resembling  the  thunderbolt  hurled 
by  Indra.  Soon  shall  those  arrows,  bearing  the  impress  of 
Rama  and  Lakshmana,  like  serpents  with  flaming  jaws,  penetrate 
Lanka  and  those  shafts,  decorated  with  heron's  plumes,  shall 
cover  the  whole  city  annihilating  the  titans.  As  Vainateya 
bears  away  great  reptiles,  so  shall  that  eagle,  Rama,  speedily 
bear  away  the  titans. 

"  And  like  unto  Vishnu  wresting  the  radiant  Shri  from  the 
Asuras  by  covering  the  worlds  in  three  strides,  so  shall  my 
lord,  the  destroyer  of  his  foes,  recover  me  from  thee. 

"  This  cowardly  deed  has  been  perpetrated  by  thee  in  order 
to  revenge  thyself  for  the  destruction  of  Janasthana  and  the 
hosts  of  the  titans.  In  the  absence  of  these  two  brothers, 
those  lions  among  men  who  had  gone  forth  hunting,  didst 
thou  carry  me  away,  O  Vile  Wretch ;  but,  dog  that  thou  art, 
thou  didst  not  dare  stand  before  those  tigers,  Rama  and 
Lakshmana  !  Wealth  and  friends  will  be  of  no  avail  to  thee 
in  conflict  with  them  and  thou  shalt  be  defeated  as  the  one- 
handed  Vritra  who  entered  into  combat  with  the  two-handed 
Indra. 

"  Soon  shall  my  protector,  Rama,  accompanied  by  Saumitri, 
draw  out  thy  life's  breaths,  as  the  sun  with  its  rays  dries  up 
shallow  water. 

Whether  thou  takest  refuge  in  the  abode  of  Kuvera  or 
terrified,  descendest  into  Varuna's  realm,  thou  shalt  assuredly 
perish,  struck  down  by  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  like  a  mighty 
tree  felled  by  lightning.*'

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    22 

Ravana's  Threats 

To  this  stern  speech  from  the  gracious  Sita,  the  King  of  the 

Titans  replied  harshly  :— 

"  In  the  world  it  is  said  the  more  gentleness  one  manifests 
towards  a  woman,  the  more  responsive  she  becomes,  but  the 
more  kindness  I  show  to  thee  the  more  thou  dost  repulse  me. 
Verily  only  the  love  I  bear  thee  restrains  my  wrath,  as  a  skilful 
charioteer  controls  the  horses  who  seek  to  leave  the  road. 
Mighty  indeed  is  the  power  of  love,  for  even  if  the  object  of 
his  affection  invoke  his  anger,  man  covers  her  with  pity  and 
tenderness.  It  is  on  this  account,  O  Lady  of  lovely  mien, 
that  I  do  not  slay  thee,  thou  dost  merit  death  and  dishonour, 
thou  who  delightest  in  asceticism  without  reason.  For  each 
and  every  harsh  word  which  thou  hast  addressed  to  me,  thou 
meritest  a  dreadful  end,  O  Maithili." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Sita,  the  Princess  of  Videha,  Ravana, 
Lord  of  the  Titans,  filled  with  indignation,  added  : — "  I  shall 
grant  thee  two  months  as  the  term  assigned  to  thee,  after 
which  thou  must  share  my  bed.  If  thou  should'st  refuse,  my 
cooks  shall  mince  thy  limbs  for  my  morning  repast." 

Hearing  these  threats  addressed  by  the  King  of  the  Titans 
to  Janaki,  the  daughters  01  the  Gods  and  Gandharvas  were 
exceedingly  perturbed  and,  by  the  expression  of  their  lips  and 
eyes  and  their  gestures  sought  to  reassure  Sita  thus  menaced 
by  him. 

Encouraged  by  them,  Sita,  fortified  by  her  virtue  and  her 
pride  in  Rama,  addressed  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  in 
his  own  interests,  saying  : — 

"  It  appears  that  there  is  none  in  this  city  who  desires  thy 
welfare  and  therefore  seeks  to  prevent  thee  from  this  despicable 
deed.  Who  in  the  Three  Worlds  would  desire  to  possess  the 
chaste  consort  of  the  high-souled  One,  who  resembles  Indra's 
Sachi  ?  O  Vilest  of  Demons,  how  wilt  thou  escape  the  con- 
388 


SUKDARA    KANDA 

sequences  of  this  insult  offered  to  Rama's  consort,  he  whose 
valour  is  immeasurable?  Like  unto  an  infuriated  elephant, 
encountering  a  hare  in  the  forest,  so  shah  thou,  the  wretched 
hare,  meet  with  that  elephant  Rama.  Thou  dost  not  fear  to 
rail  at  the  Chief  of  the  Ikshwakus  so  long  as  thou  art  not 
in  his  presence.  Why  do  not  those  cruel,  terrible,  coppery 
eyes  of  thine  fall  out,  looking  on  me  so  lustfully,  O  Ignoble 
Creature  ?  O  Contemptible  Wretch,  when  thou  didst  threaten 
the  spouse  of  that  high-souled  Rama,  the  daughter-in-law  of 
King  Dasaratha,  why  did  not  thy  tongue  dry  up?  O  Ten- 
necked  One,  by  the  power  of  my  asceticism,  I  could  reduce 
thee  to  ashes  instantly  had  I  Rama's  mandate.  On  account 
of  my  consuming  virtue  and  ascetic  observances,  I  could  never 
have  been  wrested  from  Rama,  were  it  not  that  thine  evil  act 
was  to  be  the  cause  of  thy  destruction,  O  Dashagriva  !  Assisted 
by  the  brother  of  Kuvera  and  proud  of  thine  own  heroism, 
thou  didst  lure  Rama  from  the  hermitage  and  succeed  in 
bearing  me  away  by  stealth." 

Hearing  Sita's  words,  Ravana,  the  King  of  the  Titans,  cast 
ferocious  glances  at  her.  Like  a  mass  of  black  clouds,  with 
his  enormous  arms  and  neck,  endowed  with  an  elephantine 
gait,  his  eyes  smouldering,  his  tongue  like  a  darting  name,  of 
immense  stature,  wearing  a  plumed  diadem,  covered  with 
necklaces,  sprinkled  with  perfume,  decked  with  garlands  and, 
bracelets  of  gold,  his  waist  encircled  with  a  dark  blue  belt 
so  that  it  resembled  the  Mandara  mountain  encompassed  by  the 
snake  at  the  time  of  the  churning  of  the  ocean ;  with  his  vast 
arms,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans  looked  like  a  mountain  with 
twin  peaks.  Adorned  with  earrings  gleaming  like  the  rising 
sun,  he  resembled  a  hill  between  two  Ashoka  trees  enveloped 
in  crimson  flowers  and  buds  or  like  the  wish-fulfilling  tree  or 
spring  incarnate  or  an  altar  in  a  crematorium. 

Then  Ravana  cast  furious  glances  from  his  bloodshot  eyes 
at  the  Princess  of  Videha  and,  hissing  like  a  serpent,  addressed 
her,  saying : — "  O  Thou  who  art  attached  to  that  wretch 
without  resource  or  moral  sense,  I  shall  destroy  thee  to-day 
as  the  sun*s  radiance  is  obliterated  at  the  time  of  dusk." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Maithili,  Ravana,  the  oppressor  of 
his  foes,  looked  at  those  female  titans  of  formidable  appearance, 
389 


the   RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

some  of  whom  had  a  single  eye  or  car,  some  enormous  ears 
and  some  the  ears  of  kine  or  elephants.  Some  had  ears 
that  hung  down  and  some  none  at  all,  some  had  the  feet  of 
elephants,  some  of  horses,  some  of  kine,  some  were  hairy, 
others  possessed  but  a  single  eye  and  foot,  some  had  enormous 
feet  and  others  none  at  all.  Some  had  heads  and  necks  of 
inordinate  size,  some  enormous  chests  and  bellies,  some  dis- 
proportionately large  mouths  and  eyes  or  long  tongues  and 
nails  and  some  had  no  nose  or  possessed  jaws  like  lions,  some 
had  mouths  like  oxen  or  snouts  like  pigs. 

Then  Ravana,  transfiixing  those  titans  with  his  glance,  said 
to  them : — "  Ye  Titans  seek  by  fair  or  foul  means,  by  threats 
or  persuasion  or  honeyed  words  or  gifts  to  induce  Sita  to 
look  on  me  with  favour." 

Repeating  his  command  again  and  again,  the  King  of  the 
Titans  filled  with  desire  and  anger  began  to  inveigh  against 
Janaki,  whereupon  a  female  titan  named  Dhanyamalini, 
approaching  Dashagriva,  embraced  him  and  said :-— 

"  O  Great  King,  enjoy  thyself  with  me,  what  need  hast 
thou  for  this  human  being  who  is  wretched  and  whose  counten- 
ance is  pale  ?  O  King  of  the  Titans,  it  is  not  with  her  that 
the  Gods  have  destined  thee  to  taste  the  exquisite  pleasures 
that  are  the  reward  of  the  strength  of  thine  arms.  He  who 
loves  one  who  is  unwilling  exposes  himself  to  torment,  whereas 
he  whose  love  is  reciprocated,  enjoys  perfect  happiness." 

Having  said  this,  the  female  titan  drew  Ravana  away  but  he, 
resembling  a  mass  of  cloud,  turned  back,  laughing  scornfully. 

Then  Dashagriva  strode  away,  causing  the  earth  to  tremble, 
and  returned  to  his  palace  that  shone  with  the  brilliance  of 
the  orb  of  day. 

Surrounding  Ravana,  the  daughters  of  the  Gods  and  Gand- 
harvas  as  well  as  those  of  the  Serpent  Race  returned  to  that 
sumptuous  abode  with  him.  Thus  Ravana,  distracted  with 
desire,  left  the  Princess  of  Mithila  of  irreproachable  virtue 
trembling  and  entered  his  own  dwelling.

CHAPTER     23 

The  Female  Titans  seek  to  persuade  Sita  to  wed  Ravana 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Maithili  and  issued  his  commands  to 
the  titan  women,  Ravana,  the  scourge  of  his  foes,  went  away. 
And  that  Sovereign  of  the  Titans  having  returned  to  his  inner 
apartment,  those  women  of  hideous  appearance  bore  down  on 
Sita  and,  filled  with  ire,  addressed  her  in  harsh  tones,  saying: — 

"  Thou  dost  not  fully  value  an  alliance  with  the  offspring  of 
Poulastya  the  illustrious  Ravana,  the  magnanimous  Dashagriva, 
O  Sita." 

Thereafter,  one  among  them  named  Ekjata,  her  eyes  in- 
flamed with  anger  addressed  Sita  of  small  belly,  saying : — 
"According  to  tradition,  Poulastya  is  the  fourth  of  the  six 
Prajapatis,  a  mind-born  son  of  Brahma  renowned  in  all  the 
world,  O  Sita,  and  that  glorious  Ascetic  Vaishravas  sprang  from 
the  mind  of  that  great  Rishi  whose  glory  equalled  the  Praja- 
patis. O  Large-eyed  Princess,  his  son  was  Ravana,  the  scourge 
of  his  foes;  it  behoveth  thee  to  become  the  consort  of  that 
King  of  Titans.  Why  dost  thou  not  consent,  O  Thou  of 
Lovely  Form  ?  " 

Thereupon  another  titan  called  Harijata,  rolling  her  eyes 
that  resembled  a  cat's,  said  furiously :  "  It  is  for  thee  to 
become  the  wife  of  one  who  defeated  the  thirty-three  Celestials 
and  their  king  in  combat ;  dost  thou  not  desire  to  be  united 
with  him  who  is  heroic,  of  indomitable  prowess  and  never 
turns  back  in  battle  ?  Renouncing  his  cherished  and  beloved 
Queen  Mandodari,  that  mighty  King  Ravana  will  be  thine, 
and  seek  the  gorgeous  inner  apartment,  enriched  by  thousands 
of  women  adorned  with  jewels,  and  thou  wilt  be  the  object  of 
his  worship ! " 

There  followed  another  titan  by  name  Vikata,  who  said : 
"  He  who  again  and  again  triumphs  over  the  Gandharvas, 
Nagas  and  Danavas  by  his  valour  in  battle  has  made  advances 
391 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 
to  thee,  why  dost  thou  not  wish  to  be  the  wife  of  that  illustrious 
Lord  of  Titans,  Ravana,  who  is  endowed  with  riches  ?  " 

Thereafter  the  titan,  Durmukhi  spoke  saying : — "  O  Lady  of 
Lovely  Lashes,  why  dost  thou  not  yield  to  him,  in  fear  of 
whom  the  sun  dares  not  shine  nor  the  wind  blow,  at  whose 
command  the  trees  shower  down  their  blooms  and  the  hills 
and  clouds  loose  their  floods. 

"  O  Beautiful  One,  why  dost  thou  not  consent  to  be  the 
consort  of  that  King  of  kings,  Ravana  ?  We  speak  thus  for 
thy  welfare ;  accede  to  our  request,  O  Goddess  of  Sweet 
Smiles  or  thou  shalt  surely  die."! 


CHAPTER     24 

Their  Menaces 

Thereupon  all  those  titans  of  hideous  appearance,  unitedly 
reproached  Sita  in  harsh  and  unpleasing  words,  saying  : — 

"  Why  dost  thou  not  consent  to  dwell  in  that  inner  apart- 
ment abounding  in  costly  couches  ?  O  Lady,  thou  prizest 
union  with  a  mere  man  ;  dismiss  Rama  from  thy  thoughts  for 
assuredly  thou  wilt  not  see  him  more.  Live  happily  with 
Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans  as  thy  consort  who  owns  the 
treasure  of  the  Three  Worlds.  Thou  art  a  woman,  O  Irre- 
proachable Beauty,  and  for  this  dost  mourn  a  man  who  is 
banished  from  his  kingdom  and  who  leads  a  life  of  misery." 

Hearing  the  words  of  those  titans,  Sita,  her  lotus  eyes  filled 
with  tears,  answered  them,  saying  : — "  What  you  have  uttered 
is  immoral  and  wholly  reprehensible  and  will  never  find 
acceptance  with  me.  A  mortal  woman  may  not  become  the 
wife  of  a  demon.  Devour  me,  if  you  wish,  I  will  never  accede 
to  your  request.  Poor  or  deprived  of  his  kingdom,  he  who 
is  my  husband  is  my  spiritual  preceptor  and  I  shall  ever  follow 
him,  as  Suvarchala  follows  the  sun  or  the  blessed  Sachi  re- 
mains at  Indra's  side  or  Arundhati  near  Vasishtha  or  Rohini 
by  Shashin  or  Lopamudra  by  Agastya,  Sukanya  by  Syavana,

SUNDARA    KANDA 

Savitri  by  Satyavat,  Shrimati  by  Kapila,  Madayanti  by  Sandasa, 
Keshini  by  Sagara  and  Damayanti,  the  daughter  of  King 
Bhima  by  her  Lord  Naishada." 

These  words  of  Sita  infuriated  those  titan  women,  who  had 
been  sent  by  Ravana  and  they  overwhelmed  her  with  hard 
and  bitter  reproaches  while  Hanuman  crouched  silently  in 
the  Shingshapa  tree.  And  that  monkey  heard  those  demons 
threatening  Sita  in  this  wise. 

Surrounding  Sita  on  every  side,  licking  their  burning  lips 
again  and  again  and,  armed  with  spears,  they  menaced  her  in 
a  paroxysm  of  rage,  saying : 

"  Dost  thou  think  that  the  great  King  of  the  Titans,  Ravana, 
is  not  worthy  to  be  thy  lord  ?  " 

Threatened  by  those  terrible  looking  titan  women,  the  lovely 
Sita,  wiping  away  her  tears,  took  refuge  beneath  the  Shingshapa 
tree,  where,  surrounded  by  those  women,  that  large-eyed 
princess,  overcome  with  distress,  seated  herself.  And  all 
those  hideous  demons  overwhelmed  her  with  reproaches,  as, 
clad  in  a  mud-stained  sari,  reduced  to  the  last  extremity,  her 
countenance  wan,  she  remained  absorbed  in  her  grief. 

Thereupon,  a  grim-visaged  demon,  named  Vinata,  having 
hideous  teeth,  and  a  protruding  belly,  cried  out  angrily : — 

"  O  Sita,  thou  hast  demonstrated  thy  devotion  to  thy  lord 
sufficiently  but  all  excess  leads  to  suffering.  May  good  betide 
thee !  We  are  satisfied,  thou  hast  preserved  the  conventions 
common  among  men,  now  hear  what  I  say  to  thee  for  thy 
good  !  Do  thou  take  Ravana  for  thy  lord,  he,  the  chief  of  the 
titan  host  who,  like  unto  Vasava,  triumphs  over  his  enemies 
and  is  brave,  liberal  and  gracious  to  all  beings.  Forsaking 
that  wretched  wight,  Ramachandra,  take  Ravana  as  thy  hus- 
band !  Thy  person,  sprinkled  with  celestial  perfume  and  adorned 
with  excellent  ornaments,  do  thou,  O  Vaidehi,  like  unto  Swaha, 
the  consort  of  Agni  or  the  goddess  Sachi,  wife  of  Indra,  from 
to-day  become  the  Queen  of  the  Worlds !  What  shalt  thou 
do  with  Rama  who  is  wretched  and  has  but  a  short  time  to 
live  ?  If  thou  dost  not  follow  my  counsel,  that  very  instant 
we  shall  devour  thee." 

Thereafter,  another  titan,  named  Vikata,  with  pendulous 
breasts,  clenching  her  fists  angrily  addressed  Sita,  saying  :— 
393 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  O  Foolish  Daughter  of  Mitbila's  King,  out  of  compassion 
and  forbearance,  we  have  endured  thy  harsh  speech  and  yet 
thou  dost  not  follow  our  sage  and  expedient  counsel.  Thou 
hast  been  transported  to  the  further  shore  of  the  ocean  which 
is  inaccessible  to  others ;  Ravana  has  imprisoned  thee  in  his 
private  apartments  to  be  guarded  by  us,  O  Maithili,  not  even 
Indra  himself  can  liberate  thee.  Cease  from  weeping  and 
lamenting  and  yield  thyself  up  to  pleasure  and  delight,  O  Sita; 
disport  thyself  with  the  King  of  the  Titans.  O  Timid  Damsel, 
dost  thou  not  know  how  swiftly  the  youth  of  women  is  gone  ? 
Ere  it  fades,  pass  thy  days  happily.  Till  then  range  the 
enchanting  woods,  groves  and  hills  with  the  sovereign  of  the 
titans,  O  Thou  of  Sparkling  Eyes  !  Thousands  of  women  will 
attend  on  thee  if  thou  dost  take  the  lord  of  all  the  titans  as  thy 
consort,  but  if  thou  dost  not  follow  my  counsel,  I  will  tear 
thy  heart  out  and  feast  on  it,  O  Maithili." 

Then  another  titan  of  ferocious  looks,  named  Chandari, 
brandishing  a  great  spear,  said  :  "  Seeing  this  youthful  woman, 
with  the  eyes  of  a  young  doe  who  was  carried  away  by  Ravana 
and  brought  hither,  whose  breast  is  now  trembling  with  fear, 
I  feel  an  intense  desire  to  feast  on  her  liver,  spleen,  breast, 
heart,  limbs  and  head." 

At  this,  a  female  titan  called  Praghasa,  said  :  "  Of  what  use 
to  argue  about  her  ?  Let  us  stop  the  breath  in  the  throat  of 
this  heartless  woman  and  inform  Ravana  of  her  death.  He 
will  undoubtedly  say :   *  Do  ye  devour  her '." 

The  titan,  Ajamukhi  then  said :  "  Let  us  divide  her  equally ; 
disputation  is  unpleasing  to  me ;  let  our  favourite  drink  and 
different  garlands  be  brought  hither  speedily." 

At  that  moment  the  demon  Shurpanakha  said :  "  I  am  in 
full  accord  with  Ajamukhi's  words,  let  wine  that  dispels  all 
anxiety  be  brought  without  delay.  Gorged  with  human 
flesh,  we  will  dance  in  the  Nikumbhila  Grove." 

Hearing  the  monstrous  titan's  threats,  Sita,  who  resembled 
the  daughter  of  a  God,  her  endurance  at  an  end,  burst  into 
tears.

CHAPTER    25 

Sita  gives  way  to  Despair 

The  many  barbarous  threats  of  the  titan  women,  caused  the 
daughter  of  Janaka  to  give  way  to  tears  and  the  noble  Vaidehi, 
terror  stricken,  in  a  voice  broken  by  sobs,  answered  them, 
saying : — 

"  A  mortal  woman  may  not  be  the  wife  of  a  titan  ;  tear  me 
to  pieces  if  you  will  but  I  shall  never  follow  your  counsels." 

Surrounded  by  those  demons  and  threatened  by  Ravana, 
Sita,  who  resembled  the  daughter  of  a  God,  could  find  no 
refuge  anywhere  and,  seized  with  violent  trembling,  she  shrank 
away  from  them,  as  a  fawn  in  the  forest,  separated  from  the 
herd,  surrounded  by  wolves.  Clinging  to  the  flowering  branch 
of  an  Ashoka  tree,  sunk  in  grief,  Sita  bethought  herself  of  her 
lord.  Streams  of  tears  bathed  her  lovely  breast  and  over- 
come with  affliction,  she  could  see  no  end  to  her  distress. 
Like  a  plantain  tree  uprooted  by  the  storm,  she  lay,  the  fear 
that  the  titan  women  inspired  in  her  blanching  her  cheek ; 
her  long  thick  plait  moving  to  and  fro  as  she  shook,  resembling 
a  gliding  serpent. 

Groaning  in  her  grief  and  overcome  with  indignation, 
Maithili,  weeping,  began  to  lament,  exclaiming  sorrowfully: — 
"  O  Rama  !  "  and  again,  "  O  Lakshmana  ",  "  O  My  Mother 
Kaushalya ",  "  O  Sumitra ".  "  True  indeed  is  the  saying 
of  the  sages :  *  neither  man  nor  woman  can  die  ere  the  hour 
strikes ',  since  tormented  by  the  savage  titans  and  separated 
from  Rama,  I  am  still  able  to  survive  an  instant.  Alas  !  A 
woman  of  little  virtue  and  wretched,  I  am  about  to  die  far 
from  my  protector  as  a  laden  vessel  founders  in  the  midst  of 
the  waves  driven  by  the  blast  of  the  tempest.  In  the  absence 
of  my  lord,  I  am  sinking  under  the  load  of  my  affliction,  like 
a  river  bank  undermined  by  the  current.  Happy  are  those  who 
are  able  to  look  upon  my  lord,  whose  eyes  resemble  the  petals 
of  the  blossoming  trees,  whose  gait  is  like  a  lion's  and  who  is 
full  of  gratitude  and  gende  of  speech.  Deprived  of  the 
395 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

presence  of  Rama  of  subdued  soul,  it  is  as  hard  for  me  to 
breathe  as  for  him  who  has  swallowed  a  virulent  poison  and 
henceforth  my  life  is  forfeit.  What  heinous  fault  have  I 
committed  in  a  previous  existence  that  I  should  now  have  to 
surfer  such  cruel  misfortune  ?  So  intense  is  my  grief  that  I 
long  to  die,  but  alas,  I  am  surrounded  by  these  titan  women 
and  cannot  be  reunited  with  Rama.  Cursed  is  the  human 
state,  cursed  is  dependence  on  others,  since  one  may  not  yield 
up  one's  life  when  one  so  desires  it." 


CHAPTER     26 

Sita  prophesies  the  Titan's  Destruction 

Her  face  bathed  in  tears,  with  bowed  head  the  daughter  of 
Janaka  began  to  lament  once  more  and,  distracted  with  grief, 
beside  herself,  she  rolled  on  the  earth  like  a  colt  as  though 
she  had  lost  her  senses,  crying : — 

"  I,  the  spouse  of  Raghava,  who  allowed  himself  to  be 
deceived  by  the  titans  able  to  change  their  form  at  will,  was 
seized  by  the  ruthless  Ravana  who  bore  me  away.  Having 
been  made  captive  by  the  titans,  subject  to  their  insults  and 
menaces,  sunk  in  grief  and  anxiety,  I  am  no  longer  able  to 
endure  life.  Of  what  use  is  existence,  wealth  or  jewels  to  me, 
living  amidst  the  demons  far  from  Rama  of  the  great  Car  ? 
Assuredly  my  heart  must  be  of  iron,  ageless  and  imperishable, 
since  it  does  not  break  under  mine  affliction.  Woe  is  me, 
vile  and  wicked  creature  that  I  am,  since  I  still  breathe,  in 
the  absence  of  my  lord.  Even  my  left  foot  shall  not  touch  that 
Ranger  of  the  Night,  how  should  I  feel  any  love  for  Ravana, 
a  titan  ?  He,  who  in  his  perversity  seeks  to  seduce  me,  is  not 
conversant  with  my  nature,  nor  my  race,  nor  the  aversion  in 
which  he  is  held  by  me.  Torn  to  pieces,  rent  limb  from  limb 
or  cast  into  the  fire,  I  shall  never  submit  to  Ravana,  what  use 
is  there  in  further  discussion  ? 

*'  It  is  well  known  that  Raghava  is  righteous,  grateful  and 
compassionate;  that  he  has  become  pitiless  is  due  to  mine 
396 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

evil  karma.  Will  he  not  deliver  me,  he  who  in  Janasthana 
destroyed  fourteen  thousand  titans  singlehanded  ?  Even  were 
Lanka  in  the  midst  of  the  sea  and  inaccessible,  Raghava's 
arrows  would  transcend  all  obstacles.  What  can  prevent  the 
valiant  Rama  from  rejoining  his  beloved  wife,  who  has  been 
borne  away  by  a  titan  ?  I  fear  that  the  elder  brother  of 
Lakshmana  does  not  know  that  I  am  here,  for  if  he  did,  that 
warrior  would  not  endure  this  affront. 

"  The  King  of  the  Vultures,  who  would  have  informed 
Rama  of  mine  abduction,  was  slain  by  Ravana  in  the  struggle. 
Great  indeed  was  the  courage  manifested  by  Jatayu  in  coming 
to  mine  aid  and,  despite  his  age,  seeking  to  destroy  Ravana. 
Did  Raghava  know  that  I  was  here,  this  very  hour,  he  would 
rid  the  world  of  titans  with  his  flaming  shafts ;  he  would 
burn  up  Lanka,  swallow  the  ocean  and  blot  out  the  might  of 
Ravana.  From  each  dwelling  the  groans  and  cries  of  the 
female  titans,  their  husbands  slain,  would  have  risen,  as  mine 
do  now  or  even  louder,  and  Rama,  aided  by  Lakshmana 
would  range  the  city,  slaughtering  the  titans,  for  the  foe  in- 
stantly yields  up  his  life,  who  comes  face  to  face  with  them. 
Then  Lanka,  its  streets  tilled  with  smoke  issuing  from  the 
funeral  pyres,  encircled  by  wreaths  of  vultures,  would  soon 
resemble  a  charnel  house.  Soon  shall  I  be  avenged !  This 
matter  will  cost  you  all  dear,  for  such  inauspicious  omens  are 
to  be  seen  in  Lanka,  that  she  will  soon  be  shorn  of  her 
splendour. 

The  King  of  the  Titans,  the  vicious  Ravana  having  been 
slain,  Lanka,  now  prosperous  and  happy,  will  resemble  a 
widow.  Assuredly  I  shall  soon  hear  the  wailing  of  the  daughters 
of  the  titans  in  every  dwelling,  mourning  in  their  sorrow. 
Plunged  in  darkness,  deprived  of  her  glory,  her  valiant  titans 
slain,  the  city  of  Lanka  will  perish,  consumed  by  Rama's 
arrows,  when  that  hero,  the  corners  of  whose  eyes  are  red, 
learns  that  I  am  held  captive  in  the  titan's  abode.  The  time 
fixed  by  that  cruel  and  wicked  Ravana  is  at  hand  and  that 
vicious  wretch  has  resolved  to  destroy  me.  To  ignore  what 
is  prohibited,  is  the  practice  of  these  base  demons.  Terrible 
is  the  calamity  which  will  follow  this  outrage;  those  titans 
who  live  on  flesh  are  ignorant  of  virtue.  Assuredly  that  titan 
397 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

intends  me  for  his  morning  repast ;  I  am  helpless,  what  can 
I  do  in  the  absence  of  my  beloved  ?  Deprived  of  my  lord's 
presence,  stricken  with  grief,  not  beholding  Rama,  the  corners 
of  whose  eyes  are  red,  may  I  soon  see  the  God  Vaivasvata ! 
Nay,  the  elder  brother  of  Bharata  is  unaware  that  I  still  live, 
else  he  and  Lakshmana  would  have  scoured  the  earth  for  me. 
Without  doubt,  overwhelmed  by  my  foes,  that  warrior,  the 
elder  brother  of  Lakshmana  has  renounced  his  body  and 
repaired  to  the  Celestial  Region. 

Happy  are  the  Gods,  Gandharvas,  Siddhas  and  the  great 
Rishis  who  are  able  to  look  on  the  heroic  Rama.  It  may  be 
that  the  sagacious  and  royal  Sage  Rama,  has  been  absorbed  in 
the  Absolute  and  hath  no  longer  any  need  of  a  consort  or  that 
one  who  is  present  inspires  joy,  but  the  absent  are  forgotten. 
Perchance  the  fault  is  mine,  and  I  have  lost  the  right  to  happi- 
ness, I,  the  lovely  Sita,  separated  from  the  illustrious  Rama. 
Death  to  me  is  preferable  to  life,  bereft  of  that  magnanimous 
One,  that  great  hero  of  imperishable  exploits,  the  destroyer 
of  his  foes  !  It  may  be  that  the  two  brothers,  those  chiefs  of 
men  have  laid  down  their  arms,  they  who  feed  on  the  roots 
and  woodland  fruits,  passing  their  lives  in  the  forest  or  they 
have  been  put  to  death  through  treachery  by  the  vile  Ravana, 
the  last  of  the  titans.  If  that  be  so,  then  with  all  my  heart 
I  long  for  death  nor  is  it  forbidden  me  in  my  distress.  Blessed 
are  those  high-souled  ascetics  who  are  illumined,  their  senses 
subdued,  for  whom  there  is  neither  desire  nor  aversion ;  for 
them,  neither  love  nor  hate  gives  rise  to  joy  or  pain ;  they  are 
free ;  salutations  to  those  great  beings !  Forsaken  by  the 
beloved  Rama,  versed  in  the  science  of  the  soul  and  having 
fallen  into  the  power  of  the  wicked  Ravana,  I  shall  yield  up 
my  life." 


CHAPTER     27 

Trijata's  Dream 

These  words  of  Sita  roused  the  female  titans  to  great  fury 
and  some  hurried  away  to  repeat  them  to  that  vile  creature, 
Ravana. 

398 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Then  those  monsters  of  hideous  aspect  approached  her  and 
began  to  threaten  her  in  the  same  way  as  before  with  as  little 
success  and  some  said : 

"  O  Wretched  Sita,  to-day  those  demons  whose  destruction 
thou  hast  planned,  will  devour  thy  flesh  at  their  pleasure." 

Seeing  Sita  threatened  by  those  vile  demons,  Trijata,  who  was 
aged  and  prudent,  said  to  them :  "  Ye  Wretches,  devour  me, 
but  do  not  lay  hands  on  Sita,  the  daughter  of  Janaka  and  the 
beloved  daughter-in-law  of  King  Dasaratha.  Last  night,  I 
had  a  terrible  dream  causing  my  hair  to  stand  on  end,  fore- 
telling the  overthrow  of  the  titans  and  the  triumph  of  this 
woman's  husband." 

Hearing  these  words  uttered  by  Trijata,  all  those  titan  women, 
filled  with  ire,  terrified,  demanded  that  she  should  speak 
further,  saying : — "  Do  thou  relate  the  manner  of  thy  dream 
and  what  thou  didst  behold  last  night." 

Hearing  those  words,  falling  from  the  lips  of  the  titan  women, 
Trijata  began  to  relate  the  dream  that  had  come  to  her  in  the 
early  hours,  saying: — 

"  I  beheld  a  celestial  chariot  made  of  ivory,  drawn  by  a 
hundred  swans  traversing  the  ethereal  regions  in  which 
Raghava  accompanied  by  Lakshmana  stood  clad  in  dazzling 
raiment,  adorned  with  garlands.  And  I  saw  Sita  wearing  the 
purest  white,  standing  on  a  snow-white  mountain  surrounded 
by  the  sea  and  she  was  re-united  with  Rama,  as  the  light  with 
the  sun.  And  again  I  beheld  Raghava  seated  on  a  mighty 
elephant  possessing  four  tusks,  resembling  a  hill,  as  also  Laksh- 
mana, whereupon  those  two  lions  among  heroes,  ablaze  with 
their  own  effulgence,  approached  Janaki  arrayed  in  dazzling 
robes  and  decked  with  garlands.  Upon  this,  she  mounted 
on  the  shoulders  of  an  elephant  led  by  her  lord,  appearing 
in  the  sky  near  the  summit  of  that  mountain !  Thereafter, 
that  lotus-eyed  one,  rose  into  the  air  from  her  husband's 
embrace  and  I  beheld  her  wiping  the  sun  and  moon  with 
her  hand.  Then  that  foremost  among  elephants  with  those 
two  princes  and  the  large-eyed  Sita  stood  over  Lanka. 

"  And  again,  in  dream,  I  saw  Rama,  clothed  in  brilliant  attire, 

wearing  garlands,  accompanied  by  Lakshmana,  in  a  chariot 

drawn  by  eight  white  bullocks  and  I  beheld  that  foremost  of 

399 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

men,  Rama,  whose  essence  is  valour  with  his  brother  Laksh- 
mana  and  Sita  ascending  a  celestial  flowery  car,  bright  as  the 
sun,  driving  towards  the  northern  regions. 

"  Then  I  saw  Ravana,  lying  on  the  earth  covered  in  oil,  shaven, 
attired  in  red,  garlanded  with  oleander  flowers,  intoxicated  and 
still  drinking.  And  I  beheld  him  falling  from  the  flowery 
chariot,  Pushpaka,  on  to  the  earth,  shorn,  wearing  a  black  cloth, 
dragged  hither  and  thither  by  a  woman.  Thereafter  I  saw 
him  seated  in  a  chariot  drawn  by  asses,  robed  in  red,  with  his 
body  stained  likewise,  quaffing  sesamum  oil,  laughing  and 
dancing,  his  mind  confused,  his  senses  clouded,  speeding 
toward  the  south.  Again  I  saw  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the 
Titans,  stricken  with  fear,  fall  headlong  on  the  earth,  thereafter 
leaping  up  suddenly,  terrified,  bemused  with  liquor,  staggering 
about  naked  like  a  madman,  incapable  of  speech  yet  babbling 
continuously,  stinking  and  foul,  resembling  hell  itself.  Then, 
proceeding  towards  the  south,  he  entered  a  lake  where  even 
the  mud  had  dried  up  and  a  dark  woman  clad  in  red,  be- 
smeared with  mud,  placed  a  rope  round  the  neck  of  Dasha- 
griva  dragging  him  to  the  region  of  death. 

"  There  I  beheld  the  mighty  Kumbhakarna  and  all  the  sons 
of  Ravana,  their  heads  shaven,  besmeared  with  oil.  Dasha- 
griva  riding  a  boar,  Indrajita  a  porpoise  and  Kumbhakarna  a 
camel ;  only  Bibishana  appeared  to  me  standing  in  space, 
under  a  white  canopy,  accompanied  by  four  ministers.  There- 
after a  great  company  of  titans  wearing  red  garlands  and 
raiment  filed  past,  playing  on  stringed  instruments,  dancing 
and  drinking.  And  I  beheld  the  enchanting  city  of  Lanka, 
filled  with  elephants,  chariots  and  horses,  her  gateways  and 
arches  shattered,  falling  into  the  sea.  And  in  Lanka,  crimson 
with  flames,  the  female  titans  were  laughing  and  creating  a 
terrible  clamour,  quaffing  oil.  I  saw  Kumbhakarna  and  all 
the  other  titans,  dark-hued,  wearing  scarlet  robes,  falling 
headlong  into  a  cesspool. 

"  Do  ye  now  depart  since  Raghava  is  about  to  be  re-united 
with  Sita  and,  in  extreme  ire,  will  exterminate  you  all  with  the 
titans.  If  his  beloved  and  revered  consort,  who,  for  his  sake, 
followed  him  to  the  forest,  is  threatened  and  tormented  by  you, 
Raghava  will  never  brook  the  insult.  Enough  therefore  of 
400 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

these  invidious  threats,  occupy  yourselves  in  consoling  her 
and  crave  her  forgiveness ;  you  should  seek  to  influence  Vaidehi 
by  persuasion.  That  unfortunate  one,  on  whose  account  I 
had  so  significant  a  dream,  is  about  to  be  delivered  from 
her  woes  and  re-united  to  her  beloved  and  illustrious  lord  once 
more.  Even  after  the  menaces  you  have  uttered,  let  us  give  up 
all  harsh  words  and  implore  her  forgiveness.  In  truth,  a 
terrible  disaster  for  the  titans  will  proceed  from  Raghava. 
By  casting  yourselves  at  her  feet,  you  may  placate  Maithili, 
the  daughter  of  Janaka,  who  is  able  to  preserve  us  from  a 
great  calamity.  Furthermore,  I  do  not  find  any  blemish  in 
that  lady  of  large  eyes  nor  the  least  defect  in  any  of  her  limbs. 
Verily  I  deem  the  misfortune  that  has  befallen  this  goddess, 
who  does  not  merit  adversity,  has  no  more  substance  than  a 
shadow. 

"  I  foresee  the  immediate  attainment  of  Vaidehi's  desires, 
the  destruction  of  the  King  of  the  Titans  and  the  imminent 
triumph  of  Raghava.  Behold  the  indications  of  great  joy, 
held  in  check  by  that  lady,  in  the  twitching  of  her  left  eye 
large  as  a  lotus  petal  and  without  apparent  cause  ;  the  slight 
trembling  of  the  left  arm  of  that  virtuous  daughter  of  Videha, 
her  left  thigh  too  resembling  an  elephant's  trunk  is  quivering, 
as  if  Raghava  himself  stood  before  her  and  the  winged  crea- 
tures nesting  in  the  branches  above  her  are  pouring  forth 
their  song  as  if  to  announce  the  advent  of  an  auspicious  hour." 

Thereupon,  that  modest  and  youthful  woman,  greatly 
delighted  at  the  prospect  of  her  husband's  victory,  said  to 
them  :  "  If  this  prove  true  I  will  be  your  protector." 


CHAPTER    28 

Site's  Lament 

Hearing  the  harsh  speech  of  that  King  of  the  Titans,  Ravana, 
the  unfortunate   Sita   began   to  tremble,   as   a  she-elephant 
attacked  by  a  lion  on  the  edge  of  the  forest, 
401 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Threatened  by  Ravana  and  encircled  by  the  titans,  that 
timid  damsel  gave  way  to  despair  like  a  young  girl  abandoned 
in  a  wood. 

She  reflected :  "  The  sages  affirm  truly  that  death  does  not 
come  before  the  appointed  hour  since,  worthless  creature  that 
I  am,  I  still  live  after  these  insults.  Bereft  of  happiness, 
rilled  with  misery,  my  heart  must  be  hard  indeed  that  it  does 
not  break  into  a  hundred  pieces  this  day,  like  the  crest  of  a 
mountain  struck  by  lightning.  Nay,  I  am  not  to  blame  for  this 
— I  may  be  slain  by  that  dreadful  monster  but  I  can  no  more 
give  him  my  affection  than  a  brahmin  can  impart  the  teachings 
of  the  Veda  to  one  of  low  caste.  If  that  Lord  of  the  Worlds 
does  not  appear  at  the  appointed  hour,  that  vile  King  of  the 
Titans  will  cut  me  to  pieces  with  his  sharp  weapons  as  a  sur- 
geon cuts  the  foetus  from  the  heart  of  its  mother.  Two 
months  will  quickly  pass  away  and  I  shall  have  to  suffer  the 
pain  of  death,  unhappy  creature  that  I  am,  like  a  thief,  who 
having  disobeyed  his  sovereign  is  bound  and  being  led  to 
execution  when  the  night  is  over. 

"  O  Rama,  O  Lakshmana,  O  Sumitra  !  O  Mother  of  Rama  ! 
O  My  Mothers  !  I  am  about  to  perish  miserably  as  a  ship 
foundering  in  the  sea  battered  by  the  storm.  Assuredly  those 
two  valiant  princes  must  have  fallen  under  the  blows  of  that 
creature  disguised  as  a  deer,  like  a  bull  or  lion  struck  by  light- 
ning. There  is  no  doubt  that  it  was  fate  in  the  form  of  a 
deer  that  deluded  me,  unfortunate  creature  that  I  am  and  in 
my  folly  I  sent  those  two  princes,  Rama  and  Lakshmana  to 
capture  it.  Alas !  O  Rama,  O  Thou  of  truthful  vows  and 
long  arms !  O  Thou,  whose  countenance  shines  like  the  full 
moon !  O  My  Life,  thou,  the  benefactor  and  friend  of  all 
beings,  art  not  aware  that  I  am  about  to  be  put  to  death  by 
the  titans.  For  me,  who  have  no  other  God  than  my  lord, 
my  patience,  my  sleeping  on  the  bare  ground,  my  observance 
of  duty,  my  devotion  to  my  husband  have  all  been  in  vain, 
as  a  service  rendered  to  one  who  is  ungrateful.  Vain  has  it 
been,  that  I  have  fulfilled  my  duty  and  that  I  am  wholly 
devoted  to  thee  alone  since  I  do  not  behold  thee  and  in  thine 
absence,  wasting  away,  pale  and  weak,  have  given  up  all  hope 
of  being  re-united  with  thee.  Having  courageously  carried  out 
402 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

the  behests  of  thy  sire,  having  fulfilled  thy  vow,  returning 
from  the  forest,  thou  shalt  sport  with  many  large-eyed  ladies 
in  peace.  O  Rama,  I,  who  conceived  a  lasting  love  for  thee, 
to  mine  own  destruction  was  wholly  attached  to  thee ;  having 
practised  asceticism  and  observed  my  vows,  I  am  about  to  lose 
my  life,  woe  unto  me,  unfortunate  wretch  that  I  am !  Gladly 
would  I  take  my  life  by  means  of  poison  or  by  sharp  weapons 
but  there  is  none  who  will  bring  them  to  me  in  this  city  of 
the  titans." 

Overcome  by  sorrow,  reflecting  for  a  long  time,  Sita  undid 
the  cord  that  tied  her  hair,  saying  : — "  I  shall  hang  myself  with 
this  cord  and  reach  the  abode  of  death." 

Then  the  lovely  Sita,  whose  form  was  full  of  grace,  took  hold 
of  a  branch  of  the  tree  under  which  she  stood  and  became 
absorbed  in  the  thought  of  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  her  kinsfolk; 
and  many  auspicious  signs  removing  her  grief  and  lending 
her  courage,  well-known  in  the  world,  appeared  to  her,  in- 
dicating the  advent  of  future  well-being. 


chapter   29 

Sita  observes  auspicious  Portents 

Whilst  the  irreproachable  and  lovely  princess  remained 
bereft  of  joy  and  full  of  anxiety,  she  beheld  auspicious  portents 
on  every  side,  resembling  willing  servants  attendant  on  a 
wealthy  man.  And  the  large  left  eye  of  that  lady  of  lovely 
looks,  with  its  dark  pupil,  began  to  twitch  like  a  lotus  set  spinning 
by  a  fish.  And  her  beautiful  plump  and  rounded  arm,  sprinkled 
with  sandal  and  aloes  which  ere  this,  had  served  her  lord 
as  a  pillow,  began  to  tremble  again  and  again.  Her  left  thigh, 
like  unto  the  tapering  trunk  of  an  elephant,  moved  convul- 
sively foretelling  that  she  would  soon  behold  Rama  and  the 
golden  sari,  now  covered  with  dust,  of  the  large-eyed  Maithili, 
whose  teeth  were  like  the  seeds  of  a  pomegranate,  slipped  from 
her  beautiful  shoulders.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Comforted  by  these  signs  and  others  also,  that  foretold  a 
happy  ending,  Sita  of  lovely  lashes  resembling  a  plant  dried 
by  the  wind  and  sun,  reviving  under  tardy  rain,  experienced 
a  great  felicity.  Then  her  countenance,  her  lips  like  Bimba 
fruit,  her  beautiful  eyes,  the  curve  of  her  lashes  and  her  sharp 
teeth,  recovered  their  beauty  once  more  as  the  moon  issuing 
from  the  mouth  of  Rahu. 

Her  despair  and  exhaustion  removed,  her  fever  allayed,  her 
grief  was  assuaged  and  her  heart  filled  with  joy  and  that  noble 
lady  looked  as  beautiful  as  the  moon  of  cool  rays  in  its  waxing 
period. 


CHAPTER     30      • 

Hanumari's  Reflections 

The  valiant  Hanuman  who  had  heard  all  that  Sita,  Trijata 
and  the  titans  had  said,  gazed  on  that  illustrious  damsel  who 
resembled  a  celestial  being  from  the  Nandana  Gardens  and 
many  thoughts  flitted  through  the  mind  of  that  monkey. 

He  reflected :  "  She,  who  was  sought  in  every  place  by 
thousands  and  millions  of  monkeys,  is  here  and  it  is  I  who 
have  found  her.  Engaged  as  a  skilful  spy  to  discover  the 
strength  of  the  enemy  I  have  stolen  into  the  city  and  know 
everything  concerning  the  might  of  Ravana  and  the  resources 
of  the  titans  as  also  of  their  capital.  It  is  for  me  to  console  the 
consort  of  that  immeasurably  illustrious  prince,  who  is  com- 
passionate to  all  beings,  for  she  is  pining  for  her  lord.  I  shall 
seek  to  gain  the  confidence  of  this  lady,  whose  countenance 
resembles  the  full  moon,  who  formerly  was  unacquainted  with 
suffering  and  who  cannot  see  any  end  to  her  woes.  If  I  return, 
without  having  comforted  that  virtuous  lady  whose  soul  is 
overwhelmed  with  grief,  my  journey  will  have  been  in  vain. 
In  sooth,  when  I  have  departed,  that  illustrious  Princess  Janaki, 
giving  up  all  hope  of  deliverance,  will  yield  up  her  life  and  that 
long-armed  warrior,  whose  countenance  resembles  the  full 
moon,  anxious  to  behold  Sita  is  equally  worthy  of  consolation. 
404 


SUNDARA     KANDA 

To  speak  to  her  in  the  presence  of  these  titans  is  impossible, 
what  then  shall  I  do  ?  I  am  in  a  great  dilemna.  If  I  do  not 
give  her  some  reassurance  in  the  last  hour  of  the  night,  she 
will  undoubtedly  give  up  her  life  and  if  Rama  enquires  of  me, 
*  What  did  Sita  of  slender  waist  say  ? '  what  answer  can  I  give 
to  him  if  I  have  had  no  converse  with  her  ?  If  I  return  without 
having  achieved  my  purpose  regarding  Sita,  Kakutstha  will 
consume  me  with  his  fiery  glance,  then  it  were  vain  to  urge 
my  master  to  take  action  for  Rama's  sake,  by  placing  himself 
at  the  head  of  his  forces. 

"  I  shall  take  the  first  opportunity  offered  by  these  titan 
women  to  reassure  that  sorely  tried  lady,  yet  in  this  insigni- 
ficant form  and  monkey  shape,  if  I  assume  a  human  voice  and 
speak  in  sanskrita  like  a  sage,  Sita  will  deem  me  to  be  Ravana 
and  she  will  be  terrified  !  It  is  essential  however  that  I  express 
myself  in  the  human  tongue,  how  otherwise  can  I  inspire  this 
irreproachable  lady  with  courage  ?  Seeing  my  shape  and  hear- 
ing me  speak,  Janaki,  who  has  been  terrorised  by  the  titans, 
will  be  seized  with  an  even  greater  fear  and  that  illustrious 
and  large-eyed  Sita  will  cry  out,  imagining  me  to  be  Ravana, 
who  is  able  to  change  his  form  at  will. 

"  Hearing  her  cry,  the  whole  company  of  titans,  armed  with 
every  kind  of  weapon,  will  form  themselves  into  a  great  mass 
resembling  death  itself  and,  hideous  and  indomitable,  will 
rush  on  me  from  every  side  and  seek  to  destroy  me  or  take  me 
captive.  Then,  beholding  me  leap  from  branch  to  branch 
and  climb  to  the  tops  of  the  highest  trees,  they  will  become 
exceedingly  alarmed  and  will  fill  the  woods  with  their  wild 
cries ;  thereafter  they  will  call  the  titans  who  are  engaged  in 
guarding  the  king's  palace  to  their  aid  and,  on  account  of  their 
native  excitability,  will  seize  hold  of  every  kind  of  weapon, 
spears,  darts,  and  swords  and  hasten  to  join  in  the  fray. 
Surrounded  by  them  on  all  sides,  if  I  slay  that  host  of  titans, 
exhausted,  I  shall  be  unable  to  cross  the  ocean  or  they,  out- 
numbering me,  will  succeed  in  capturing  me  and,  being  a 
prisoner,  that  lady  will  reap  no  benefit  from  my  attempt. 

"  Alternatively,  in  their  passion  for  evil  doing,  they  may 
even  slay  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  which  will  completely  defeat 
the  great  design  of  Rama  and  Sugriva  E  Janaki  dwells  in  an 
405 


THE   RAMAYAXA    OF    VALMIKI 

inaccessible  and  secret  place  surrounded  by  the  sea,  guarded 
on  all  sides  by  the  titans  with  all  its  approaches  closed.  If  I 
am  slain  or  captured  by  the  titans  in  combat,  I  know  of  no 
other  monkey  who  can  cross  the  four  hundred  miles  of  sea. 
Even  if  I  destroy  thousands  of  titans,  I  should  not  then  be 
able  to  reach  the  other  shore  of  the  vast  ocean.  Battles  are 
hazardous  and  I  do  not  like  to  engage  in  so  uncertain  an  enter- 
prise ;  what  wise  person  would  take  any  risk  in  a  matter  of 
trust  ?  It  would  be  a  great  error  to  frighten  Vaidehi  by  address- 
ing her,  yet  if  I  do  not  do  so,  she  will  surely  perish.  Under- 
takings often  fail  through  an  incompetent  messenger  unable  to 
take  advantage  of  time  and  place,  as  darkness  is  overcome  by 
the  rising  sun ;  in  such  cases,  whether  it  concerns  the  accom- 
plishment or  avoidance  of  any  matter,  the  most  widely  planned 
projects  do  not  succeed.  Assuredly  a  presumptuous  messenger 
ruins  all !  How  shall  I  act  therefore,  so  that  my  mission  does  not 
prove  vain  ?  How  shall  I  show  myself  equal  to  this  charge  ? 
How  shall  the  crossing  of  the  ocean  not  prove  to  have  been  use- 
less ?  How  can  I  persuade  Sita  to  listen  to  me  without  inspiring 
fear  in  her  ?  " 

Having  put  all  these  questions  to  himself,  Hanuman  formed 
the  following  resolution : 

"  I  shall  speak  to  her  of  Rama  of  immortal  exploits,  for  then 
his  dear  consort  will  not  be  afraid  of  me  since  she  is  wholly 
absorbed  in  the  thought  of  her  lord.  In  a  gentle  voice,  utter- 
ing the  name  of  Rama,  the  foremost  of  the  Ikshwakus  of  subdued 
soul  and,  lauding  his  piety  and  renown  in  sweet  accents,  I 
shall  induce  Sita  to  listen  to  me.  There  is  nothing  I  will  not 
do  to  inspire  her  with  confidence." 

Thereupon,  the  mighty  Hanuman,  looking  down  on  the 
consort  of  the  Lord  of  the  World  from  the  branches  of  the 
tree  where  he  sat  concealed,  spoke  to  her  in  melodious  and 
candid  tones. 

CHAPTER    31 
Hanuman  praises  Rama 

Having  examined  the  matter  from  every  aspect,  that  intelligent 

monkey  began  to  pour  sweet  words  into  Vaidehi's  ear,  saying  : — 

406 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

"There  was  a  king  named  Dasaratha,  the  possessor  of 
chariots,  horses  and  elephants,  one  by  nature  devout  and 
illustrious,  the  glory  of  the  Ikshwakus.  To  harm  none  was 
his  delight  and  he  was  high-minded  and  compassionate,  a 
true  hero  of  his  race  that  found  its  splendour  and  the  growth 
of  its  prosperity  in  him.  Clad  in  all  the  insignia  of  royalty 
and  majesty,  that  lion  among  kings,  renowned  in  the  four 
regions,  shed  the  felicity  he  enjoyed  over  all.  His  beloved 
eldest  son,  whose  countenance  was  as  bright  as  the  moon, 
was  called  Rama,  possessor  of  a  keen  intellect  and  the  most 
skilled  of  archers.  Faithful  to  his  vows,  the  defender  of  his 
people,  the  protector  of  all  beings,  upholder  of  justice,  he  was 
the  scourge  of  his  foes. 

"  At  the  command  of  his  aged  sire,  his  word  his  bond,  that 
hero  accompanied  by  his  consort  and  his  brother  was  banished 
to  the  forest.  Whilst  giving  himself  up  to  the  chase  in  that 
vast  solitude,  he  slew  large  numbers  of  valiant  titans  who 
were  able  to  change  their  form  at  will. 

When  Ravana  learnt  that  he  had  destroyed  Janasthana  and 
killed  Khara  and  Dushana,  he  in  fury,  bore  Janaki  away,  having 
lured  her  lord  far  into  the  forest  by  the  aid  of  Maricha  in  the 
form  of  a  deer. 

"  Whilst  searching  everywhere  to  discover  the  divine  and 
irreproachable  Sita,  Rama  found  a  friend  in  the  forest,  the 
Monkey  Sugriva,  Bringing  about  the  destruction  of  Bali, 
Rama,  the  conqueror  of  hostile  cities,  conferred  the  monkey 
kingdom  on  the  magnanimous  Sugriva  and  by  his  decree, 
thousands  of  monkeys,  able  to  change  their  form  at  will,  set 
out  to  search  for  that  goddess  in  every  region.  I  am  one  of 
those  who,  at  the  instance  of  Sampati,  crossed  the  sea  four 
hundred  miles  in  width,  on  account  of  that  large-eyed  beauty. 
Hearing  of  her  comeliness,  her  grace  and  distinguishing 
characteristics  from  Rama,  I  have  been  enabled  to  findherat  last." 

Having  spoken  thus,  that  bull  among  monkeys  fell  silent. 

And  Janaki  was  extremely  astonished,  hearing  that  speech 
and  brushing  aside  her  lovely  tangled  locks  which  concealed 
her  face,  she  looked  up  into  the  Shingshapa  tree. 

Hearing  the  words  of  that  monkey,  Sita  glanced  enquiringly 

to  the  four  quarters  and  other  regions,  whilst  an  extreme  delight 

407 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

flooded  her  whole  being  as  she  remembered  Rama.  Then, 
glancing  from  side  to  side  and  up  and  down,  she  espied  the 
son  of  Vata,  who  resembled  the  rising  sun,  that  minister  of  the 
King  of  the  Monkeys  of  incomparable  wisdom. 


CHAPTER    32 

Sita  sees  Hanuman 

Beholding  that  monkey  of  pleasing  speech,  clad  in  white 
raiment,  resembling  a  flash  of  lightning,  crouching  concealed 
among  the  branches,  bright  as  a  cluster  of  Ashoka  flowers 
and  like  gold  refined  in  the  crucible,  Sita  was  greatly  agitated. 
Observing  that  foremost  of  monkeys  of  humble  mien, 
Maithili  said  to  herself  in  extreme  surprise:  "Ah!  What  a 
terrible  looking  monkey,  unacceptable  and  hideous  to  behold." 
Thinking  thus,  her  fears  increased  and  she  broke  into  counriess 
plaintive  lamentations.  Then  the  lovely  Sita  cried  out  in  her 
terror :  "  O  Rama,  O  Rama,  O  Lakshmana !  "  and  the  voice 
of  that  virtuous  princess  grew  fainter  and  fainter  till,  casting 
her  eyes  on  that  excellent  monkey  once  more,  who  had  assumed 
a  reverent  attitude,  Maithili  said  to  herself :  "  It  must  be  a 
dream." 

Observing  the  face  of  that  Indra  among  Monkeys  with  its 
deep  scars  as  has  been  described  and,  looking  on  that  excellent 
ape,  the  most  honourable  son  of  the  Wind,  the  first  of  the 
wise,  Sita  lost  consciousness  and  became  like  one  dead.  There- 
after, slowly  regaining  her  senses,  she  said  to  herself :  "  This 
vision  of  a  monkey  is  condemned  by  the  scriptures  and  is  an 
inauspicious  dream!  Can  all  be  well  with  Rama,  who  is  accom- 
panied by  Lakshmana  and  my  father  King  Janaka  ?  Yet  it 
can  be  no  dream  for,  in  the  grief  and  misfortune  that  over- 
whelms me,  I  am  no  longer  able  to  sleep  and,  far  from  him 
whose  countenance  resembles  the  full  moon,  no  joy  remains 
for  me.  Through  constantly  thinking  and  calling  on  Rama, 
I  imagine  I  hear  and  see  only  those  things  which  are  related 
to  Rama.  For  my  love  is  a  torment,  my  whole  being  flows 
408 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

towards  him,  ever  absorbed  in  his  rememberance  I  see  and 
hear  him  alone.  Is  it  an  illusion  ?  This  is  what  perturbs  me 
and  makes  me  uneasy.  I  deem  this  to  be  but  a  phantom  of 
the  mind  yet  thinking  thus,  I  still  behold  it,  while  an  imaginary 
object  can  never  have  a  form  and  he  who  is  thus  addressing 
me  has  a  distinct  form.  Salutations  to  Vachaspati  who  is 
accompanied  by  the  God  who  bears  the  Thunderbolt !  Saluta- 
tions to  Swyambhu  and  the  God  who  partakes  of  offerings! 
May  they  grant  that  the  creature  who  has  spoken  in  my  presence, 
be  real  and  not  illusory !  "

Hanuman's  Converse  with  the  Princess  Sita 

Slipping  down  from  the.  tree,  Hanuman,  whose  face  was  the 
colour  of  coral,  attired  in  a  humble  guise,  approached  Sita 
and  that  mighty  son  of  the  Wind  with  joined  palms  addressed 
her  in  gentle  tones,  saying : 

"  Who  art  thou,  O  Lady,  whose  eyes  resemble  lotus 
petals,  who,  wearing  a  soiled  silken  garment  art  supporting 
thyself  by  the  branch  of  the  tree  ?  O  Irreproachable  One, 
why  are  tears  of  suffering  falling  from  thine  eyes,  that  resemble 
the  lotus,  as  water  flows  from  a  broken  vessel  ?  O  Fair  One, 
who  art  thou  among  the  Celestials,  Titans,  Nagas,  Gandharvas, 
Rakshas,  Yakshas  and  Kinneras  ?  Or  do  the  Rudras  claim  that 
thou  art  born  of  them  or  the  Wind-gods  or  the  Vasus,  O  Lady 
of  exquisite  features  ?  To  me  thou  appearest  to  be  of  divine 
origin.  Art  thou  Rohini,  foremost  and  most  brilliant  of  stars, 
who,  separated  from  the  moon  has  fallen  from  the  abode  of 
the  immortals  ?  Or  art  thou  the  lovely  dark-eyed  Arundhati, 
who  hath  fled  in  wrath  or  in  pride  from  her  lord,  Snri  Vasishtha? 
Is  it  for  a  son,  a  father,  a  brother  or  a  husband,  whose  departure 
from  this  world  thou  art  mourning,  O  Lady  of  slender  waist  ? 
By  thy  tears  and  sighs  and  thy  lying  on  the  earth,  it  seems 
to  me  that  thou  art  not  a  celestial  being  and  further  thou  dost 
ever  and  again  call  on  the  name  of  a  king.  From  the  marks  on 
409 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

thy  person  I  deem  thee  to  be  the  consort  or  the  daughter  of  a 
monarch.  Art  thou  not  Sita,  who  was  ruthlessly  borne  away 
by  Ravana  from  Janasthana  ?  May  prosperity  attend  thee ! 
From  thy  wretched  plight,  thine  unrivalled  beauty  and  thine 
ascetic  garb,  I  deem  thee  to  be  Rama's  consort." 

Hearing  Hanuman's  words  and  filled  with  joy  at  the  sound 
of  Rama's  name,  Vaidehi  answered  him,  as  he  stood  beneath  the 
tree,  saying : 

"  I  am  the  daughter-in-law  of  Dasaratha,  foremost  among 
the  kings  of  the  world,  a  knower  of  the  Self,  the  destroyer  of 
hostile  armies.  I  am  the  daughter  of  King  Janaka,  the 
magnanimous  sovereign  of  Videha  and  my  name  is  Sita,  the 
consort  of  the  highly  intelligent  Rama,  who  is  endowed  with 
wisdom.  For  twelve  years  I  dwelt  in  Raghava's  abode, 
experiencing  every  earthly  delight  and  satisfying  every  desire. 
In  the  thirteenth  year,  the  king,  with  the  approval  of  his  ministers, 
resolved  to  install  Rama,  the  joy  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku 
on  the  throne.  As  they  were  preparing  to  anoint  Rama  as 
heir-apparent,  Queen  Kaikeyi  addressed  her  lord,  saying : — 

"  '  I  will  neither  eat  nor  drink  of  that  which  is  served  to  me 
each  day  but  shall  put  an  end  to  my  existence  if  Rama  be 
installed.  Let  the  boons  that,  in  gratitude,  thou  didst  grant 
me,  be  redeemed  and  let  Raghava  repair  to  the  forest '. 

"  The  king,  faithful  to  his  bond,  recollected  the  boons 
made  to  the  queen  and  hearing  those  cruel  and  unpleasing 
words  was  lost  in  grief.  Then  that  aged  monarch,  adhering 
firmly  to  his  vow,  weeping,  besought  his  eldest  son  to  renounce 
the  throne.  That  illustrious  prince  to  whom  the  words  of  his 
sire  were  more  to  be  prized  than  the  throne,  inwardly  assenting, 
promised  to  obey.  Rama,  ever  a  giver,  seeking  no  return, 
truthful,  never  uttering  a  falsehood  even  were  his  life  to  be 
made  forfeit,  is  essentially  brave.  Laying  aside  his  costly 
attire,  the  highly  glorious  Rama  with  his  whole  heart,  re- 
nounced the  kingdom  and  gave  me  into  his  mother's  keeping, 
but  I,  assuming  the  garb  of  an  ascetic,  quickly  prepared  to 
accompany  him  to  the  forest,  for,  separated  from  him,  I  could 
not  bear  to  dwell  even  in  the  celestial  regions.  Then  the 
fortunate  Saumitri,  the  enhancer  of  his  friends'  delight,  donning 
robes  of  bark  and  kusha  grass  also  prepared  to  follow  his 
410 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

elder  brother.  In  deference  to  the  will  of  our  sovereign,  firm 
in  our  vows,  we  entered  the  dark  and  unknown  forest.  While 
that  one  of  immeasurable  effulgence  was  dwelling  in  the 
Dandaka  Forest,  I,  his  consort,  was  carried  away  by  the  Titan, 
Ravana  of  perverse  soul.  Two  months  is  the  time  fixed  by 
him,  after  which  I  am  to  die." 


CHAPTER    34 

Sita's  Uncertainty  on  seeing  Hanuman 

Hearing  the  words  of  Sita,  who  was  stricken  with  grief, 
Hanuman,  the  foremost  among  monkeys,  in  order  to  reassure 
her,  said : — 

"  O  Divine  Vaidehi,  by  Rama's  decree  I  have  come  as  a 
messenger  to  thee ;  he  is  safe  and  enquires  as  to  thy  welfare. 
Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  who  is  versed  in  the  Veda,  con- 
versant with  the  use  of  the  Brahmastra,  the  foremost  of  the 
learned,  offers  salutations  to  thee,  O  Queen !  The  highly 
resplendent  Lakshmana  too,  the  most  powerful  and  cherished 
companion  of  thy  lord,  in  the  midst  of  his  burning  anxieties, 
bows  before  thee  and  wishes  thee  well." 

Hearing  of  the  welfare  of  those  two  lions  among  men,  Sita, 
trembling  with  delight,  said  to  Hanuman : — "  Verily  the  wise 
say  that  happiness  visits  a  man  even  if  it  be  at  the  end  of  a 
hundred  years." 

Thereupon  Sita  and  Hanuman  began  to  converse  with 
delight  and  mutual  confidence.  Hearing  Sita  speak  in  this 
wise,  Hanuman,  the  son  of  Maruta  drew  nearer  to  her  who 
had  been  overwhelmed  with  grief  and,  as  he  did  so,  she  grew 
apprehensive  and  reflected : — "Alas  !  Why  have  I  entered  into 
converse  with  him  ?  It  is  Ravana  in  another  guise  !  "  There- 
upon, letting  go  the  Ashoka  branch,  Maithili  of  faultless  limbs, 
exhausted  with  suffering,  sank  down  on  the  earth. 

Then  that  long-armed  monkey  bowed  unto  Janaka's  daughter, 
who,  rilled  with  terror,  did  not  dare  raise  her  eyes  to  him,  yet, 
411 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

seeing  him  bowing  humbly  before  her,  Sita,  whose  face  re- 
sembled the  moon,  sighed  deeply  and  said  to  him  in  gentle 
accents : — 

"  If  thou  art  Ravana's  self,  who  has  assumed  a  perfidious 
guise  in  order  to  increase  my  distress,  it  is  a  vile  act.  Thou 
art  he,  who,  renouncing  his  own  shape,  appeared  to  me  in 
Janasthana  as  a  mendicant,  O  Ranger  of  the  Night.  O  Thou, 
wearing  shapes  at  will,  it  doth  not  behove  thee  to  torment  me, 
who  am  distressed  and  emaciated  with  fasting. 

"  Yet  thou  canst  not  be  he  whom  I  fear,  since  my  heart 
feels  delight  in  seeing  thee.  If  thou  art  truly  Rama's  messenger, 
may  good  betide  thee !  Thou  art  welcome,  O  Best  of  Monkeys 
for  it  is  sweet  to  me  to  hear  of  Rama.  Set  forth  the  virtues  of 
Rama,  O  Monkey,  and  ravish  my  soul,  O  Gentle  One,  as  the 
current  of  a  river  bears  away  its  banks.  O  how  sweet  a  dream 
does  an  inhabitant  of  the  woods  bring  to  me  so  long  after 
mine  abduction !  If  I  might  only  see  the  valiant  Raghava 
accompanied  by  Lakshmana  once  more  but  even  a  dream 
denies  me  this  delight.  Can  it  be  a  dream  ?  To  see  a  monkey 
in  dream  does  not  give  rise  to  happiness  yet  I  am  happy  now ! 
Is  my  mind  not  deranged  or  has  fasting  disturbed  the  humours 
of  my  body  and  caused  this  delusion  or  is  it  perchance  a 
mirage  ?  Nay,  it  cannot  be  an  hallucination  for  I  am  in  full 
possession  of  my  senses  and  perceive  this  monkey  clearly." 

Such  were  the  thoughts  that  haunted  Sita,  as  also  that  the 
titans  were  able  to  change  their  form  at  will,  which  convinced 
her  that  this  was  the  King  of  the  Titans  himself.  Having 
arrived  at  this  conclusion,  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  of  slender 
waist,  ceased  to  converse  with  the  monkey  but  Hanuman, 
divining  what  was  passing  through  her  mind,  consoled  her 
with  sweet  words,  enhancing  her  delight  saying: — 

"  Bright  as  the  sun  and  like  the  moon,  beloved  of  all,  that 
sovereign  of  the  world  is  as  munificent  as  Kuvera.  In  valour 
resembling  the  glorious  Vishnu,  of  sweet  and  truthful  speech 
like  unto  Vachaspati,  handsome,  illustrious  and  fortunate 
like  the  God  of  Love,  the  just  dispenser  of  punishment  to 
evil-doers,  he  is  the  foremost  of  car-warriors  in  the  world. 

"  He  in  whose  arms  the  whole  world  takes  refuge,  that 
magnanimous  Raghava  was  lured   away  from  the  hermitage

by  means  of  Maricha  in  the  form  of  a  deer,  thus  allowing 
Havana  to  bear  thee  away.  Soon  shall  that  mighty  hero 
destroy  Havana  in  combat  with  his  fiery  shafts  discharged  in 
anger.  It  is  he,  who  has  sent  me  with  these  tidings.  Worn 
with  grief  at  thy  separation,  he  enquires  as  to  thy  welfare,  as 
also  the  highly  resplendent  Lakshmana,  enhancer  of  Sumitra's 
delight,  who  offers  salutations  to  thee.  The  king  of  the 
monkey  hosts,  Sugriva  by  name,  who  is  Rama's  friend,  also 
pays  homage  to  thee;  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sugriva  have 
thee  ever  in  mind ;  though  subject  to  the  titans,  by  good 
fortune  thou  dost  still  live,  O  Vaidehi.  Ere  long  thou  shalt 
behold  Rama  and  Lakshmana  of  the  great  car  with  Sugriva 
of  Umitless  prowess. 

"I  am  Sugriva's  minister,  the  monkey  Hanuman,  I  have 
entered  the  city  of  Lanka,  having  crossed  the  ocean,  thus 
setting  my  foot  on  the  head  of  Ravana  of  perverse  soul.  I 
have  come  here  to  see  thee,  depending  on  my  own  prowess, 
I  am  not  he  whom  thou  deemest  me  to  be.  Do  thou  renounce 
thy  doubts,  and  have  confidence  in  my  words."

Hanuman  makes  himself  known  to  Sita 

Hearing  that  lion  among  monkeys  discoursing  on  Rama, 
Vaidehi  spoke  to  him  in  sweet  and  gentle  accents,  saying : — 

"  Where  didst  thou  encounter  Rama  and  how  didst  thou 
come  to  know  Lakshmana  ?  How  did  men  and  monkeys  come 
to  form  an  alliance  ?  O  Monkey,  describe  the  distinctive 
characteristics  of  Rama  and  Lakshmana  once  again  and  so 
dispel  my  grief.  Speak  to  me  of  Rama's  grace  and  form, 
his  arms  and  thighs,  as  well  as  Lakshmana's." 

To  these  questions  of  Vaidehi,  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta, 
began  to  give  a  detailed  description  of  Rama  and  said : — 

"  By  good  fortune,  recognising  me  to  be  a  messenger  of 
Rama,  O  Vaidehi,  whose  eyes  are  as  large  as  lotus  petals,  thou 
hast  asked  me  to  describe  the  person  of  thy  lord  as  well  as  that 
413 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  Lakshmana.  O  Large-eyed  Lady,  hear  me  while  I  tell 
thee  of  those  marks  of  royalty  I  have  observed  in  the  persons 
of  Rama  and  Lakshmana.  O  Daughter  of  Janaka,  Rama  has 
eyes  like  unto  lotus  petals,  his  countenance  resembles  the 
moon  and  he  is  endowed  with  great  beauty  and  virtue.  In 
radiance  like  the  sun,  in  patience  resembling  the  earth,  in 
wisdom  like  unto  Brihaspati,  in  renown  equal  to  Vasava,  he  is 
the  protector  of  all  beings  and  the  upholder  of  his  race,  the 
guardian  of  law  and  tradition  and  the  scourge  of  his  foes. 
O  Lovely  One,  Rama  is  the  preserver  of  the  people  and  the 
four  castes,  he  inaugurates  and  establishes  the  social  order, 
he  is  worshipped  by  all  like  the  sun  and  is  an  observer  of  pious 
vows ;  he  knows  well  the  proper  time  to  pay  honour  to  holy 
men  and  is  conversant  with  the  path  of  right  action. 

"  Born  with  royal  prerogatives,  the  servant  of  the  brahmins, 
learned,  endowed  with  nobility,  humble,  he  is  the  scourge  of 
his  foes.  Versed  in  the  Yajur  Veda,  honoured  by  those  con- 
versant with  the  Vedas,  he  is  proficient  in  archery  and  possesses 
a  thorough  knowledge  of  the  Vedas  and  Vedangas.  Broad 
shouldered,  long-armed,  handsome,  possessing  a  conch-shaped 
neck  his  ribs  are  well  covered  and  muscular  and  his 
eyes  are  red ;  such  is  Rama  renowned  among  men.  The 
tone  of  his  voice  resembles  the  Dundubhi,  his  skin  is  smooth, 
his  three  limbs,  thigh,  fist  and  wrist  are  hard,  and  the  others, 
long,  his  navel,  abdomen  and  breast  are  well-proportioned 
and  high.  The  rims  of  his  eyes,  his  nails  and  palms  are  red, 
his  voice  and  gait  grave ;  there  are  three  folds  in  the  skin 
of  his  body  and  neck ;  the  lines  on  the  soles  of  his  feet  and 
breast  are  deep;  his  neck,  back  and  thighs  are  muscular; 
his  hair  is  coiled  in  three  circles ;  his  thumb  is  marked  with 
four  lines  indicating  his  deep  knowledge  of  the  Vedas ;  there 
are  four  lines  on  his  forehead,  the  sign  of  a  long  life ;  he  is 
four  cubits  in  height ;  his  arms,  thighs  and  cheeks  are  plump ; 
wrists,  knee-joints,  hips,  hands  and  feet  are  well-proportioned, 
his  four  front  teeth  have  auspicious  marks ;  his  gait  is  like  a 
lion's,  a  tiger's,  an  elephant's  or  a  bull's ;  his  lips  and  jaws 
are  fleshy,  his  nose  long,  his  face,  speech,  down  and  skin, 
cool;  his  two  arms,  little  fingers,  thighs  and  legs,  slender; 
his  countenance,  eyes,  mouth,  tongue,  lips,  palate,  breast, 
414 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

nails  and  feet  resemble  lotuses ;  his  forehead,  neck,  arms, 
navel,  feet,  back  and  ears  are  ample.  He  is  gifted  with  grace, 
renown,  and  radiance ;  his  lineage  is  pure  on  both  sides ; 
his  armpits,  abdomen,  breast,  nose,  shoulders  and  forehead 
are  elevated  ;  his  fingers,  hair,  down,  nails,  skin,  eyesight  and 
intellect,  clear  and  sharp.  Raghava  delights  in  what  is  just 
and  true,  he  is  filled  with  energy  and  is  well  able  to  judge  how 
to  act  under  all  circumstances  ;  he  is  benevolent  to  all. 

"  His  brother  Saumitri,  whose  mother  is  second  in  rank 
among  the  queens,  whose  glory  is  immeasurable,  resembles 
him  in  beauty,  devotion  and  good  qualities ;  he  is  of  a  golden 
complexion  whereas  Rama  is  dark  of  hue.  Those  two  tigers 
among  men,  who  yearn  to  see  thee  once  more,  scouring  the 
earth  for  thee,  met  with  us  in  the  forest.  Ranging  the  earth 
in  search  of  thee  they  beheld  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  who 
had  been  banished  by  his  elder  brother,  at  the  foot  of  the 
Rishyamuka  Mountain  that  is  covered  by  innumerable  trees. 
We  were  in  attendance  on  the  handsome  Sugriva,  Lord  of  the 
Monkeys,  who  had  been  driven  from  the  kingdom  by  his  elder 
brother  and,  beholding  those  foremost  of  men,  clad  in  bark, 
bearing  splendid  bows  in  their  hands,  that  monkey  fled  to  the 
summit  of  the  mountain,  distracted  with  terror.  Thereafter 
he  sent  me  out  to  meet  them  in  all  haste  and,  at  Sugriva's 
command,  I  approached  those  two  princes,  those  lions  among 
men,  with  joined  palms. 

"  Distinguished  by  their  handsome  features,  those  two 
heroes,  being  informed  of  what  had  taken  place,  were  well 
pleased  and  I,  placing  them  on  my  shoulders,  transported 
them  to  the  crest  of  the  hill  where  the  magnanimous  Sugriva 
was  to  be  found.  There  I  related  all  to  Sugriva  and  they 
conversed  together  and  a  great  friendship  grew  up  between  those 
illustrious  persons,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  and  those 
monarchs  among  men.  Then  they  comforted  each  other, 
narrating  their  respective  misfortunes  and  Lakshmana's  elder 
brother  consoled  Sugriva  who  had  been  banished  by  Bah'  of 
great  prowess  on  account  of  the  love  of  a  woman.  Thereafter, 
Lakshmana  related  the  suffering  and  loss  that  had  befallen 
Rama  to  Sugriva,  who,  hearing  this  recital  from  his  lips,  was 
bereft  of  his  radiance  like  the  sun  under  eclipse.  Then 
415 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

gathering  together  all  the  ornaments  that  thou  didst  let  fall  on 
the  earth  when  the  Titan  bore  thee  away,  the  monkeys  brought 
them  to  Rama  with  delight,  but  they  were  ignorant  of  where 
thou  wert. 

"  All  those  ornaments  which  had  fallen  tinkling  to  the  ground, 
and  had  been  collected  by  me,  I  gave  over  to  Rama,  who 
was  beside  himself  with  grief  and,  clasping  them  to  his  breast, 
that  God  of  divine  beauty,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  inflamed  with 
grief,  with  many  groans  bewailed  his  loss.  For  a  long  time 
that  magnanimous  hero  lay  crushed  under  the  weight  of  his 
affliction  and  I  addressed  many  words  of  comfort  to  him, 
persuading  him  to  rise.  Whereupon  Rama  with  Saumitri, 
gazing  again  and  again  on  those  precious  objects,  gave  them 
over  to  Sugriva.  In  thine  absence,  O  Noble  Lady,  Raghava 
is  consumed  with  grief,  like  a  volcano  burning  with  perpetual 
fire.  On  account  of  thee,  sleeplessness,  sorrow  and  care 
consume  the  magnanimous  Rama,  as  the  sacred  fires  burn 
down  a  temple  in  which  they  are  enclosed.  The  pain  of 
thy  separation  has  shattered  him  as  a  violent  earthquake 
shatters  a  great  mountain.  O  Daughter  of  a  King,  he  wanders 
among  the  enchanting  woods,  on  river  banks  and  by  the  side 
of  waterfalls  but  nowhere  finds  delight.  O  Daughter  of 
Janaka,  ere  long,  Ramachandra  will  undoubtedly  bring  about 
the  destruction  of  Ravana  with  all  his  kith  and  kin,  and  that 
foremost  of  men  will  soon  liberate  thee. 

"  It  was  thus  that  Rama  and  Sugriva  entered  into  a  friendly 
alliance  to  encompass  Bali's  destruction  and  institute  a  search 
for  thee.  Thereupon,  returning  to  Kishkindha  with  those  two 
heroic  princes,  that  lord  of  monkeys  slew  Bali  in  battle  and 
having  struck  him  down  by  his  prowess  in  fight,  Rama  made 
Sugriva  king  of  all  the  monkeys  and  bears.  Such  was  the 
alliance  between  Rama  and  Sugriva,  0  Goddess,  know  then 
that  I  am  Hanuman  who  have  come  as  their  deputy.  When 
he  had  recovered  his  kingdom,  Sugriva,  gathering  all  the 
great  and  powerful  monkeys  together,  sent  them  forth  to  every 
region  to  seek  for  thee.  Under  the  commands  of  their  king, 
Sugriva,  those  mighty  monkeys,  equal  to  the  Indra  of  Moun- 
tains, scoured  the  land  on  every  side.  Since  that  time,  in 
fear  of  Sugriva,  those  monkeys  have  been  exploring  the  whole 
416 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

earth ;  I  am  one  of  those.  The  mighty  and  illustrious  son 
of  Bali,  Angada  by  name,  set  out  with  a  third  part  of  the  army 
under  him ;  many  were  the  days  and  nights  we  spent  over- 
whelmed with  distress,  having  lost  our  way  on  the  foremost  of 
mountains,  Vindhya.  Despairing  of  accomplishing  our  pur- 
pose and  the  time  appointed  having  passed,  in  fear  of  that 
lord  of  the  monkeys,  we  resolved  to  give  up  our  lives.  Having 
searched  the  mountains  and  the  inaccessible  fastnesses,  the 
rivers  and  waterfalls  without  finding  any  trace  of  thee,  we  made 
up  our  minds  to  die.  Thereafter  we  began  our  final  fast  on 
the  summit  of  the  mountain. 

"  Submerged  in  an  ocean  of  grief,  Angada  lamented  un- 
ceasingly, reflecting  on  thine  abduction,  O  Vaidehi,  on  the 
death  of  Bali,  on  our  resolution  to  die  of  hunger  and  on  the 
death  of  Jatayu.  Whilst  we  were  fasting  thus,  waiting  for  death, 
having  given  up  all  hope  of  carrying  out  the  behests  of  our 
lord,  to  the  good  fortune  of  our  enterprise,  there  appeared, 
a  mighty  vulture,  the  brother  of  Jatayu,  by  name  Sampati. 
Hearing  of  his  brother's  death,  he  cried  out  in  anger : — 

"  *  By  whom  was  my  younger  brother  slain  and  where  does 
he  dwell  ?  I  wish  to  hear  this  from  you,  O  Excellent  Monkeys  ! ' 

"  Thereupon,  Angada  related  all  in  detail  to  him  and  how 
that  Titan  of  terrible  form  destroyed  Jatayu  on  thine  account 
in  Janasthana.  In  his  grief  for  Jatayu's  death,  that  son  of 
Aruna  told  us  that  thou  wast  to  be  found  in  Havana's  abode, 
O  Exquisite  Damsel ! 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  Sampati,  our  joy  was  extreme  and 
led  by  him  we  all  rose  up  and,  leaving  the  Vindhya  Mountain 
came  to  the  shores  of  the  sea.  There  a  cruel  anxiety  seized 
the  monkeys  anew,  eager  as  they  were  to  find  thee,  but  I  was 
able  to  dispel  that  sharp  anguish  of  the  monkey  host,  who 
beholding  the  main  had  lost  heart.  Then,  removing  their 
fear  I  leapt  a  hundred  leagues  over  the  sea  and  entered  Lanka 
by  night,  which  was  filled  with  titans;  there  I  beheld  Ravana 
and  saw  thee  overcome  with  grief,  O  Irreproachable  Lady ! 

"  Now  I  have  told  thee  all,  do  thou,  in  thy  turn  speak  to  me, 
O  Goddess  !  I  am  the  messenger  of  the  son  of  Dasaratha  and 
have  come  here  to  thee,  to  carry  out  Rama's  purpose.  Know 
me  to  be  Sugriva's  minister  and  the  Wind-god's  son !    All

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

is  well  with  thy  lord,  Kakutstha,  the  foremost  of  those  bearing 
weapons,  as  also  with  Lakshmana  possessed  of  auspicious 
marks  and  ever  engaged  in  the  worship  of  his  superiors  and 
the  well-being  of  his  lord. 

"  I  have  come  here  at  Sugriva's  command  and  have  accom- 
plished the  journey  alone.  Changing  my  form  at  will,  I  have 
scoured  the  southern  region  and,  in  my  eagerness  to  find  thee, 
have  sought  thee  on  every  side.  With  tidings  of  thee,  I  shall 
by  divine  grace  be  able  to  dispel  the  grief  of  the  monkey 
host,  who  have  been  lamenting  on  thy  account  and  my  cross- 
ing the  ocean  will  not  have  been  in  vain.  I  shall  win  renown 
for  having  found  thee,  O  Goddess  and  the  highly  powerful 
Raghava  will  rejoin  thee  without  delay,  having  first  slain 
Ravana,  the  king  of  the  Titans  with  his  sons  and  relatives. 

"  Mount  Malyavat  is  the  highest  of  mountains,  O  Vaidehi, 
and  there  dwells  my  sire,  Kesarin.  Obedient  to  the  will  of  the 
divine  Sages,  he  once  repaired  to  Gokarna  and  at  that  sacred 
spot  belonging  to  the  Lord  of  the  Rivers,  brought  about  the 
destruction  of  the  Titan,  Samvasadana.  I  was  born  of  the 
consort  of  Kesarin,  O  Maithili  and  my  name  is  Hanuman ; 
I  am  known  throughout  the  world  for  my  exploits.  To  inspire 
thee  with  confidence,  I  have  described  the  virtues  of  thy  lord. 
Ere  long,  O  Goddess,  Raghava  will  certainly  take  thee  hence." 

Reassured  by  the  proofs  given  to  her,  Sita,  exhausted  by 
suffering,  recognised  Hanuman  to  be  Rama's  messenger. 

Then  Janaki,  in  an  excess  of  joy,  allowed  tears  of  felicity  to 
fall  from  her  eyes  fringed  with  dark  lashes.  The  gentle  counten- 
ance of  that  large-eyed  damsel  with  her  reddened  eyes  shone 
like  the  moon  released  from  Rahu's  hold. 

Taking  him  for  a  real  monkey  at  last,  she  reflected  in  herself; 
"  How  could  it  be  otherwise  ?  " 

Then  Hanuman  again  addressed  that  lady  of  charming  mien, 
saying: — 

"  I  have  told  thee  all,  now  have  confidence  in  me,  O  Maithili! 
What  more  can  I  do  for  thee  and  what  is  thy  pleasure,  ere  I 
return?  When  the  Asura,  Samvasadana  was  destroyed  in 
combat  by  the  foremost  of  monkeys  at  the  behest  of  the  celestial 
sages,  I  was  born  of  Vayu,  O  Maithili,  and  though  a  monkey, 
I  am  his  equal  in  prowess  !  "

CHAPTER    36 
Sita  questions  Hanuman 

The  exceedingly  mighty  son  of  Pavana,  Hanuman,  in  order 
to  increase  Sita's  confidence  in  him,  again  addressed  her  in  re- 
assuring words,  saying : — 

"  O  Fortunate  One,  I  am  a  monkey,  the  messenger  of  the 
sagacious  Rama ;  behold  this  precious  ring  on  which  his  name 
is  engraved  !  O  Goddess,  it  was  given  to  me  by  that  magnani- 
mous hero  so  that  thou  shouldst  have  faith  in  me.  Take  heart 
therefore,  may  good  betide  thee !  Soon  shall  there  be  an  end 
to  thy  grief! " 

Then  Janata,  taking  the  jewel  that  had  adorned  the  finger 
of  her  lord,  was  overcome  with  joy,  as  if  he  himself  were 
present.  Her  gentle  countenance  with  its  large  eyes  began  to 
sparkle  with  delight  resembling  the  moon  released  from 
Rami's  hold.  Blushing  with  pleasure  on  receiving  this  token 
from  her  lord,  that  youthful  woman,  in  her  satisfaction,  began 
to  look  on  that  great  monkey  as  on  a  friend  and  paid  tribute 
to  him  in  the  following  wise : — 

"  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  verily  thou  who  have  entered  this 
city  of  Ravana's  alone,  art  full  of  courage,  valour  and  address. 
With  admirable  tenacity  thou  hast  traversed  the  ocean, 
four  hundred  miles  in  breadth,  the  abode  of  great  monsters, 
reducing  it  to  the  measure  of  a  cow's  hoof.  I  do  not  look 
on  thee  as  an  ordinary  monkey,  O  Lion  among  Forest  Dwellers, 
since  thou  dost  not  stand  in  awe  of  Ravana.  O  Best  of 
Monkeys,  thou  hast  merited  associationship  with  me,  since 
Rama  the  knower  of  Self  has  dispatched  thee  as  his  messenger. 
It  is  certain  that  the  invincible  Rama  would  never  have  sent 
thee  to  me  without  first  testing  thy  prowess.  By  good  fortune 
the  virtuous  and  truthful  Rama  as  also  the  illustrious  Laksh- 
mana,  enhancer  of  Sumitra's  delight,  are  well,  yet  if  Kakutstha 
live  untouched  by  ill,  how  is  it  that  he  does  not  burn  up  the 
419  26 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

earth  encircled  by  the  sea  in  his  wrath  like  the  fires  at  the  dis- 
solution of  the  worlds  ?  Those  two  heroes  are  able  to  subdue 
the  Gods  themselves  and  yet  they  retrain  from  action ;  I  deem 
therefore  that  my  sufferings  are  still  not  at  an  end !  Is  Rama 
not  disquieted ;  is  he  not  torn  with  anxiety  on  my  account  ? 
Is  that  son  of  a  king  making  every  preparation  to  deliver  me  ? 
Is  he  sorrowful  and  pre-occupied  ?  Has  he  lost  sight  of  his 
ultimate  purpose ;  is  he  fulfilling  his  duty  with  fortitude  ?  Is 
that  slayer  of  his  foes,  desirous  of  victory,  propitiating  his 
friends  with  forbearance  and  gifts  and  employing  the  three- 
fold means  of  dealing  with  his  enemies  ?  Does  he  show  good- 
will to  his  friends  and  have  they  confidence  in  him  ?  Does  he 
ally  himself  with  those  of  good  repute  and  do  they  pay  him 
honour  ?  Does  that  son  of  a  king  seek  the  favour  of  the  Gods; 
does  he  depend  on  them  for  his  power  and  fortune  ?  Has 
Rama's  affection  for  me  decreased  as  a  result  of  my  living  far 
from  him  ?  Will  he  deliver  me  from  this  peril  ?  Is  he  not 
unstrung  by  this  extreme  misfortune,  being  accustomed  to 
felicity  and  unused  to  adversity?  Has  he  received  frequent  good 
tidings  of  Kaushalya,  Sumitra  and  also  Bharata?  Is  not 
Raghava,  worthy  of  honour,  overcome  with  grief  at  my 
absence  ?  Is  he  reflecting  on  how  he  may  rescue  me  ?  Will  not 
Bharata,  ever  devoted  to  his  brother,  send  out  a  great  army 
led  by  experienced  generals  for  my  sake?  O  Foremost  of 
Monkeys,  will  not  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  the  fortunate 
Sugriva,  come  to  mine  aid  at  the  head  of  a  host  of  valiant 
monkeys  using  their  teeth  and  nails  ?  Will  not  the  heroic 
Lakshmana,  the  increaser  of  Sumitra's  delight,  skilled  in  the 
use  of  weapons,  destroy  the  titans  with  his  shafts  ?  Shall  I 
not  see  Rama  strike  down  Ravana  on  the  battlefield  ere  long 
with  his  friends  and  kinsfolk  by  means  of  Rudra's  weapon  ? 
Is  the  golden  countenance  of  Raghava,  fragrant  with  the  scent 
of  lotuses,  not  dimmed  under  adversity,  like  a  lotus  deprived 
of  water  under  the  burning  sun?  Does  he  still  retain  his 
fixity  of  purpose,  he  who,  for  the  sake  of  righteousness,  with- 
out regret  renounced  the  throne  and  on  foot  entered  the 
forest  with  me  ?  Neither  for  his  mother  nor  his  father  nor  for 
any  other  does  he  bear  the  love  that  he  cherishes  for  me. 
I  shall  only  live  as  long  as  I  hear  of  him,"

Having  addressed  these  words,  full  of  meaning  and  sweetness 
to  that  monkey,  that  charming  lady  became  silent  so  that  she 
might  hear  more  of  her  lord. 

And  listening  to  Sita,  Maruti,  of  immeasurable  prowess, 
with  joined  palms  paid  obeisance  to  her  and  spoke  again, 
saying: 

"  O  Illustrious  Princess,  the  lotus-eyed  Rama  does  not 
know  that  thou  art  here  and  for  this  reason  has  not  delivered 
thee  as  Purandara  rescued  Sachi.  Learning  this  from  me, 
Raghava  will  instantly  come  hither  with  his  great  army  of 
bears  and  monkeys  and,  having  triumphed  over  the  invincible 
ocean,  the  abode  of  Varuna  with  his  terrible  shafts,  Kakutstha 
will  rid  the  city  of  Lanka  of  all  the  titans.  Even  if  death 
himself  or  the  Gods  or  the  mighty  titans  seek  to  bar  bis  passage, 
he  will  destroy  them  all.  O  Princess,  in  thine  absence,  Rama 
stricken  with  grief  is  no  longer  able  to  find  rest,  like  an  elephant 
who  is  attacked  by  a  lion.  O  Goddess,  I  swear  to  thee  by 
the  Mandara,  Malava,  Vindhya,  Meru  and  Dardura  Mountains 
and  all  the  fruits  and  roots,  that  thou  shalt  soon  behold  Rama's 
lovely  countenance  with  his  beautiful  eyes,  lips  like  unto  the 
Bimba  fruit,  and  charming  earrings,  who  resembles  the  risen 
moon.  Soon  thou  shalt  see  Rama  on  Mount  Prasravana, 
O  Vaidehi,  like  Shatakratu  seated  on  Airavata.  Eschewing 
flesh  and  wine,  Rama  subsists  on  the  fruits  and  roots  of  the 
forest  alone,  carefully  prepared  by  Lakshmana  of  which  he 
partakes  at  the  fifth  period  of  the  day.  So  absorbed  is  he  in 
the  thought  of  thee  that  he  no  longer  drives  away  flies,  insects 
and  worms  from  his  body.  Sunk  in  his  reflection,  lost  in  grief, 
he  is  wholly  absorbed  in  thy  contemplation.  Rama,  the  fore- 
most among  men  no  longer  sleeps  but  should  his  eyelids 
close  in  weariness  he  starts  up  crying :  *  O  Sita  !  *  in  gentle 
accents.  Whenever  he  beholds  a  fruit  or  flower  or  any  other 
object  dear  to  women,  he  sighs  '  O  My  dear  Love !  \  O 
Goddess,  that  prince  unceasingly  calls  on  thee,  crying :  '  O 
Sita  '>  and  in  order  rind  to  thee  has  resorted  to  every  means." 

Hearing  Rama's  praises,  Sita  was  greatly  delighted,  but 
grieved  also  to  learn  of  his  pain  so  that  she  resembled  the 
autumn  moon  entering  a  dark  cloud  to  re-appear  once  more.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 
CHAPTER    37 

Sita  refuses  to  be  rescued  by  Hanuman 

The  moon-faced  Sita,  hearing  this  speech,  addressed  Hanuman 
in  words,  fraught  with  piety  and  sound  judgment : — 

"  O  Monkey,  thou  hast  revealed  to  me  that  Rama  is  wholly 
pre-occupied  with  my  remembrance  and  also  that  he  is  plunged 
in  grief,  which  is  as  nectar  mingled  with  poison.  Whether 
man  be  at  the  height  of  his  power  or  in  the  abyss  of  sorrow, 
death  draws  him  as  with  a  cord.  Living  beings  are  unable 
to  escape  their  destiny,  O  Excellent  Monkey,  behold  how  I, 
Rama  and  Saumitri  are  sunk  in  misery !  As  a  wreck  floating 
on  the  waters  seeks  to  reach  the  shore,  so  does  Raghava  seek 
to  come  to  the  end  of  his  woes. 

"  After  destroying  the  titans,  slaying  Ravana  and  laying 
Lanka  waste,  will  not  my  lord  see  me  once  again  ?  Do  thou 
tell  him  to  hasten,  for  at  the  end  of  this  year  I  must  die.  This 
is  the  tenth  month  and  two  alone  remain,  that  is  the  term 
fixed  for  me  by  that  evil  wretch,  Ravana.  His  brother  Bibi- 
shana  made  great  entreaty  to  him  to  restore  me,  but  he  paid 
no  heed  to  his  proposals.  Ravana  does  not  look  with  favour 
on  my  release  for  death  lies  in  wait  for  him,  driven  on,  as  he  is, 
by  fate.  O  Warrior,  on  her  mother's  request,  Kala,  Bibishana's 
eldest  daughter  told  me  of  this.  There  is  an  old  and  trusty 
titan,  named  Avindha,  full  of  wisdom,  virtue,  intelligence  and 
nobility,  highly  revered  by  Ravana,  who  prophesied  the  im- 
minent destruction  of  the  titans  by  Rama,  but  that  perverse 
wretch  disregarded  his  salutory  words.  O  Best  of  Monkeys, 
I  still  hope  that  my  lord  will  soon  be  re-united  with  me,  for  my 
heart  is  pure  and  Rama's  virtues  are  infinite.  He  is  endowed 
with  endurance,  courage,  compassion,  gratitude,  energy  and 
strength,  O  Monkey.  What  foe  would  not  tremble  before 
him,  who  slew  fourteen  thousand  demons  in  Janasthana  without 
his  brother's  aid  ?  That  lion  among  men  cannot  be  surpassed 
by  the  titan  warriors;  I  am  conversant  with  his  powers  as 
4» 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Sachi  is  with  Indra's.  O  Monkey,  that  sun,  Rama,  with  his 
innumerable  arrows  as  his  rays,  will  dry  up  the  lake  of  hostile 
titans ! " 

Speaking  thus,  Sita,  overwhelmed  with  grief  at  the  thought 
of  Rama,  her  face  bathed  in  tears,  was  again  addressed  by 
Hanuman,  who  said  to  her : — 

"  No  sooner  shall  I  have  spoken  to  Raghava,  than  he  will 
hasten  hither  at  the  head  of  a  powerful  army  composed  of 
bears  and  monkeys  or  shall  I  deliver  thee  this  very  day  from 
the  grasp  of  those  titans  and  these  present  afflictions  ?  Do 
thou  climb  upon  my  back,  O  Irreproachable  Lady,  and  bear- 
ing thee  on  my  shoulders,  I  will  cross  over  the  sea ;  verily  I 
am  able  to  carry  away  the  City  of  Lanka  together  with  Ravana 
himself.  This  day,  as  Anila  bears  the  sacrificial  offerings  unto 
Shakra,  I  shall  bring  thee  back  to  Raghava  on  the  Prasravana 
Mountain,  O  Maithili !  To-day  thou  shalt  behold  Rama, 
who  is  accompanied  by  Lakshmana,  preparing  to  destroy  the 
enemy,  as  Vishnu  engaged  in  the  destruction  of  the  Daityas 
and  thou  shalt  see  that  mighty  hero,  eager  to  behold  thee,  on 
that  solitary  mountain,  resembling  Purandara  on  the  head  of 
the  King  of  the  Serpents. 

"  O  Lovely  Goddess,  mount  on  my  shoulders,  do  not  hesitate 
and  be  united  with  Rama,  as  Rohini  is  restored  to  Shashanka, 
as  Sachi  to  Indra,  or  Savarshala  to  the  Sun.  I  shall  cross 
the  ocean  by  the  aerial  path !  O  Fair  One,  bearing  thee  away 
from  here,  none  of  the  dwellers  in  Lanka  will  be  able  to  follow 
me.  I  shall  return  as  I  came,  O  Vaidehi,  bearing  thee  through 
space." 

Hearing  these  astonishing  words,  Maithili,  trembling  with 
joy,  said  to  Hanuman :  "  How  canst  thou  hope  to  carry  me 
so  great  a  distance,  O  Hanuman?  This  demonstrates  thy 
monkey  nature !  How  dost  thou  deem  it  possible  that  thy 
little  body  should  convey  me  from  here  to  my  lord,  that 
king  among  men,  O  Monkey  ?  " 

At  these  words  Hanuman  reflected:  "This  is  the  first 
affront  I  have  suffered !  Vaidehi  is  unaware  of  my  prowess  and 
strength.  She  snail  learn  that  I  am  able  to  assume  any  shape 
at  will !  "  Thinking  thus,  that  foremost  of  monkeys,  Hanuman, 
the  scourge  of  his  foes,  showed  himself  to  Sita  in  his  true  form. 
423 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

In  order  to  inspire  Sita  with  confidence,  leaping  down  from 
the  tree,  that  monkey  began  to  expand  in  size  and  grew  equal 
to  the  Meru  or  Mandara  Mountain  or  a  flaming  brazier  and 
that  lion  among  monkeys,  of  a  coppery  countenance,  his  body 
like  a  mountain,  with  nails  and  teeth  like  diamonds,  standing 
before  Sita,  said : — 

"  I  am  capable  of  uprooting  Lanka  with  its  hills,  woods, 
fields,  palaces,  ramparts  and  gates  and  its  monarch  also ! 
Take  heart  therefore  O  Queen,  do  not  delay  further,  O  Vaidehi! 
Come  and  dispel  the  grief  of  Raghava  as  also  Lakshmana's." 

Seeing  the  son  of  the  Wind-god  grow  to  the  size  of  a  moun- 
tain, the  daughter  of  Janaka,  whose  eyes  resembled  lotus 
petals,  said  to  him : — 

"  O  Mighty  Monkey,  now  I  recognise  the  extent  of  thy 
powers  and  thy  speed  which  equals  the  wind,  also  thy  radiance 
like  unto  fire.  How  should  an  ordinary  monkey  have  reached 
this  land  beyond  the  infinite  ocean  ?  I  know  that  thou  art  able 
to  take  me  from  here  and  bear  me  away,  but,  O  Foremost  of 
Monkeys,  I  must  consider  if  the  consequences  are  to  mine 
advantage.  Furthermore,  is  it  fitting  for  me  to  go  with  thee  ? 
Thy  speed  equal  to  the  wind  may  render  me  giddy  and  I 
might  fall  from  thy  back  whilst  thou  wert  proceeding  high 
over  the  ocean.  Flung  into  the  sea  filled  with  sharks,  croco- 
diles and  giant  fish,  I  should  certainly  become  the  chosen  prey 
of  those  monsters.  Nay,  I  cannot  go  with  thee,  O  Destroyer 
of  Thy  Foes  and  for  thee  undoubtedly  there  is  also  grave 
danger.  When  the  titans  see  thee  bearing  me  away,  they  will 
pursue  thee  at  the  wicked  Ravana's  command  and,  surrounded 
by  those  warriors  furnished  with  spears  and  maces,  carrying 
a  woman,  thou  wilt  be  beset  with  peril,  O  Hero !  Fully  armed, 
in  great  numbers,  those  titans  would  pursue  thee,  who  art 
unarmed ;  how  couldst  thou  then  resist  them  and  protect  me  ? 
And  when  thou  art  engaged  in  combat  with  those  terrible 
demons,  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  I,  stricken  with  fear,  will 
slip  from  thy  back.  Those  terrible,  huge  and  powerful  titans 
would  then  end  by  overcoming  thee  in  the  conflict,  O  Excellent 
Monkey.  Or  turning  my  head,  whilst  thou  art  engaged  in 
fight,  I  should  fall  and  those  wicked  titans  would  bear  me 
away  and  bring  me  hither  or,  wresting  me  from  thy  grasp, 
424 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

tear  me  to  pieces.  Victory  or  defeat  is  uncertain  in  combat ! 
If  I  died  under  the  threats  of  the  titans,  O  First  of  the  Monkeys, 
all  thine  efforts  to  deliver  me  will  have  been  in  vain.  Though 
thou  art  well  able  to  destroy  all  the  titans,  Rama's  fame  would 
thereby  suffer  decrease  or  the  titans,  bearing  me  away,  would 
confine  me  in  a  secret  place  unknown  to  the  monkeys  or  to 
Rama.  Then,  all  thine  efforts  to  rescue  me  will  have  been 
fruitless,  but  if  Rama  returns  with  thee,  great  will  be  the 
chances  of  success. 

"  O  Great-armed  Warrior,  the  lives  of  Raghava,  of  his 
two  brothers  and  of  King  Sugriva  depend  on  me.  Having 
given  up  hope  of  delivering  me,  worn  out  with  grief  and 
anxiety,  those  two  brothers  with  all  the  bears  and  monkeys 
would  end  their  existence.  O  Monkey,  furthermore,  being 
wholly  devoted  to  my  lord,  I  am  unable  to  touch  the  body  of 
any  save  Rama.  When  I  was  forced  into  contact  with  Ravana's 
limbs,  I  was  helpless  and  without  a  defender  and  was  no 
longer  in  control  of  my  person.  If  Rama  comes  to  destroy 
Ravana  and  the  titans  and  takes  me  away  from  here,  it  will 
be  a  feat  worthy  of  him !  I  have  heard  of  that  hero's  great 
exploits  and  have  myself  witnessed  them,  nor  can  Devas,  Nagas 
nor  titans  equal  Rama  on  the  field  of  battle ! 

"  Who,  having  beheld  him  in  combat,  wielding  his  mar- 
vellous bow,  endowed  with  a  valour  and  strength  like  unto 
Indra's,  could  withstand  Rama  who  is  accompanied  by  Laksh- 
mana  and  who  resembles  a  fire  fanned  by  the  wind  ?  O  Fore- 
most of  Monkeys,  who  would  seek  to  oppose  Rama,  accompanied 
by  Lakshmana,  resembling  elephants  intoxicated  with  Mada 
juice,  showering  shafts  like  the  rays  of  the  sun  at  the  time  of 
the  dissolution  of  the  worlds  ?  O  Best  of  Monkeys,  do  thou 
bring  my  dear  one  and  Lakshmana  with  the  Lord  of  the 
Monkey  Hosts,  here  with  all  speed.  On  account  of  separation 
from  Rama,  I  have  long  been  consumed  with  grief,  now,  O 
Valiant  Monkey,  make  me  happy  once  more."

CHAPTER    38 

She  gives  Hanuman  her  Jewel 

Highly  gratified  by  Sita's  words,  that  lion  among  monkeys 
answered  thus : — 

"  O  Fair  Lady  of  auspicious  presence,  thou  hast  spoken 
in  accord  with  thy  feminine  nature  and  with  the  modesty  of 
one  devoted  to  her  lord  !  As  a  woman,  it  would  not  be  possible 
for  thee  to  cross  the  sea,  four  hundred  miles  in  width  on  my 
back  and  the  plea  that  thou  hast  made,  saying  '  I  may  not  touch 
the  body  of  any  save  Rama'  is  worthy  of  thee,  O  Goddess,  con- 
sort of  that  rnagnanimous  One.  Who  but  thou  would  utter 
such  words,  O  Janaki  ?  Truly  Kakutstha  shall  hear  from 
beginning  to  end  all  thou  hast  said  and  done  in  my  presence, 
O  Princess.  For  many  reasons  did  I  speak  to  thee  thus,  O  Lady, 
anxious  as  I  was  to  compass  Rama's  design,  and  my  heart 
troubled  with  feelings  of  affection.  Further  it  was  with  great 
difficulty  that  I  penetrated  into  the  City  of  Lanka  and  traversed 
the  ocean  and  debating  what  was  meet  for  me  to  do,  I  addressed 
thee  in  this  wise.  I  wished  to  bring  thee  back  to  the  one 
who  is  the  delight  of  the  House  of  Raghu  this  day !  It  was  my 
devotion  for  him  and  in  regard  for  thee,  that  I  uttered  those 
words.  As,  however,  thou  art  unable  to  come  with  me,  O 
Irreproachable  Lady,  do  thou  give  me  some  token  which  will 
inspire  Rama  with  faith  in  me." 

Being  thus  addressed  by  Hanuman,  Sita,  who  resembled 
the  daughter  of  the  Gods,  answered  him  in  feint  accents,  her 
voice  broken  with  sobs : — "  This  is  the  most  perfect  token 
thou  canst  take  to  my  dear  lord !  Do  thou  say  this  to  him : — 
*  O  Rama,  when  we  formerly  resided  at  the  foot  of  the  Chittra- 
kuta  Mountain  in  the  eastern  region,  not  fer  distant  from 
where  the  ascetics  dwelt,  in  a  place  rich  in  roots,  fruit  and 
water  near  the  river  Mandakini,  whilst  ranging  the  flowery 
groves,  redolent  with  fragrance,  thou,  having  sported  in  the 
lake,  rested  all  dripping  on  my  breast.  At  that  moment  a 
426 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

crow,  approaching,  sought  to  peck  me  and  I  threw  a  stone 
at  it ;  nevertheless  that  ferocious  devourer  of  offerings,  deter- 
mined to  wound  me,  would  not  leave  its  prey  and  in  my  wrath 
I  removed  my  girdle,  in  order  to  strike  the  bird  and  my  robe 
slipped  down.  On  seeing  this,  thou  didst  laugh  at  me,  whereat 
I  blushed  with  shame  and  indignation.  Harassed  by  that  crow, 
who  was  wild  with  hunger,  X  took  refuge  with  thee,  and  ex- 
hausted, threw  myself  into  thine  arms  as  thou  wert  seated  there. 
Though  I  was  still  vexed,  thou  didst  pacify  me  by  thy  laughter 
and  my  face  being  bathed  in  tears,  gently  dried  my  eyes ;  thus 
I  was  seen  by  thee,  greatly  enraged  by  the  crow,  O  Lord. 
Exhausted,  O  Rama,  I  slept  for  a  long  time  on  thy  breast,  and 
thou  in  thy  turn,  didst  sleep  on  mine,  O  Elder  Brother  of 
Bharata.  Then,  as  I  awoke,  that  crow  approached  me  once 
more  and,  as  I  rose  from  thine  arms,  tore  my  breast  with  its 
beak,  O  Raghava.  Thereupon,  at  the  shedding  of  blood, 
thou  didst  wake  and  beholding  my  breast  lacerated,  O  Long- 
armed  Hero,  highly  incensed  and  hissing  like  a  serpent,  thou 
didst  speak  thus  : — 

"  O  Thou,  whose  thighs  resemble  the  trunk  of  an  elephant, 
who  has  wounded  thy  breast  ?  Who  seeks  to  play  with  an  angry 
five-headed  serpent  ?  " 

"  Thereafter,  looking  round,  thou  didst  perceive  that  crow, 
who,  with  sharp  and  bloody  talons  stood  before  me.  That 
bird,  prince  of  winged  creatures,  was  the  son  of  Indra  and  with 
the  swiftness  of  the  wind,  it  disappeared  into  the  earth.  Then 
thou,  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  thine  eyes  rolling  in  fury, 
resolved  to  destroy  that  crow  and,  plucking  a  blade  of  kusha 
grass,  from  where  thou  hadst  lain,  transformed  it  into  Brahma's 
shaft  and  it  burst  into  flame,  like  unto  the  fire  of  death  before 
the  bird.  Hurling  that  fiery  brand,  it  followed  that  bird  high 
into  the  sky  and,  pursued  by  the  fiery  dart,  the  crow  flew 
this  way  and  that,  thus  traversing  many  regions  and  ranging 
through  the  Three  Worlds,  repulsed  by  his  sire  and  the  sages; 
at  last  it  sought  refuge  with  thee,  falling  on  the  earth  and 
beseeching  mercy  of  thee.  Though  worthy  of  death,  thou, 
O  Kakutstha,  ever  willing  to  succour  all  beings,  out  of  com- 
passion, spared  him.  Then,  speaking  unto  the  one  who  was 
exhausted  and  distressed,  thou  didst  say : — "  This  weapon  of 
427 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Brahma  may  never  remain  ineffective,  therefore  say  what  is 
now  to  be  done  ?  "  Then  the  crow  answered : — "  I  will  give 
up  my  right  eye,"  whereupon  Ramachandra  destroyed  the 
right  eye  of  that  crow.  Having  sacrificed  the  right  eye,  his 
life  was  spared  and,  paying  obeisance  to  Rama,  as  also  to 
King  Dasaratha,  the  crow,  delivered  by  that  warrior,  returned 
to  his  abode.  O  Thou,  who,  on  my  behalf,  didst  discharge  the 
Brahma-weapon,  even  at  a  crow,  why  dost  thou  leave  him  who 
bore  me  away,  unpunished  ?  O  Foremost  of  Men,  show  thy 
compassion  to  me  and  inspire  me  with  hope.  I  am  conversant 
with  thy  great  energy,  thine  immense  endurance,  thine  amazing 
strength,  thine  irresistible  power  unfettered  by  the  limitations 
of  time  and  space,  incapable  of  being  disturbed,  thou  who  art 
deep  like  the  ocean,  lord  of  the  earth  and  the  equal  of  Vasava 
himself !  Thou,  the  first  among  bowmen,  who  art  full  of  ardour, 
and  courage,  wherefore  dost  thou  not  direct  thy  weapons  against 
the  titans  ?  Neither  Nagas,  Gandharvas,  Gods  nor  Maruts  can 
resist  thee  in  combat  \ 

"  If  that  warrior  still  retains  any  regard  for  me,  why  does  he 
not  exterminate  the  titans  with  his  whetted  shafts,  or  why 
does  not  Lakshmana,  the  repressor  of  his  foes,  endowed  with 
energy,  deliver  me  at  his  brother's  behest  ?  Since  those  two 
tigers  among  men,  equal  to  Vayu  and  Indra  are  invincible 
even  against  the  Celestials,  why  do  they  disregard  me  ? 

"  Alas !  I  must  be  guilty  of  some  heinous  sin,  since  those 
twin  scourges  of  their  foes,  though  able  to  do  so,  fail  to  come 
to  my  rescue !  " 

Hearing  Vaidehi's  piteous  words,  uttered  with  her  eyes  full 
of  tears,  the  mighty  Hanuman,  foremost  of  the  monkeys, 
said : — "  O  Exalted  One,  I  swear  to  thee  that  Rama's  features 
are  altered  on  account  of  the  sorrow  he  feels  for  thee  and, 
seeing  his  brother  overwhelmed  with  grief,  Lakshmana  too  is 
rilled  with  distress,  this  is  the  truth,  O  Goddess.  Since  I 
have  now  found  thee,  there  is  no  cause  to  lament  further  and 
thou  shalt  soon  see  an  end  to  thy  woes,  O  Lovely  One.  Those 
two  tigers  among  men,  those  princes  of  incalculable  energy, 
in  their  eagerness  to  see  thee,  will  burn  the  worlds  to  ashes. 
Having  slain  that  formidable  warrior,  Ravana  with  his  kinsfolk, 
Raghava  shall  return  with  thee  to  the  palace.

"  Now  tell  me  what  I  shall  say  to  Rama  and  Lakshmana, 
who  are  filled  with  valour  and  the  illustrious  Sugriva  and  all 
the  assembled  monkeys  ?  " 

Hanuman  having  uttered  these  words,  Sita  answered  him 
saying : — 

"  Bowing  low  to  that  Lord  of  the  World,  enquire  after  the 
welfare  of  that  protector  of  men,  whom  Kaushalya  has  brought 
forth  and  wish  him  all  prosperity  from  me.  Then  offer 
salutations  to  the  one  of  whom  Sumitra  is  the  happy  mother, 
he,  who  renounced  garlands,  jewels,  his  beloved  consort,  the 
dominion  of  a  vast  realm  hard  to  attain  and  his  father  and 
mother,  after  bidding  them  a  tender  farewell,  in  order  to 
follow  Rama.  That  virtuous  prince,  who,  in  his  devotion, 
sacrificed  unsurpassed  felicity,  accompanied  his  brother 
Kakutstha  to  the  forest,  watching  over  him ;  he  who  is  great, 
wise  and  pleasing  to  look  upon,  possessing  broad  shoulders 
and  who  looks  on  Rama  as  his  father  and  reverences  me  as  his 
mother,  that  valiant  Lakshmana,  who  did  not  know  that  I  was 
being  borne  away.  Full  of  deference  for  the  aged,  dignified 
and  brave,  measured  in  speech,  the  foremost  of  those  dear 
unto  that  king's  son  and  worthy  of  his  father-in-law,  he  who 
even  undertaketh  these  tasks  to  which  he  is  not  equal,  whose 
presence  causes  Rama  to  forget  his  sire,  who  is  dearer  to  him 
than  I ;  Lakshmana,  the  brother  of  Rama,  to  him  do  thou 
offer  obeisance  from  me  and  repeat  my  words  to  him.  May 
that  noble  and  virtuous  one,  beloved  of  Rama,  ever  mild  and 
pure,  bring  an  end  to  my  sufferings,  O  Best  of  Monkeys !  O 
Chief  of  the  Monkeys,  do  thou  bring  about  the  success  of 
this  undertaking.  May  Rama,  on  thine  instigation,  make  a 
supreme  effort  on  my  behalf.  Further,  do  thou  repeat  these 
words  of  mine  again  and  again  to  him : — 

"  '  I  have  but  one  month  to  live,  O  Son  of  Dasaratha !  After 
that  month  I  shall  die ;  I  swear  to  thee  that  this  is  the  truth  I 
speak !  Deliver  me  from  the  hands  of  that  cruel  and  wicked 
Ravana,  O  Hero,  as  Kaushiki  was  delivered  from  hell  V* 

Saying  this,  Sita  drew  from  her  robe  the  pearl  which  formerly 
adorned  her  forehead,  which  shone  with  celestial  radiance, 
and  bestowing  it  on  Hanuman,  said :  "  Give  this  to 
Raghava."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Then  the  valiant  Hanuman,  taking  the  priceless  jewel,  placed 
it  on  his  finger,  it  being  too  small  for  his  arm  and,  that  foremost 
of  monkeys,  having  received  the  pearl,  paid  obeisance  to  Sita, 
circumambulating  her  from  left  to  right.  Filled  with  delight 
on  having  found  the  princess,  Hanuman  had  already  returned 
to  Rama  and  Lakshmana  in  thought. 

And  taking  that  costly  and  superb  ornament  that  the  daughter 
of  King  Janaka  had  carried  carefully  concealed  in  her  sari, 
Hanuman,  as  if  delivered  from  a  hurricane  that  had  overtaken 
him  on  a  high  mountain,  his  heart  full  of  serenity,  once  more 
prepared  to  set  out  on  his  return  journey. 


chapter   39 

Hanuman  calms   Sita's  Fears 

Having  given  the  jewel  to  Hanuman,  Sita  said  to  him : — 

'*  This  token  is  well  known  to  Raghava  and  seeing  this  pearl, 
the  valiant  Rama  will  call  three  people  to  mind,  my  mother, 
myself  and  King  Dasaratha.  O  Best  of  Monkeys,  thy  heroism 
being  further  stimulated  by  this  enterprise,  consider  carefully 
what  fresh  efforts  are  needed ;  thou  art  capable  of  under- 
taking this  task,  think  therefore  what  course  Rama  should 
adopt  to  bring  my  misfortunes  to  an  end.  O  Hanuman  seek 
by  thine  exertions  to  terminate  my  sufferings  ! " 

Thereupon  the  son  of  the  Wind-god  of  immense  energy, 
replied :  "  So  be  it,"  and  making  obeisance  to  Vaidehi,  pre- 
pared to  depart,  but  that  exalted  one,  Videha's  daughter, 
seeing  Hanuman  about  to  leave,  her  voice  strangled  with  sobs, 
said  unto  him : — 

"  O  Hanuman,  do  thou  communicate  my  desires  for  the 
happiness  of  Rama,  Lakshmana,  Sugriva,  his  ministers  and  all 
the  other  monkeys  and,  O  Best  of  Monkeys,  in  consonance 
with  righteousness,  wish  them  well.  It  behoveth  thee  to  do 
that  which  will  cause  the  long-armed  Rama  to  deliver  me 
from  the  ocean  of  affliction  in  which  I  am  plunged.  O 
Hanuman,  do  thou  speak  so  that  the  illustrious  Rama  rescue 
430 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

me  from  here  while  I  am  yet  alive  and  thereby  reap  the  fruits 
of  virtue.  Listening  to  that  which  thou  shalt  relate  to  him 
of  me,  that  son  of  Dasaratha,  ever  filled  with  valour,  will  feel 
his  daring  increased  a  hundredfold  in  the  thought  of  reunion 
with  me.  The  heroic  Rama,  hearing  the  appeal  I  have  charged 
thee  to  deliver  to  him  will  be  inspired  to  display  increasing 
prowess." 

Listening  to  Sita's  words,  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta,  with 
joined  palms,  made  answer  to  her  saying : — 

"  Soon  shall  Kakutstha,  surrounded  by  the  foremost  monkeys 
and  bears,  come,  and  vanquishing  his  enemies  in  fight,  dispel 
thy  grief.  I  know  of  none  among  mortals,  titans  or  Gods, 
who  can  withstand  him  when  he  discharges  his  arrows.  Wert 
thou  the  price  of  victory,  he  would  be  able  to  challenge  the 
Sun  or  Parjanya  or  Vaivasvata  or  Yama  himself  in  conflict 
and  would  prepare  to  conquer  the  whole  earth  that  is  bounded 
by  the  sea,  O  Delight  of  Janaka." 

Hearing  these  pleasing,  true  and  sweetly  expressed  words, 
Janaki  addressed  Hanuman  with  respect,  who  had  spoken  out 
of  devotion  to  his  master,  and  said : — "  O  Hero,  if  thou 
judgest  it  to  be  wise,  then  tarry  here  for  one  day  more  and, 
having  rested  in  some  hidden  spot,  set  out  to-morrow !  Thy 
presence,  O  Monkey,  will  cause  me  to  forget  my  great  mis- 
fortune awhile,  I  who  have  experienced  so  little  happiness. 
But  shouldst  thou  depart  to-day,  O  Lion  among  Monkeys, 
my  life  will  be  in  danger  till  thy  return,  this  is  certain.  Further- 
more, not  seeing  thee  will  prove  an  increased  torment,  afflicted 
as  I  am  with  grief  and,  O  Hero,  this  doubt  haunts  me  con- 
tinually,— '  How  will  that  powerful  King,  in  the  midst  of  the 
forces  of  his  monkeys  and  bears  and  those  two  sons  of  a 
monarch,  cross  the  impassable  ocean  ? '  In  all  the  worlds, 
three  beings  alone  have  the  power  to  traverse  the  sea ; 
Garuda,  thou  and  Maruta  !  In  the  face  of  this  insurmountable 
obstacle,  what  means  to  success  canst  thou  see,  O  Most  Skilled 
of  Beings?  Undoubtedly  thou  art  able  to  encompass  this 
undertaking  unaided,  O  Destroyer  of  Hostile  Warriors  but 
thou  alone  wouldst  then  reap  the  glory.  If  Rama,  however, 
together  with  his  armies  vanquished  Ravana  and,  delivering 
me,  returned  to  his  own  city,  that  exploit  would  be  worthy 
43* 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  him.  If,  crossing  the  sea  and  besieging  Lanka,  that  destroyer 
of  hostile  forces  Kakutstha,  bore  me  hence,  he  would  have 
accomplished  what  is  natural  to  him.  Do  thou  therefore  act 
in  such  wise  that  that  valiant  warrior  may  be  able  to  manifest 
his  prowess ! " 

Hearing  these  words,  fraught  with  sense  and  reason,  full  of 
affection,  Hanuman  replied  mildly : — 

"  O  Queen,  the  leader  of  the  forces  of  bears  and  monkeys, 
Sugriva,  full  of  energy,  has  resolved  to  liberate  thee.  Sur- 
rounded by  millions  of  monkeys,  that  destroyer  of  titans  will 
come  hither  without  delay.  There  are,  under  his  command, 
monkeys  endowed  with  valour,  energy  and  extreme  prowess, 
swift  as  thought,  able  to  go  upward  or  downward  and  to  every 
side,  nothing  can  impede  their  course,  no  task,  however  hard, 
defeats  their  immeasurable  courage.  Nay,  more  than  once, 
by  their  amazing  endurance,  they  have  encircled  the  entire 
earth  with  its  seas  and  mountains  on  every  side,  by  resorting 
to  the  wind's  path.  Among  those  Rangers  of  the  Woods, 
some  are  equal  to  me  and  some  superior  and,  in  the  whole  of 
Sugriva's  company,  there  is  none  who  is  less  so.  Since  I 
have  reached  this  place,  how  much  more  are  those  valiant 
monkeys  able  to  do  so !  Nor  are  the  superior  ones  sent  on 
errands  but  those  of  less  account.  O  Queen,  have  no 
anxiety  and  abandon  thy  grief;  with  a  single  bound,  those  fore* 
most  of  monkeys  will  reach  Lanka  and  those  two  brothers, 
resembling  the  sun  and  moon  about  to  rise,  will  speed  to  thy 
side,  riding  on  my  back.  Having  slain  Ravana  and  his  hordes, 
Raghava,  the  delight  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  will  take  hold  of 
thee,  O  Lady  of  Lovely  Limbs,  in  order  to  bring  thee  back 
to  thine  own  city.  Therefore  let  courage  and  happiness  attend 
thee,  have  faith  in  the  dawning  of  that  hour ;  ere  long,  thou 
shalt  behold  Rama  shining  like  a  flame. 

"  That  Indra  of  the  Titans,  his  sons,  counsellors  and  kinsfolk, 
being  slain,  thou  shalt  be  re-united  with  Rama  as  Shashanka 
with  Rohini.  Soon  thou  shalt  see  the  end  of  thy  woes,  O 
Divine  Maithili,  and  Ravana  will  fall  under  Rama's  blows 
before  thine  eyes  I  " 

Having  thus  sought  to  comfort  Videha's  daughter,  Hanuman, 
born  of  Maruta,  preparing  to  depart,  spoke  yet  again,  saying : — 
433 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

"  Thou  shalt  soon  behold  the  destroyer  of  his  foes,  Raghava 
of  subdued  soul,  as  also  Lakshmana,  bearing  his  bow  in  his 
hand  at  the  gates  of  Lanka.  Ere  long  thou  shalt  see  those 
valiant  monkeys,  endowed  with  the  courage  of  lions  and  tigers, 
resembling  the  lord  of  elephants,  fighting  with  their  nails  and 
teeth.  O  Noble  One,  innumerable  companies  of  monkeys 
will  be  seen  by  thee,  resembling  hills  or  clouds,  roaring  on 
the  plateaus  of  Malaya  and  Lanka.  Like  an  elephant  attacked 
by  a  lion,  Rama  is  deeply  wounded  by  the  formidable  shafts 
of  the  God  of  Love !  O  Goddess,  weep  no  more,  but  banish 
fear  and  sorrow  from  thy  heart ;  thou  shalt  be  reunited  with 
thy  consort,  O  Beautiful  One,  as  Sachi  was  to  Indra. 

"  Who  can  overcome  Rama  ?  Who  is  equal  to  Saumitri  ? 
Those  two  brothers,  resembling  the  wind  and  fire,  are  thy 
support.  O  Goddess,  thou  shalt  no<  have  to  dwell  long  in  this 
place  inhabited  by  formidable  titans ;  thy  beloved  will  not 
delay  his  coming ;  have  patience  till  I  return !  " 


chapter   40 

He  takes  leave  of  Sita 

Hearing  the  words  of  that  magnanimous  son  of  Vayu,  Sita, 
who  resembled  a  daughter  of  the  Gods,  replied  in  significant 
words,  saying : — 

"As  the  rain,  ripening  the  grain,  rejoiceth  the  earth,  so  am 
I  gladdened  on  seeing  thee,  O  Monkey,  who  speaketh  sweetly 
of  my  beloved.  In  compassion  for  me,  who  am  emaciated 
with  suffering,  do  that  which  will  enable  me  to  meet  with  that 
tiger  among  men,  soon.  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  call  to  his 
remembrance,  that  reed  the  crow  destroyed  in  his  anger, 
having  been  deprived  of  an  eye  and  also  how,  when  my  tilaka 
mark  was  effaced,  he  painted  another  on  my  cheek,  which  he 
will  surely  remember.  Say :  '  O  Thou  who  resemblest  Indra, 
how,  with  thy  valour,  canst  thou  suffer  Sita  to  be  borne  away 
and  set  in  the  midst  of  the  titans  ?  That  celestial  pearl  which 
433 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

adorned  my  forehead,  I  have  preserved  with  care.  In  my 
misfortunes,  I  have  oft  looked  on  it  with  delight  as  on  thyself, 

0  Irreproachable  Hero !  Yielding  up  this  jewel,  I  shall  not 
live  long,  being  overwhelmed  with  grief.  For  thy  sake,  O 
Rama,  I  endure  insufferable  misery  and  the  menaces  of  the 
titans  which  cleave  my  heart !  O  Destroyer  of  thy  Foes,  I 
shall  live  for  one  more  month,  after  which,  bereft  of  thee, 

1  shall  yield  up  my  life.  The  King  of  the  Titans  is  a  source 
of  dread  to  me ;  if  I  learn  that  thou  dost  hesitate  in  coming 
to  mine  aid,  I  shall  instantly  give  up  my  life '." 

Witnessing  Vaidehi's  tears  and  lamentations,  the  mighty 
Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta,  answered : — 

"  O  Goddess,  thy  misfortunes  have  rendered  Rama's  features 
wan,  I  swear  to  thee  this  is  the  truth  and  seeing  Rama  overcome 
with  sorrow,  Lakshmana  too  is  deeply  distressed.  Now  that 
I  have  found  thee,  there  is  no  cause  for  despair !  Soon,  soon, 
thou  shalt  see  an  end  to  thy  woes,  O  Lovely  Princess !  Those 
blameless  princes,  foremost  of  men,  eager  to  see  thee,  will 
reduce  Lanka  to  ashes.  Having  slain  Ravana  in  combat, 
those  two  scions  of  the  House  of  Raghu  will  take  thee  back 
to  their  own  city,  O  Large-eyed  Lady !  O  Irreproachable 
Damsel,  it  is  now  for  thee  to  give  me  such  a  token,  that  Rama 
will  instantly  recognise  and  that  will  delight  his  heart." 

Sita  answered : — "  I  have  already  furnished  thee  with  an 
excellent  token.  Seeing  that  jewel,  Rama  will  instantly  believe 
thy  words.*' 

Receiving  the  marvellous  pearl,  the  Prince  of  the  Monkeys 
inclined  his  head  to  that  exalted  one  and  prepared  to  depart 

Beholding  that  foremost  of  monkeys  expanding  bis  form 
and,  charged  with  energy,  preparing  to  leap,  her  face  bathed 
in  tears,  in  a  voice  choked  with  sobs,  Sita  said  to  him : — 

"  O  Hanuman,  do  not  fail  to  offer  my  good  wishes  for  their 
welfare  to  those  two  brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  who 
resemble  two  lions  and  to  Sugriva  also  and  his  court.  Do 
that  which  will  cause  the  long-armed  Raghava  to  deliver  me 
from  this  ocean  of  affliction,  where  I  am  held  prisoner.  On 
thy  return,  when  thou  art  near  him,  tell  him  of  my  harsh  and 
bitter  affliction  and  the  threats  of  the  titans  !  May  prosperity 
attend  thee,  O  Chief  of  the  Monkeys." 

434 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Having  received  these  instructions  from  the  princess,  the 
monkey,  his  purpose  accomplished,  exceedingly  exultant, 
reflecting  that  little  remained  for  him  to  do,  had  already  crossed 
the  northern  region  in  thought. 


chapter   4  I 

Hanuman  destroys  the  Ashoka  Grove 

Having  been  honoured  by  Sita,  the  monkey,  leaving  that 
place,  began  to  reflect  on  what  little  remained  for  him  to  do 
since  he  had  discovered  that  dark-eyed  Princess. 

Dismissing  the  three  means  to  success,  the  fourth  now 
appeared  to  him  as  appropriate  and  he  reflected  in  himself: 
"  Because  of  their  nature,  one  may  not  enter  into  negotiation 
with  the  titans  nor  do  gifts  avail  with  the  wealthy ;  one  is 
unable  to  sow  dissension  among  those  who  are  proud  of  their 
strength,  there  remains  therefore  prowess  as  applicable  here. 
In  these  circumstances,  valour  is  the  only  resource.  When 
these  titans  see  the  foremost  of  their  warriors  fall  in  combat, 
their  martial  ardour  will  be  subdued.  He  who  accomplishes 
his  main  purpose  and  compasses  innumerable  other  engage- 
ments without  jeopardising  the  original  enterprise,  is  a  skilful 
messenger.  He  who  employs  all  his  resources  to  execute  a 
minor  task,  has  no  sagacity,  but  the  one  who  uses  countless 
means  with  the  minimum  effort,  is  wise.  Though  my  mission 
has  been  fulfilled,  yet  if,  returning  to  the  abode  of  the  King 
of  the  Monkeys,  I  have  ascertained  the  strength  of  the  foe 
and  ourselves  in  the  field,  I  shall  have  truly  carried  out  his 
commands.  How  shall  I  act  so  that  my  presence  here  proves 
fruitful  ?  How  can  I  provoke  an  encounter  with  the  titans  and 
what  can  I  do  so  that  that  Ten-necked  One  will  be  made  to 
measure  his  strength  with  mine  own?  Coming  face  to  face  with 
Dashagriva  on  the  field  accompanied  by  his  counsellors,  his 
army  and  charioteer,  I  shall  easily  read  his  intentions  and 
then  take  my  leave. 

435  2F 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  I  shall  now  proceed  to  lay  waste  this  magnificent  grove, 
resembling  the  Nandana  Gardens,  that  ravishes  the  eye 
and  where  every  variety  of  tree  and  creeper,  is  found,  as  the 
forest  fire  consumes  the  dead  trees  and  this  destruction  will 
incite  Ravana's  fury.  Thereafter  the  King  of  the  Titans 
will  call  upon  his  immense  army  furnished  with  tridents  and 
iron  pikes,  and  the  horsemen,  chariots  and  elephants,  of  which  it 
is  composed,  and  a  formidable  struggle  will  ensue.  Then  I  shall 
fight  with  all  my  strength  against  those  titans  and  having 
defeated  the  assembled  forces  of  Ravana,  I  shall  return  safely 
to  the  King  of  the  Monkeys." 

Thinking  thus,  Maruti,  like  a  raging  tempest,  with  immense 
energy  began  to  root  up  the  trees  with  his  powerful  and 
sinuous  thighs,  breaking  them  down,  as  also  the  creepers  of 
that  grove,  where  the  trumpeting  of  maddened  elephants  could 
be  heard. 

With  its  trees  uprooted,  its  foundations  shattered,  the  crests 
of  the  hills  broken  away  and  all  that  was  fair  laid  waste,  the 
copper-tinted  buds,  the  trees  and  creepers  withering  away, 
that  grove  appeared  as  if  a  fire  had  consumed  it  and  the 
flowering  sprays  blown  hither  and  thither,  resembled  women 
with  their  robes  in  disarray.  With  its  grassy  dells  and  charm- 
ing pavilions  ruined,  tiger,  deer  and  birds  emitting  cries  of 
fear  and  the  edifices  crumbling,  that  great  demesne  was  bereft 
of  beauty.  And  that  grove,  belonging  to  the  women  of  the 
inner  apartments,  where  they  were  wont  to  sport,  with  its 
avenues  of  Ashoka  trees  and  its  creepers,  now  laid  waste  by 
that  monkey,  was  transformed  by  him  into  a  heap  of  ruins. 

Then  having  given  that  powerful  lord  of  the  earth  cause  for 
severe  displeasure,  that  monkey,  eager  to  fight  against  those 
countless  valiant  titans  single-handed,  stationed  himself  at  the 
gate,  blazing  with  effulgence. 


CHAPTER    42 

He  destroys  the  Kinkaras 

Meanwhile  the  cries  of  birds  and  the  crash  of  falling  trees, 
struck  terror  into  the  hearts  of  the  inhabitants  of  Lanka.    Wild 


436 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

beasts  and  birds  fled  hither  and  thither  in  terror  on  every  side 
and  inauspicious  omens  appeared. 

Waking  from  sleep,  those  grim-visaged  titan  women  beheld 
the  grove  devastated  by  that  mighty  and  heroic  monkey  and, 
in  order  to  inspire  them  with  fear,  that  long-armed  one,  full 
of  energy,  began  to  increase  in  size  and  they,  observing  that 
immense  ape,  as  high  as  a  hill,  of  unimagined  power,  enquired 
of  Janaka's  daughter,  saying : — 

"  Who  is  this  being  ?  From  whence  and  wherefore  has  he 
come  hither  ?  Why  did  he  converse  with  thee  ?  Tell  us,  O 
Large-eyed  Lady,  have  no  fear  O  Dark-eyed  Lovely  One." 

Thereupon,  the  virtuous  Sita,  of  faultless  limbs,  answered 
them  saying : — "  Since  the  titans  are  able  to  change  their  form 
at  will,  by  what  means  should  I  be  able  to  recognise  them? 
Ye  know  what  he  is  and  what  he  is  about !  Without  doubt, 
serpents  know  the  secret  of  the  serpent's  tail !  As  for  me, 
I  am  terrified  nor  do  I  know  what  he  is  but  believe  him  to  be 
a  titan,  who  has  come  hither,  able  to  change  his  form  at 
will." 

Hearing  Vaidehi's  words,  the  titan  women  fled  with  all 
speed,  a  few  only  remaining,  whilst  some  hastened  to  inform 
Ravana  of  what  had  taken  place. 

Thereafter  those  female  titans  of  hideous  aspect,  approached 
the  King  of  the  Titans  and  informed  him  of  that  monstrous 
and  formidable  monkey  in  the  Ashoka  grove,  saying : — 

"  O  King,  there  is  a  monkey  of  immense  size,  endowed  with 
immeasurable  strength,  who,  having  held  converse  with  Sita, 
remains  there.  We  besought  the  daughter  of  Janaka  whose 
eyes  resemble  a  doe*s,  to  inform  us  who  this  monkey  was 
but  she  would  not  disclose  it.  It  may  be  that  he  is  an  emissary 
of  Indra  or  Kuvera  or  even  of  Rama  himself,  who  is  anxious 
to  discover  where  Sita  is.  This  being  of  strange  aspect,  has 
completely  destroyed  thy  wonderful  pleasure  garden  that  was 
filled  with  beasts  of  every  kind.  There  is  not  a  single  quarter 
that  has  not  been  laid  waste  by  him,  save  the  place  where  the 
divine  Janaki  abides,  whether  to  preserve  her  or  for  reasons  of 
exhaustion,  we  know  not,  but  since  he  is  a  stranger  to  fatigue, 
we  deem  it  is  on  account  of  this  woman.  And  the  Ashoka 
tree,  covered  with  buds  and  lovely  foliage,  under  the  shade 
437 


THE  RAMAYANA  OF  VALMIKI 
of  which  Sita  is  sheltering,  has  been  spared  by  him.  It 
behoveth  thee  to  inflict  some  severe  penalty  on  this  formidable 
being,  who  has  held  converse  with  Sita  and  destroyed  the 
grove.  O  Lord  of  the  Hosts  of  Titans,  who  would  dare  to 
converse  with  her  for  whom  thine  heart  yearns  without  suffer- 
ing death  ?  " 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  demons,  Ravana,  the  King  of  the 
Titans,  his  eyes  rolling  in  rage,  flamed  up  like  a  funeral  pyre 
and,  in  his  wrath  tears  fell  from  his  eyes  like  drops  of  burning 
oil  from  a  lighted  lamp. 

Then  that  mighty  monarch  ordered  those  titans  named 
Kinkaras,  whose  strength  equalled  his  own,  to  seize  Hanuman 
whereupon  eighty  thousand  of  those  retainers  speedily  issued 
from  the  palace,  bearing  maces  and  iron  hooks  in  their  hands. 
Possessing  huge  stomachs  and  large  teeth,  formidable  to  look 
upon,  filled  with  valour  and  martial  ardour,  they  were  all 
burning  to  lay  hold  of  that  monkey.  Approaching  Hanuman 
who  was  standing  at  the  gate  ready  to  fight,  those  powerful 
titans  rushed  upon  him  like  moths  on  a  flame.  Equipped 
with  maces  of  different  kinds  and  gold-encircled  bracelets, 
with  arrows  bright  as  the  sun,  hammers,  axes,  spears,  darts 
and  lances,  they  surrounded  Hanuman  and  began  their  attack. 
Then  he,  full  of  strength  and  courage,  resembling  a  hill,  lashing 
his  tail,  began  to  roar,  waving  it  to  and  fro,  and  expanding  in 
size,  that  son  of  the  Wind-god  filled  Lanka  with  his  bellowing. 
On  account  of  the  noise  of  the  swishing  of  his  tail  and  his 
roaring,  the  birds  began  to  fall  from  the  air  and  he  proclaimed 
in  a  loud  voice : — "  Victory  to  the  mighty  Rama  and  the  valiant 
Lakshmana  !  Victory  to  Sugriva,  protected  by  Raghava !  I 
am  the  servant  of  the  Sovereign  of  Koshala,  Rama,  of  im- 
perishable exploits,  I  am  Hanuman,  the  destroyer  of  hostile 
armies,  the  offspring  of  Maruta.  A  thousand  Ravanas  cannot 
stand  before  me  in  combat,  when  I  crush  them  beneath  a 
myriad  trees  and  rocks !  Under  the  very  eyes  of  the  titans, 
I  shall  destroy  the  City  of  Lanka  and,  paying  obeisance  to 
Maithili,  depart,  my  purpose  being  accomplished  1 " 

On  hearing  his  shouts,  the  titans  were  seized  with  terror 
and  they  beheld  him  standing  aloft  like  a  great  evening  cloud 
and,  knowing  now  that  that  monkey  had  been  despatched  by 
438 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

his  master,  under  the  command  of  their  lord  they  began  to 
assail  him  on  all  sides  with  every  kind  of  formidable  weapon. 

Surrounded  by  those  warriors,  that  mighty  monkey  seized 
hold  of  an  iron  bar  that  stood  near  the  gate,  and  lifting  it, 
struck  those  Rangers  of  the  Night,  and  he  appeared  like  Vinata's 
offspring  carrying  away  a  struggling  serpent.  Grasping  the 
weapon,  that  valiant  monkey  began  to  destroy  those  demons, 
moving  here  and  there  in  the  air,  as  Indra  of  a  thousand  eyes 
crushed  the  Daityas  with  his  thunderbolt. 

Having  slain  the  titans,  that  heroic  and  powerful  son  of 
Maruta,  thirsting  for  combat,  stationed  himself  at  the  gate. 

Thereafter  the  few  titans,  who  had  escaped,  informed  Ravana 
of  the  destruction  of  his  servants  and,  hearing  that  a  mighty  host 
of  demons  had  been  slain,  the  king,  bis  eyes  rolling  in  wrath, 
commanded  the  son  of  Prahasta,  who  was  endowed  with 
matchless  courage,  invincible  in  battle,  to  go  forth. 


CHAPTER   43 

He  burns  the  Temple  and  Monument 

Having  slain  the  Kinkaras,  Hanuman,  reflecting  awhile, 
thought  to  himself : — "  I  have  laid  waste  the  grove  but  I  have 
not  destroyed  the  sacred  temple,  I  shall  now  demolish  this 
sanctuary." 

Thinking  thus,  the  son  of  Maruta,  displaying  his  prowess, 
bounded  to  the  temple  that  was  as  high  as  the  peak  of  Mount 
Meru,  and  scaling  that  edifice,  that  resembled  a  mountain, 
that  chief  of  the  monkeys,  manifested  a  great  effulgence, 
equal  to  the  radiance  of  the  sunrise.  Thereafter  he  began  to 
destroy  that  lofty  sanctuary  which  shone  with  a  glory  equal 
to  the  Pariyatra  Mountain.  Assuming  immense  proportions, 
the  illustrious  son  of  Maruta,  in  his  intrepidity,  caused  Lanka 
to  tremble,  filling  it  with  his  roaring  and,  at  that  terrifying  and 
deafening  clamour,  the  birds  and  the  guardians  of  the  temple, 
fell  to  the  ground,  their  senses  overcome. 
439 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Thereupon  Hanuman  cried  out :  "  Victory  to  Rama,  skilled 
in  the  use  of  weapons  and  to  the  courageous  Lakshmana  ! 
Victory  to  King  Sugriva,  Rama's  henchman  !  I  am  Hanuman, 
the  destroyer  of  hostile  armies,  son  of  Maruta,  and  the  servant 
of  Rama,  King  of  Koshala,  of  immortal  exploits !  When  I 
hurl  down  trees  and  rocks,  not  even  a  thousand  Ravanas  can 
withstand  me  in  combat.  Having  destroyed  the  City  of  Lanka 
and  paid  my  obeisance  to  the  daughter  of  the  King  of  Mithila, 
my  purpose  fulfilled,  I  shall  depart." 

Having  spoken  thus,  the  colossal  leader  of  the  monkeys, 
standing  on  that  edifice,  emitted  a  roar  and  the  hideous  clamour 
struck  terror  into  the  hearts  of  the  titans. 

In  consequence  of  that  great  tumult,  a  hundred  temple  guards 
sallied  forth,  bearing  every  kind  of  weapon,  dart,  scimitar, 
arrow  and  axe ;  and  surrounding  Maruti  struck  him  with 
clubs  and  bars  encircled  with  golden  bands.  Hurling  them- 
selves on  that  excellent  monkey  with  arrows  bright  as  the  sun, 
that  host  of  titans  resembled  a  mighty  whirlpool  in  the  Ganges. 

Thereat  the  son  of  the  Wind,  the  mighty  Hanuman,  waxing 
wrath,  taking  on  a  formidable  aspect  and  tearing  up  from  that 
sanctuary  a  huge  pillar  plated  with  gold,  which  emitted  a 
hundred  rays,  spun  it  round  rapidly  with  great  energy,  so 
that  the  fire  generated  therefrom  set  the  temple  ablaze.  Seeing 
that  monument  in  flames,  the  leader  of  monkeys  having 
despatched  a  hundred  titans,  resembled  Indra  slaying  the 
demons  with  his  thunderbolt  and,  standing  in  space,  he  cried 
out  exultingly : — 

"  Thousands  of  leaders  of  monkeys,  resembling  myself, 
valiant  and  brave,  are  scouring  the  whole  earth  under  Sugriva's 
command.  Among  these,  some  are  as  strong  as  elephants, 
others  ten  times  as  strong,  some  have  the  energy  of  a  thousand 
elephants,  some  of  a  whole  herd  and  some  have  the  strength 
of  the  wind,  while  a  few  possess  a  strength  that  may  not  be 
measured.  Such  are  the  monkeys,  armed  with  teeth  and 
claws,  that  in  hundreds  and  thousands  and  millions,  will 
accompany  Sugriva  when  he  comes  to  exterminate  you  all. 
Then  neither  the  city  of  Lanka  nor  any  of  you  nor  Ravana 
himself  will  survive,  since  they  have  incurred  the  wrath  of  that 
hero  of  the  House  of  Ikshwaku."

CHAPTER    44 

The  Death  of  Jambumalin 

Under  the  order  of  the  King  of  the  Titans,  the  valiant  son  of 
Prahasta,  Jambumalin  of  large  teeth,  went  out  bearing  his 
bow.  Wearing  garlands  and  red  attire  with  a  crown  and 
brilliant  ear-rings,  that  invincible  warrior  of  immense  stature, 
rolling  his  eyes  ferociously  drew  his  great  bow,  furnished  with 
shining  arrows,  equal  to  Indra's,  with  a  noise  like  thunder. 
Then  the  entire  sky  and  the  four  quarters  at  once  re-echoed 
to  the  sound  of  the  stretching  of  that  bow. 

Beholding  him  advance  in  a  chariot  yoked  to  asses,  Hanuman, 
endowed  with  great  vigour,  emitted  cries  of  exultation. 
Thereat  the  highly  powerful  Jambumalin  riddled  him  with 
whetted  shafts,  piercing  the  face  of  that  leader  of  monkeys 
with  a  crescent-shaped  arrow,  his  head  with  one  furnished 
with  plumes  and  his  arms  with  ten  having  iron  tips.  Struck 
by  those  arrows,  his  coppery  countenance  shone  like  an  autumn 
cloud  lit  by  the  rays  of  the  sun  and  his  ruddy  face,  stained  with 
vermilion,  resembled  a  red  lotus  in  the  sky,  sprinkled  with 
drops  of  gold. 

Wounded  by  those  shafts,  that  mighty  monkey  was  enraged 
and  seeing  a  great  rock  of  vast  size  lying  near,  he  raised  it  up 
and  hurled  it  against  his  adversary  with  violence,  who  countered 
it  with  ten  of  his  shafts.  Perceiving  this  feat  brought  to 
nought,  Hanuman,  in  fury,  tore  up  a  mighty  Sala  tree  and 
began  to  whirl  it  in  the  air,  whereupon  the  highly  powerful 
Jambumalin,  seeing  that  great  monkey  spinning  the  Sala  tree, 
let  loose  innumerable  shafts,  severing  it  with  four  arrows  and 
piercing  the  arms  of  that  monkey  with  five  others,  his  belly 
with  a  further  dart,  thereafter  piercing  him  between  the  breasts 
with  ten  more. 

His  body,  covered  with  darts,  a  prey  to  violent  anger, 
Hanuman,  seizing  a  club,  spun  it  with  extreme  velocity,  allow- 
ing it  to  tall  on  the  huge  chest  of  his  adversary,  whereupon 
44* 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

neither  his  head,  arms,  thighs,  bow,  his  chariot,  his  steeds  nor 
arrows  could  be  distinguished,  and  that  mighty  car  warrior, 
Jambumalin,  dropped  to  the  earth,  like  an  oak  that  has  been 
felled,  his  limbs  and  ornaments  crushed. 

Then  Ravana,  hearing  that  Jambumalin  had  been  slain,  as 
also  the  powerful  Kinkaras,  was  overcome  with  wrath.  Roll- 
ing his  eyes  inflamed  with  fury,  that  Lord  of  the  Titans  in- 
stantly issued  a  command  that  the  sons  of  his  ministers,  who 
were  endowed  with  exceeding  valour  and  strength,  should  go 
forth  to  the  attack. 


chapter   45 

Hanuman  slays  the  Sons  of  Ravana's  Ministers 

Then  under  the  command  of  that  Indra  of  Titans,  the  sons 
of  his  ministers,  seven  in  number,  resembling  the  fire  in 
splendour,  set  out  from  the  palace.  Escorted  by  a  large  army, 
furnished  with  bows,  full  of  energy,  skilled  in  the  use  of  wea- 
pons, they,  the  flower  of  warriors,  were  each  burning  for 
victory.  Mounted  in  great  chariots  plated  with  gold,  sur- 
mounted by  banners,  yoked  to  horses,  they  created  a  noise 
resembling  thunder.  Of  unequalled  courage,  stretching  their 
bows  inlaid  with  refined  gold,  like  unto  flashes  of  lightning 
athwart  the  clouds,  those  warriors  sallied  forth. 

Their  mothers  nevertheless,  knowing  of  the  death  of  the 
Kinkaras,  were  overcome  with  anxiety  as  also  their  friends  and 
kinsfolk. 

And,  exhorting  one  another,  clad  in  golden  armour,  they 
rushed  on  Hanuman,  who  stood  erect  at  the  gate.  From 
their  thundering  cars,  they  loosed  innumerable  shafts  like 
clouds  in  the  rainy  season,  and,  covered  by  that  hail  of  missiles, 
Hanuman's  body  was  concealed,  as  the  King  of  the  Mountains 
is  obscured  by  rain. 

Then  that  monkey  evaded  those  arrows  and  their  swiftly 
moving  chariots  by  executing  countless  skilful  evolutions  in 
the  air  and  appeared  like  Indra  sporting  with  his  archers, 
442 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

the  clouds.  Sending  up  a  mighty  shout  which  struck  terror 
into  the  great  host,  that  valiant  monkey  leapt  on  the  titans. 
The  scourge  of  his  foes  struck  some  of  them  with  the  palm 
of  his  hands  and  others  with  his  feet ;  some  he  hit  with  his 
fists  and  some  he  tore  with  his  nails,  striking  them  down  with 
his  chest  and  thighs,  while  some  fell  to  the  ground  by  the 
force  of  his  cry.  Felled  to  the  earth,  those  warriors  lay  dying 
and  the  entire  army  fled  to  the  four  quarters,  filled  with  terror, 
Elephants  trumpeted  and  horses  fell  slain;  the  ground  was 
strewn  with  the  broken  fragments  of  chariots,  seats,  banners 
and  canopies ;  rivers  of  blood  could  be  seen  Bowing  on  the 
highways  and  Lanka  re-echoed  with  fearful  cries. 

Having  slaughtered  those  mighty  titans,  that  heroic  monkey, 
burning  with  courage,  desiring  to  measure  his  strength  against 
other  demons,  stationed  himself  at  the  gate  once  more. 


CHAPTER    46 

He  annihilates  five  Generals  and  their  Forces 

Learning  that  the  sons  of  his  ministers  had  fallen  under  the 
blows  of  that  great  monkey,  Ravana,  with  a  darkened  counten- 
ance, concealing  his  fears,  formed  a  resolution  which  he 
deemed  would  prove  decisive. 

Thereupon  Dashagriva  commanded  the  leaders  of  his 
forces,  Virupaksha,  Yupaksha,  Durdharsha,  Praghasa  and 
Basakarna,  masters  of  strategy,  endowed  with  the  speed  of 
the  wind,  brave  and  skilful  warriors,  to  take  Hanuman  captive, 
saying : — 

"  Ye  Generals,  who  are  full  of  valour,  set  out  at  the  head 
of  your  troops  with  your  fleet  of  horses,  chariots  and  elephants 
and  take  this  monkey  prisoner.  Approaching  that  dweller  of 
the  woods,  exercise  great  circumspection  and  act  with  due 
consideration  for  time  and  place.  Having  regard  to  his  con- 
duct, I  do  not  judge  him  to  be  a  monkey,  he  being  endowed 
with  extraordinary  prowess.  I  deem  him  to  be  a  higher 
being  and  not  a  monkey ;  perchance  he  is  an  emissary  created 
443 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

by  India  by  virtue  of  his  penances  in  order  to  destroy  us. 
Under  my  command,  ye  have  all  triumphed  over  Nagas, 
Yakshas,  Gandharvas,  Devas,  Asuras  and  great  Rishis ;  un- 
doubtedly they  are  plotting  some  treachery  against  us,  there- 
fore seize  this  being  by  force.  O  Generals,  let  each  go  forth 
at  the  head  of  a  mighty  host,  attended  by  horses,  chariots  and 
elephants  and  take  this  monkey  prisoner.  In  former  times  I 
have  seen  monkeys  endowed  with  immense  energy,  like  Bali, 
Sugriva,  the  exceedingly  powerful  Jambavan,  the  General 
Nila  and  others,  such  as  Dvivida,  yet  there  was  nothing  alarm- 
ing in  their  gait,  their  energy,  their  prowess,  their  intelligence, 
their  conduct  or  their  capacity  to  assume  different  forms, 
this,  however,  is  some  great  being  masquerading  as  a  monkey. 
Even  though  the  Three  Worlds  with  Indra,  the  Gods,  the 
titans  and  men  cannot  resist  you  on  the  field  of  battle,  great 
efforts  will  be  needed  to  lay  hold  of  him.  Nevertheless,  even 
a  seasoned  warrior,  desiring  to  triumph  in  combat,  is  not  able 
to  defend  his  life  without  exertion,  for  the  outcome  of  a  battle 
is  uncertain." 

Obedient  to  the  commands  of  their  lord,  all  those  valiant 
titans,  resplendent  as  fire,  attended  by  their  troops,  threw  them- 
selves in  all  haste  into  their  chariots  with  sharp  and  pointed 
weapons  and  on  to  their  swift  steeds  and  elephants  maddened 
with  ichor. 

Then  those  warriors  beheld  that  mighty  monkey,  shining 
like  the  sun  that  rises  with  its  diadem  of  sparkling  rays,  and 
seeing  him  stationed  at  the  gate,  possessed  of  immense  strength 
and  speed,  highly  intelligent  and  brave,  with  his  vast  stature 
and  huge  arms,  they  were  afraid  and  assailed  him  from  all 
sides  with  their  dreadful  weapons. 

Then  Durdharsha  discharged  five  white  iron,  and  yellow 
pointed  arrows  at  Hanuman's  forehead,  possessing  the  lustre  of 
lotus  petals,  and  his  head  being  pierced  with  those  shafts,  that 
monkey  leapt  into  the  air  making  the  ten  cardinal  points  ring 
with  his  cry,  whereupon  that  powerful  and  heroic  warrior 
Durdharsha,  standing  in  his  chariot  with  his  bow  stretched, 
advanced,  letting  fly  a  hundred  arrows  at  once.  Thereupon, 
Hanuman,  like  unto  the  wind  driving  away  clouds,  intercepted 
those  arrows  while  coursing  in  the  sky,  and  sore  beset  by 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Durdharsha,the  offspring  of  the  Wind  expanded  in  size,  emitting 
loud  roars,  and  thereafter,  with  a  great  bound  swooped  on  the 
chariot  of  Durdharsha  with  extreme  force,  like  a  succession  of 
lightning  flashes  striking  a  mountain.  Thrown  from  his  car, 
his  eight  steeds  mangled,  the  pole  and  the  shaft  broken,  that 
warrior  fell  to  the  earth,  slain. 

Then  Virupaksha  and  Yupaksha,  seeing  him  lying  on  the 
ground,  waxing  wrath  sprang  up  and  advanced  on  Hanuman 
dealing  blows  with  their  maces,  striking  the  chest  of  that 
long-armed  monkey  as  he  stood  in  space ;  whereupon  he 
meeting  the  shock  of  their  assault,  evaded  their  arrows  and, 
that  exceedingly  powerful  monkey,  the  son  of  Anila,  swooped 
down  on  the  earth  like  an  eagle ;  thereafter  seizing  and  up- 
rooting a  Sala  tree,  assailing  those  two  titans  with  blows,  that 
offspring  of  the  Wind-god  slew  those  two  mighty  and  heroic 
demons. 

Then  learning  that  those  three  titans  had  been  slain  by  the 
monkey,  endowed  with  great  swiftness,  the  courageous  Praghasa 
rushed  upon  him  laughing  scornfully  and  the  audacious 
Basakarna  enraged,  armed  with  a  spear,  also  advanced 
towards  him.  Then  each  from  his  side  attacked  that  Hon 
among  monkeys.  Praghasa  assailing  him  with  a  sharp-edged 
axe  and  Basakarna  with  his  spear  and,  with  his  body  streaming 
with  blood,  his  limbs  lacerated  by  their  blows,  that  monkey, 
highly  enraged  looked  like  the  rising  sun. 

Thereafter  that  heroic  monkey,  Hanuman,  breaking  off  the 
peak  of  a  mountain,  together  with  its  beasts,  snakes  and  trees, 
crushed  those  titans,  grinding  them  to  dust;  and  having  slain 
those  five  generals,  that  monkey  proceeded  to  destroy  the 
remaining  host.  As  the  Thousand-eyed  Deity  destroyed 
the  Asuras,  so  did  Hanuman,  the  horses  with  horses,  the 
elephants  with  elephants,  chariots  with  chariots,  and  warriors 
with  warriors  and  the  pathways  were  choked  with  elephants, 
shattered  chariots  and  the  bodies  of  the  titans.  Having 
destroyed  those  heroic  generals  with  their  forces  and  vehicles, 
that  hero,  resembling  Time,  pausing  at  the  destruction  of  the 
worlds,  rested  at  the  gate.

THE    RAMAVANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER    47 

The  Death  of  Aksha 

Hearing  that  those  five  generals  with  their  forces  and  vehicles 
had  been  struck  down  by  Hanuman,  the  King  of  the  Titans 
glanced  at  the  youthful  Aksha,  who  full  of  martial  ardour  sat 
before  him;  and  that  impetuous  warrior,  armed  with  a  bow 
inlaid  with  gold,  responding  to  his  glance,  leapt  up  like  a  flame 
that  blazes  forth  when  fed  with  clarified  butter  by  the  foremost 
of  sages  in  the  sacrificial  chamber. 

And  he  ascended  a  chariot,  acquired  at  the  price  of  accumu- 
lated sacrifice,  plated  with  refined  gold,  dressed  with  flags 
embroidered  with  pearls,  yoked  to  eight  steeds  swift  as  thought, 
unconquerable  by  Gods  or  titans,  surmounting  every  obstacle, 
flashing  like  lightning,  of  superb  workmanship,  able  to  travel 
through  space,  equipped  with  quivers,  arrows,  eight  swords, 
darts  and  lances  in  orderly  array,  bound  with  golden  ropes, 
shining  with  its  myriad  weapons,  bearing  golden  garlands, 
rivalling  the  radiance  of  the  sun  and  moon.  Filling  the 
firmament,  the  earth  and  its  mountains  with  the  sound  of 
horses,  elephants  and  great  chariots,  Aksha,  at  the  head  of  his 
forces,  advanced  on  that  monkey,  who  was  stationed  on  the  gate. 
Coming  before  that  monkey,  Aksha,  with  the  gaze  of  a  lion, 
in  which  admiration  and  respect  were  mingled,  measured 
Hanuman  with  his  glance,  who  resembled  the  fire  at  the  dis- 
solution of  the  worlds  intent  on  destroying  all  creatures. 
Thereafter  that  mighty  son  of  Ravana,  reflecting  on  the  exceed- 
ing valour  of  that  monkey,  his  prowess  in  regards  to  the  enemy 
and  on  his  own  strength,  swelled  up  with  pride  and  resembled 
the  sun  at  the  end  of  the  world  cycle.  Then  summoning  up 
his  courage,  enraged,  he  took  his  stand  resolutely  in  the  field, 
and  with  concentrated  mind  challenged  Hanuman,  irresistible 
in  combat  and  of  unimaginable  prowess,  directing  three 
whetted  shafts  upon  him. 

446 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Observing  that  audacious  monkey,  indifferent  to  fatigue, 
accustomed  to  overcoming  his  foes  and  proud,  Aksha  took 
up  his  bow,  holding  his  arrows  in  his  hand.  Wearing  a  corselet 
and  bracelets  of  gold,  with  marvellous  earrings,  endowed 
with  martial  ardour,  Aksha  rushed  on  that  monkey  and  a 
terrific  struggle  ensued  which  was  unparalleled  on  earth  and 
struck  terror  even  in  the  Gods  and  titans.  Witnessing  that 
mighty  conflict  between  the  monkey  and  the  youthful  titan, 
the  earth  cried  out,  the  sun  ceased  to  pour  down  its  warming 
rays,  the  wind  no  longer  blew  and  the  mountains  shook ; 
the  whole  firmament  was  filled  with  the  sound  and  the  ocean 
was  convulsed.  Then  that  hero,  skilled  in  directing  his  aim, 
fixed  his  shafts  and  loosing  them  pierced  that  monkey  in  the 
forehead  with  three  steel  pointed  winged  arrows  plated  with 
gold  and  resembling  venomous  snakes. 

Wounded  by  those  murderous  darts,  his  eyes  blinded  by  the 
blood  flowing  from  his  brow,  Hanuman  resembled  the  rising 
sun,  having  arrows  for  its  rays.  Beholding  that  offspring  of 
the  foremost  of  monarchs  with  his  splendid  weapons  upraised 
and  his  marvellous  bow,  that  valiant  counsellor  of  the  Lord 
of  the  Monkeys  rejoiced  and  in  his  ardour  put  forth  his  whole 
strength.  Resembling  the  sun  crowned  with  an  aureole  of 
rays  as  it  rises  over  the  peak  of  the  Mandara  Mountain,  Hanuman, 
inflamed  with  ire,  filled  with  strength  and  energy,  consumed  the 
youthful  Aksha  with  his  forces  and  vehicles  by  his  fiery  glances. 

Thereupon  that  titan,  from  his  bow  equal  unto  Indra's 
charged  with  innumerable  darts,  let  fall  a  mighty  shower  of 
arrows  on  the  foremost  of  monkeys  in  the  fight,  as  a  cloud 
looses  its  waters  on  a  lofty  mountain. 

Seeing  the  youthful  Aksha  on  the  field,  seething  with  wrath 
and  filled  with  valour,  energy  and  strength,  furnished  with 
arrows,  that  monkey  shouted  aloud  in  exultation  and,  as  an 
elephant  draws  near  to  a  pit  concealed  in  the  grass,  so  did 
Aksha,  in  the  inexperience  of  his  youth,  giving  rein  to  his 
fury,  proud  of  his  valour,  approach  that  incomparable  warrior 
in  conflict.  Hanuman  struck  by  those  shafts,  emitted  a  loud 
roar  resembling  a  thunder  cloud  and,  assuming  a  formidable 
aspect,  full  of  vigour,  agitating  his  legs  and  arms,  churned  up 
the  air.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Leaping  upwards,  that  valiant  titan,  raining  arrows,  hurled 
himself  upon  Hanuman  and  that  foremost  of  titans,  exceed- 
ingly skilled,  greatest  of  car-warriors,  Aksha,  burning  with 
courage,  covered  him  with  a  hail  of  shafts,  as  a  cloud  covers 
the  mountains  with  hailstones.  Evading  those  arrows  by 
darting  between  them,  that  heroic  monkey,  with  the  speed  of 
the  wind,  swift  as  thought,  began  to  range  the  path  of  the 
air.  Casting  glances  full  of  pride  on  Aksha,  who  was  armed 
with  bow  and  arrows,  burning  to  fight  and,  filling  the  sky 
with  his  countless  excellent  shafts,  that  offspring  of  the  Wind- 
god  became  thoughtful  and  his  breast,  pierced  by  the  shafts 
of  that  youthful  and  powerful  hero,  he  emitted  a  great  shout. 
Recognising  the  skill  of  Aksha,  he  pondered  on  the  warlike 
qualities  of  that  warrior,  reflecting : — 

"  This  great  and  powerful  warrior,  like  an  infant  sun  in 
splendour,  has  accomplished  deeds  incapable  of  being  per- 
formed by  a  boy ;  I  am  loath  to  slay  one  who  has  shown 
himself  equal  to  every  martial  feat ;  he  is  high-souled,  filled 
with  valour,  concentrated  and  able  to  endure  extreme  hardship 
in  war,  worthy  of  being  honoured  by  the  great  Sages,  Nagas 
and  Yakshas ;  his  strength  and  courage  lend  him  a  noble 
assurance  and  standing  before  me,  he  looks  me  straight  in 
the  eyes.  Forsooth  the  heroism  of  this  audacious  being 
would  shake  the  soul  of  the  Gods  and  titans  themselves.  Verily 
he  is  an  adversary  not  to  be  despised,  his  prowess  increases 
as  he  fights  ;  if  I  disregard  him,  he  will  defeat  me,  therefore  I 
must  destroy  him  for  a  spreading  fire  may  not  be  neglected." 

Reflecting  thus  on  the  strength  of  his  foe  and  his  own,  that 
powerful  one,  endowed  with  energy,  resolved  to  slay  his 
adversary.  Thereafter  that  valiant  monkey,  born  of  Pavana, 
coursing  through  the  air,  struck  those  eight  excellent  steeds  of 
immense  size  capable  of  bearing  a  heavy  burden  in  combat  with 
the  palm  of  his  hand  and,  that  great  chariot,  overturned  by 
the  blow  administered  by  the  counsellor  of  the  King  of  the 
Monkeys,  its  pole  shattered,  the  shafts  riven,  the  steeds  slain, 
fell  to  the  earth  from  the  sky. 

Thereupon,  abandoning  his  car,  bearing  his  bow  and  sword, 
that  warrior  leapt  into  the  air,  as  an  ascetic  consequent  on  his 
penances  ascends  to  heaven  on  leaving  the  body. 
448 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Rising  into  the  sky  frequented  by  the  King  of  the  Birds, 
the  wind  and  the  Celestials,  that  monkey,  with  a  single  bound, 
seizing  hold  of  his  legs,  as  Garuda  catches  hold  of  a  snake, 
with  a  strength  equal  to  his  sire's,  spun  him  round  and  round 
and  threw  him  violently  on  the  earth.  With  his  arms,  thighs 
and  chest  crushed,  vomiting  blood,  his  bones  and  eyes  pulverised, 
his  joints  dislocated,  his  sinews  torn,  he  fell  to  earth  slain  by 
the  Son  of  the  Wind. 

Thereupon  that  mighty  monkey  trod  his  rival  underfoot, 
striking  terror  into  the  heart  of  the  King  of  the  Titans,  and 
all  the  Rishis,  Cakracaras,  Bhutas,  Yakshas,  Pannagas  and 
Suras  assembled  with  their  leader  Indra,  who  gazed  with 
wonder  on  the  simian  slayer  of  that  youthful  titan.  And 
Hanuman,  having  destroyed  the  stripling  Aksha,  whose  eyes 
were  inflamed  with  blood  on  the  field  of  battle,  returned  to 
the  gate  once  more  and  waited  there  like  Death  at  the  time  of 
the  destruction  of  all  creatures. 


CHAPTER    48 

Hanuman  allows  himself  to  be  taken  captive  by  the  Titans 

The  youthful  Aksha  having  been  slain  by  Hanuman,  Ravana, 
controlling  his  agitation,  filled  with  anger,  commanded  Indrajita, 
who  resembled  a  god,  to  take  the  field,  saying : — 

"  Thou  art  the  foremost  of  those  bearing  arms  and  hast 
afflicted  even  the  Gods  and  Asuras  in  war ;  thou  art  renowned 
among  warriors  and  hast  acquired  divine  weapons  by  the  grace 
of  Brahma ;  thou  art  invincible  in  combat,  even  against  the 
Maruts  led  by  Indra  himself.  There  is  none  in  the  Three 
Worlds  who  does  not  tire  in  battle,  save  thou.  Thou  art 
preserved  by  thy  prowess  in  arms  and  thy  valour  is  thy  shield ; 
being  versed  in  the  knowledge  of  time  and  place,  thou  art 
exceedingly  experienced  and  no  feat  is  impossible  for  thee  to 
accomplish  in  the  field,  who  art  full  of  forethought ;  there  is 
none  in  the  Three  Worlds  but  is  conversant  with  thine  austeri- 
ties equal  to  mine  own,  as  also  thy  prowess  and  the  strength 
449 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  thine  arms  in  combat,  nay,  depending  on  thee,  I  have  no 
anxiety  regarding  the  outcome  of  the  fray. 

"  In  truth  I  did  not  put  the  same  reliance  on  those  who 
have  succombed  that  I  now  place  in  thee,  O  Destroyer  of  Thy 
Foes,  neither  in  the  Kinkaras  nor  in  Jambumalin,  the  son  of 
my  counsellor  nor  in  the  five  generals  going  forth  at  the  head 
of  their  troops  with  innumerable  forces,  accompanied  by 
horses,  elephants  and  chariots  nor  in  the  youthful,  dearly 
beloved,  Aksha,  slain  by  that  monkey.  O  Hero,  thou  sur- 
passest  them  all,  therefore,  reflecting  on  thine  own  strength, 
with  all  haste  act  in  such  a  manner  that  the  destruction  of  the 
army  may  be  avoided.  O  Foremost  of  those  bearing  arms, 
considering  thine  own  prowess  and  that  of  thine  adversary, 
who  now  reposes  quietly  after  creating  carnage  among  these 
hostile  hosts,  act  so  that  his  might  may  be  subdued.  Powerful 
forces  can  serve  no  purpose  here,  for  great  armies  flee  before 
Hanuman  nor  do  maces  avail ;  the  speed  of  Maruti  is  irre- 
sistible and,  like  unto  Agni,  he  may  not  be  slain  by  weapons. 
Therefore,  revolving  all  these  things  in  thy  mind  and  reflecting 
on  the  divine  quality  of  thy  bow,  with  the  intention  of  bring- 
ing about  a  successful  issue,  strive  with  determination  to 
overcome  thy  foe  by  frustrating  his  attacks.  Assuredly  it 
was  not  my  will  to  expose  thee  to  this  hazard,  O  Foremost 
among  those  endowed  with  intelligence,  yet  this  course  of 
action  is  approved  by  warriors  and  is  in  accord  with  the  duty  of 
kings.  In  war  one  must  be  versed  in  the  traditions  as  also 
in  the  rules  of  military  science  in  order  to  emerge  triumphant 
from  the  struggle." 

Hearing  the  words  of  his  sire,  Indrajita,  whose  prowess  was 
equal  to  that  of  the  son  of  Daksha,  circumambulated  him  and 
inspired  with  martial  ardour,  prepared  to  fight.  Overwhelmed 
with  homage  by  his  cherished  companions,  who  had  assembled 
there,  he  set  out  for  battle.  And  the  resplendent  son  of  the 
King  of  the  Titans,  whose  eyes  resembled  the  petals  of  a  lotus, 
bounded  impetuously  forward,  like  the  ocean  at  the  time  of 
the  full  moon.  Thereafter,  Indrajita  of  matchless  prowess, 
equal  unto  Indra,  ascended  his  chariot,  swift  as  the  eagle  or 
the  wind,  moving  freely,  drawn  by  four  lions  with  pure  white 
teeth.

SUNDARA    KANDA 

Standing  in  his  chariot,  that  most  skilled  of  archers,  fully 
conversant  with  the  use  of  weapons,  the  foremost  of  warriors 
drove  rapidly  to  where  Hanuman  was  to  be  found. 

Hearing  the  rumbling  of  wheels  and  the  twanging  of  the 
bowstring,  the  delight  of  that  monkey  was  redoubled,  where- 
upon Indrajita,  seizing  his  bow  and  steel-pointed  arrows, 
versed  in  the  art  of  warfare,  proceeded  towards  Hanuman 
and  as  he  advanced  light-heartedly,  his  weapons  in  his  hand, 
the  four  quarters  grew  dark  and  jackals  set  up  a  hideous 
howling.  Nagas,  Yakshas,  Maharishis,  Cakracaras  and  Siddhas 
assembled  and  the  sky  was  filled  with  birds  emitting  piercing 
cries. 

Seeing  that  chariot  bearing  down  on  him,  the  standard  of 
Indra  unfurled,  that  monkey  raised  a  great  shout  and  expanded 
his  body ;  whereupon,  Indrajita  in  his  celestial  car,  drew  back 
his  marvellous  bow,  emitting  a  sound  like  thunder  and  those 
two  powerful  heroes  closed  in  conflict,  the  monkey  and  the 
son  of  the  King  of  the  Titans,  like  unto  God  and  demon. 

Indifferent  to  danger  they  began  to  fight  and  that  mighty 
monkey  evaded  the  impetuous  army  of  that  valiant  archer  and 
consummate  warrior  in  his  great  car,  by  executing  a  myriad 
evolutions  in  the  air  with  indescribable  agility.  Thereupon, 
the  heroic  Indrajita,  slayer  of  his  foes,  began  to  discharge  his 
marvellous  superbly-fashioned  sharp  steel-pointed  and  winged 
arrows,  tipped  with  gold,  swift  as  lightning.  Hearing  the 
rumbling  of  that  chariot,  the  rolling  of  the  drums  together  with 
the  sound  of  the  stretching  of  the  bow,  Hanuman  leapt  hither 
and  thither  and  that  mighty  monkey,  evading  the  rain  of  arrows, 
skilfully  eluded  that  dexterious  bowman,  whose  target  he  was, 
and  stretching  out  his  arms,  Hanuman,  the  son  of  Anila, 
turning  aside  from  those  missiles,  leapt  into  the  sky.  Thus 
those  skilful  and  spirited  warriors,  exceedingly  swift  in  motion 
and  versed  in  the  art  of  warfare,  engaged  in  combat  to  the 
wonder  of  all  beings.  Nor  was  the  titan  able  to  take  Hanuman 
unawares  nor  Maruti  surprise  Indrajita,  as  they  hurled  them- 
selves on  one  another  with  a  courage  worthy  of  the  Gods. 

Observing  him  unscathed  although  the  target  of  his  infallible 
arrows,  Indrajita,  controlling  his  senses,  engaged  in  profound 
concentration  of  thought  on    Hanuman,    and    finding   him 

451  2G 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

incapable  of  being  slain,  he  began  to  consider  how  he  could  be 
bound  fast  and  that  most  experienced  of  warriors,  full  of 
exceeding  energy,  discharged  that  powerful  weapon  conferred 
on  him  by  Brahma  on  that  illustrious  monkey.  Knowing  him 
to  be  incapable  of  being  slain,  Indrajita,  skilled  in  strategy, 
bound  that  offspring  of  the  Wind-god  with  the  aid  of  that 
weapon. 

Struck  by  the  titan  with  the  Brahma-weapon,  that  monkey 
fell  to  the  earth  unconscious,  but  knowing  himself  to  be  bound 
by  a  shaft  belonging  to  the  Lord,  he  did  not  experience  the  least 
pain  and  though  bereft  of  strength,  that  monkey  bethought 
himself  of  Brahma's  blessing.  Then  that  heroic  monkey 
began  to  recollect  the  boons  conferred  on  him  by  Brahma 
and  thinking  of  that  weapon  bestowed  by  the  Self-create, 
consecrated  by  mantras,  he  reflected :  "  I  may  not  release 
myself  from  these  bonds  in  virtue  of  the  power  of  that  Guru 
of  the  World.  Further,  this  subjugation  has  been  ordained 
by  Him  and  must  be  endured  by  me." 

Thereupon,  reflecting  on  the  power  of  that  weapon  and  the 
compassion  of  the  Grandsire  of  the  World  towards  him,  also 
of  the  possibility  of  deliverance,  that  monkey  submitted  himself 
to  Brahma's  decree. 

He  thought:  "Though  made  fast  by  this  weapon,  I  experi- 
ence no  fear ;  the  Grandsire  of  the  World,  Mahendra  and 
Anila  will  protect  me ;  in  sooth  I  deem  it  to  be  to  mine  advantage 
to  fall  into  the  hands  of  the  titans  and  thus  come  face  to  face 
with  their  great  king,  therefore  let  mine  enemies  take  me 
captive ! " 

Having  thus  resolved,  that  destroyer  of  his  foes,  full  of 
circumspection,  lay  motionless  and  being  ruthlessly  pinioned 
by  the  titans,  he  responded  to  their  threats  and  abuses  by 
leonine  roars.  Beholding  that  subduer  of  his  foes  lying 
motionless,  the  titans  bound  him  with  plaited  ropes  of  hemp 
and  bark  and  he  willingly  allowed  himself  to  be  tied  and  in- 
sulted by  his  foes  in  order  that  he  might  converse  with  the 
King  of  the  Titans,  should  he,  out  of  curiosity,  desire  to  see 
him.  Bound  with  ropes,  the  monkey  was  no  longer  under 
the  sway  of  the  Brahma-weapon,  for,  he  being  secured  by 
other  bonds,  it  was  rendered  void.  Beholding  that  excellent 
452 


SUNDARA    KANDA 
monkey  bound  with  bark,  the  valiant  Indrajita  recognised  him 
to  be  freed  from  that  supernatural  weapon  and  became  pensive, 
saying  aloud : — 

"Alas,  those  titans  have  rendered  my  exploit  useless,  not 
being  conversant  with  the  power  of  mantras  and  that  Brahma- 
weapon  being  rendered  void,  no  other  is  effective,  thus  we  are 
all  placed  in  a  great  predicament  for  this  weapon  may  not  be 
loosed  twice." 

Though  delivered  from  the  power  of  that  weapon,  Hanuman 
betrayed  it  by  no  sign,  despite  the  suffering  caused  by  the 
fetters  that  bound  him  and  he  allowed  himself  to  be  ill-treated 
by  the  titans  and  assaulted  by  those  cruel  demons  who  struck 
him  with  their  fists  and  dragged  him  before  Ravana.  Freed 
from  the  Brahma-weapon,  yet  bound  by  hempen  ropes,  that 
powerful  and  heroic  monkey  was  paraded  by  Indrajita  before 
Ravana  and  his  court.  And  those  titans  related  to  the  king 
everything  concerning  that  foremost  of  monkeys,  who  re- 
sembled a  maddened  elephant  that  has  been  bound. 

On  seeing  the  foremost  of  monkeys  made  captive,  those  war- 
like titans  enquired  saying: — "Who  is  this?  Who  has  sent 
him  ?  From  whence  has  he  come  ?  What  is  his  mission  ? 
Who  are  his  supporters  ? "  and  others  exclaimed  angrily : 
"  Kill  him  !   Burn  him  !   Devour  him ! " 

Having  come  some  way,  Hanuman  observed  elderly  attend- 
ants seated  at  the  feet  of  their  sovereign  and  he  gazed  with 
admiration  on  the  palace  decorated  with  gems. 

Then  the  exceedingly  powerful  Ravana  beheld  that  foremost 
of  monkeys  dragged  hither  and  thither  by  those  hideous  titans, 
and  Hanuman  gazed  at  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  who  was  like 
unto  a  blazing  sun  in  his  might  and  glory. 

Seeing  Hanuman,  that  Ten-headed  One  issued  orders  to  his 
chief  ministers,  distinguished  for  their  lineage  and  character, 
who  stood  before  him  and  commanded  them  to  interrogate 
that  monkey.  Thereupon,  questioned  in  turn  by  them 
concerning  the  purpose  of  his  coming,  Hanuman  answered : — 
"  I  am  a  messenger,  I  come  from  King  Sugriva."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    49 

His  Astonishment  on  beholding  Ravana 

Pondering  on  the  exploits  of  that  one  of  exceeding  prowess, 
Hanuman  gazed  with  wonder  on  the  King  of  the  Titans, 
whose  eyes  were  red  with  anger  and  who  was  blazing  with 
rare  and  dazzling  gold,  adorned  with  a  splendid  diadem  studded 
with  pearls  and  excellent  ornaments  of  diamonds  and  precious 
stones  created  by  the  power  of  concentrated  thought.  Attired 
in  costly  linen,  daubed  with  red  sandalpaste  painted  with 
variegated  devices,  he  looked  splendid  with  his  reddened  eyes, 
fierce  gaze,  brilliant  sharp  teeth  and  protruding  lips. 

To  that  monkey,  that  Ten-Headed  One,  who  was  resplendent 
and  of  great  energy,  resembled  the  Mandara  Mountain  with  its 
summits  infested  with  innumerable  snakes  or  a  mass  of  blue 
antimony.  A  string  of  pearls  gleaming  on  his  breast,  his 
countenance  possessing  the  lustre  of  the  full  moon,  he  resembled 
a  cloud  illumined  by  the  rising  sun.  With  his  great  arms 
laden  with  bracelets,  smeared  with  sandal  paste,  his  fingers, 
like  five-headed  serpents  covered  with  sparkling  rings,  he  was 
seated  on  a  superb  and  marvellously  inlaid  crystal  throne 
studded  with  gems  and  covered  with  rich  hangings.  Women, 
sumptuously  attired,  surrounded  him,  chowries  in  their  hands 
and  he  was  attended  by  four  experienced  counsellors,  Durdhara, 
Prahasta,  Mahaparshwa  and  the  minister  Nikumbha  who  stood 
round  him  like  the  four  seas  surrounding  the  earth ;  and 
other  counsellors  too  waited  upon  him  as  do  the  Gods  on 
their  King. 

Then  Hanuman  gazed  on  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  clothed  in 
extreme  splendour,  resembling  the  peak  of  Mount  Mem 
surrounded  by  thunder  clouds  and,  though  suffering  at  the 
hands  of  those  titans  of  dreadful  prowess,  Hanuman  experienced 
extreme  astonishment  at  the  sight  of  that  monarch  and  be- 
holding the  effulgence  of  that  Lord  of  the  Titans,  dazzled  by 
his  magnificence,  he  became  absorbed  in  thought. 
454 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

'  What  splendour,  what  power,  what  glory,  what  majesty, 
he  reflected,  '  nothing  is  lacking !  Were  he  not  evil,  this 
mighty  monarch  of  the  titans  could  be  the  protector  of  the 
celestial  realm  and  Indra  himself,  but  his  cruel  and  ruthless 
deeds,  abhorrent  to  all,  render  him  the  scourge  of  the  worlds 
as  also  of  the  Gods  and  demons ;  in  bis  anger  he  could  make 
an  ocean  of  the  earth  !  * 

Such  were  the  diverse  thoughts  of  that  sagacious  monkey 
on  beholding  the  immeasurable  power  and  might  of  the  King 
of  the  Titans. 


CHAPTER     50 

Hanuman  is  questioned  by  the  Titans 

Beholding  that  tawny-eyed  one  standing  before  him,  the 
mighty-armed  Ravana,  the  terror  of  the  worlds,  was  seized 
with  violent  rage.  Gazing  on  that  lion  among  monkeys 
radiating  splendour,  his  mind  filled  with  apprehension,  he 
reflected : — 

"  Is  this  the  blessed  Nandi,  who  has  come  hither,  he  who 
formerly  cursed  me  when,  on  Mount  Kailasha,  he  became  the 
object  of  my  mockery  ?  Or  is  he  perchance  Vana  Bali's  son 
in  the  form  of  a  monkey." 

His  eyes  red  with  anger,  the  king  then  addressed  the  fore- 
most of  bis  counsellors,  Prahasta,  in  words  that  were  opportune 
and  fraught  with  good  sense,  saying : — 

"  Demand  of  this  perverse  wretch,  whence  he  has  come,  for 
what  reason  he  laid  waste  the  grove  and  why  he  slew  the 
titans  ?  What  is  his  purpose  in  entering  this  impregnable 
citadel  and  why  did  he  attack  my  retainers  ?  Interrogate  this 
scoundrel  concerning  these  matters  !  " 

At  these  words  of  Ravana,  Prahasta  said  to  Hanuman : — 
"  O  Monkey,  be  of  good  courage,  thou  hast  nought  to  fear ! 
If  it  be  Indra  who  has  sent  thee  to  Ravana's  abode,  tells  us 
frankly  !  Have  no  anxiety,  thou  shalt  be  liberated  !  If  thou 
art  from  Vaishxavana,  Yama  or  Varuna  and  have  penetrated 
into  our  city  disguising  thy  real  form  or  if  thou  hast  been 
455 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

dispatched  by  Vishnu,  hungry  for  conquest,  then  tell  us. 
Thy  form  alone  is  that  of  a  monkey,  not  thy  prowess.  Unfold 
all  this  unto  us  faithfully,  O  Monkey  and  thou  shalt  instantly 
regain  thy  freedom  but  if  thou  liest,  thou  shalt  pay  for  it  with 
thy  life !  Therefore  tell  us  why  thou  hast  entered  Havana's 
abode." 

Thus  addressed,  the  foremost  of  monkeys  answered  the  Lord 
of  the  Titans,  saying : — 

"  I  am  not  from  Shakra  nor  Yama  nor  Varuna  nor  am  I 
allied  to  Kuvera  nor  am  I  sent  by  Vishnu.  I  am  truly  a 
monkey  as  I  appear  to  be,  who  have  come  here  in  order  to 
behold  the  King  of  the  Titans  and  for  this  purpose  I  destroyed 
the  grove.  To  preserve  my  life  I  fought  with  the  titans  who, 
full  of  valour,  presented  themselves  before  me.  Neither 
weapons  nor  chains  can  subdue  me,  even  those  of  the  Gods 
and  titans  themselves,  I  having  received  this  boon  from  the 
Grandsire  of  the  World.  It  was  because  I  desired  to  see  the 
king  that  I  suffered  myself  to  be  overcome  by  the  Brahma- 
weapon.  Though  I  was  not  under  the  spell  of  that  weapon, 
yet  I  permitted  the  titans  to  capture  me  in  order  to  further 
Rama's  design  for  which  purpose  I  have  entered  the  king's 
presence.  Knowing  me  to  be  the  messenger  of  Raghava, 
whose  power  is  limitless,  listen  to  my  words,  which  will  prove 
to  thine  advantage,  O  Lord." 


CHAPTER    5  I 

His  Words 

Seeing  the  mighty  ten-headed  Ravana,  that  intrepid  monkey 
addressed  him  fearlessly,  in  words  fraught  with  penetration, 
saying : — 

"  I  have  come  here  at  the  command  of  Sugriva,  O  Lord  of 
the  Titans !  As  a  brother,  that  Sovereign  of  the  Monkeys 
offers  salutations  to  thee.  Hear  the  counsel  of  a  brother,  the 
magnanimous  Sugriva  j  his  words  are  in  accord  with  justice, 
advantageous  and  salutary  both  in  this  world  and  hereafter. 

King  Dasaratha,  the  master  of  chariots,  elephants  and 
horses,  in  splendour  equal  to  Indra,  was  the  friend  of  all  and 
456 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

like  unto  a  father  to  his  subjects.  His  eldest  son,  mighty-armed, 
the  darling  of  his  sire,  at  his  command,  entered  the  Dandaka 
Forest  with  his  brother  Lakshmana  and  his  consort  Sita.  His 
name  is  Rama  and  he  is  exceedingly  valiant  and  ever  abides 
in  the  path  of  virtue.  His  faithful  consort,  Sita,  the  illustrious 
daughter  of  the  high-souled  Janaka,  King  of  Videha,  vanished 
in  the  forest  of  Janasthana.  Seeking  for  that  princess,  the 
king's  son  with  his  younger  brother  came  to  Rishyamuka 
and  met  with  Sugriva.  That  King  of  the  Monkeys  promised 
to  undertake  the  search  for  Sita  and  Rama  agreed  to  aid  him 
in  recovering  the  monkey  kingdom.  Thereupon,  slaying  Bali 
in  combat,  that  king's  son  established  Sugriva  on  the  throne, 
as  lord  of  all  the  bears  and  monkeys.  Bali,  that  bull  among 
monkeys,  formerly  known  to  thee,  was  slain  by  Rama  with 
a  single  arrow  in  the  fight,  whereupon  the  Lord  of  the  Monkeys, 
Sugriva,  true  to  his  vow,  eager  to  rind  Sita,  dispatched  monkeys 
in  all  directions.  Hundreds,  thousands  and  millions  of  monkeys 
are  exploring  every  region  high  and  low,  even  up  to  the  heavens 
and  some  resemble  Vainataya  and  some  the  wind  and  those 
highly  energetic  monkeys  course  hither  and  thither  without 
rest,  incapable  of  being  stayed.  I  am  named  Hanuman,  the 
beloved  son  of  Maruta  and,  in  order  to  find  Sita,  I  have  crossed 
four  hundred  miles  of  sea.  Having  passed  over  the  ocean, 
wandering  through  thy  palace,  1  observed  Janaka's  daughter. 

"  It  does  not  become  thee,  who  art  conversant  with  what  is 
meet  and  proper  and  hast  enriched  thyself  by  thy  penances, 
to  bear  away  another's  wife,  O  Eminently  Sagacious  One. 
Intelligent  beings,  such  as  thou,  should  not  commit  acts 
prohibited  by  the  law  of  righteousness  which  lead  to  ruin ! 
Who,  even  among  the  Gods  and  titans,  can  withstand  the  shafts 
loosed  by  Lakshmana  or  those  of  Raghava  in  his  wrath  ?  Nay, 
in  the  Three  Worlds,  there  is  none  who  may  affront  Rama 
with  impunity.  Following  the  path  of  duty  and  profit,  do  thou 
ponder  these  words  fraught  with  advantage  to  thee  in  the 
three  divisions  of  time  and  restore  Janaki  to  Rama,  that  lion 
among  men  ! 

"  I  have  seen  Sita  and  achieved  that  which  was  difficult  to 
compass,  as  for  what  remaineth  to  be  done,  Rama  himself  shall 
accomplish  it.  I  have  beheld  her  in  thine  abode,  suffering 
457 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

grievously ;  thou  art  seemingly  unaware  that  thou  harbourest 
a  five-headed  serpent  in  thy  mansion.  Even  as  food  mixed 
with  poison  may  not  be  digested  even  by  Gods  or  titans,  so 
is  she.  It  is  not  worthy  of  thee  to  bring  to  nought  that  merit 
acquired  by  extreme  mortification,  as  also  a  long  and  prosperous 
life.  Thou  deemest  thyself  by  thy  penances,  to  have  won 
immunity  from  death  even  from  Gods,  Immortals  or  titans, 
but  Sugriva  is  neither  a  God  nor  an  Immortal  nor  a  titan. 
Raghava,  O  King,  is  a  mortal  and  Sugriva,  the  Lord  of  Monkeys, 
therefore  how  wilt  thou  preserve  thy  life  ?  The  fruits  of  virtue 
do  not  blend  with  those  of  vice  nor  does  equity  destroy  iniquity, 
Till  to-day  thou  hast  plucked  the  fruit  of  thy  merits  but  soon 
thou  wilt  reap  the  fruit  of  thine  evil  deeds.  Having  learnt  of 
the  destruction  of  Janasthana,  the  death  of  Bali  and  the 
alliance  of  Rama  and  Sugriva ;  ponder  on  these  things  to 
thine  own  advantage.  I  am  undoubtedly  able  to  destroy 
Lanka  with  its  horses,  chariots  and  elephants  single-handed 
yet  I  have  not  received  the  mandate  to  do  so.  In  the  presence 
of  the  troops  of  monkeys  and  bears,  Rama  vowed  to  slay  his 
foes,  those  who  bore  Sita  away.  Assuredly,  in  doing  injury 
to  Rama,  even  Indra  himself  could  not  dwell  in  peace,  how 
much  less  one  like  thee.  This  Sita,  who  is  known  to  thee 
and  who  stays  in  thine  abode  is  the  night  of  death  that  will 
bring  about  thine  end  and  that  of  Lanka.  Beware  of  placing 
thy  neck  in  the  noose  of  death  in  the  form  of  Sita.  Consider 
how  thou  mayest  save  thyself.  Thou  shall  behold  this  mar- 
vellous city  with  its  palaces  and  highways  consumed  by  Ska's 
power  and  the  flames  fed  by  Rama's  wrath.  Do  not  therefore 
abandon  friends,  ministers,  kinsfolk,  brothers,  sons,  servants, 
wives  and  Lanka  to  this  fate.  O  Indra  among  Titans,  follow 
this  good  counsel  since  it  is  offered  to  thee  by  one  who  is  a 
monkey,  the  servant  and  messenger  of  Rama. 

"  Having  wholly  annihilated  the  worlds  and  their  inhabitants 
with  all  that  moves  or  does  not  move,  the  illustrious  Raghava 
could  re-create  them  all.  Among  the  chiefs  of  the  Gods, 
Titans,  Yakshas,  Danavas,  Nagas,  Vidyadharas,  Gandharvas, 
wild  beasts,  Siddhas  Kinneras  or  birds,  in  no  way  nor  any- 
where, at  no  time,  among  any  beings,  has  any  been  found, 
who  could  stand  against  Rama  whose  valour  is  equal  to  Vishnu's.

SUNDARA    KANDA 
Since  thou  hast  offered  that  lion  among  kings,  Rama,  this 
affront,  thy  life  is  forfeit ! 

"  Devas,  Daityas,  Gandharvas,  Vidyadharas,  Nagas  and 
Yakshas  are  all  unable  to  hold  their  own  in  combat  with  Rama, 
the  Protector  of  the  Three  Worlds,  O  King  of  the  Titans ! 
Even  were  it  the  Four-headed  Brahma,  Swyambhu  Himself 
or  the  Three-eyed  Rudra,  the  destroyer  of  Tripura,  or  the 
mighty  Indra,  Chief  of  the  Gods,  not  one  of  them  could  with- 
stand Raghava  in  the  field.'* 

Hearing  this  distasteful  yet  excellent  speech  of  that  bold 
and  fearless  monkey,  the  Ten-Necked  One,  his  eyes  rolling  in 
anger,  ordered  him  to  be  put  to  death. 


chapter    52 

Bibtshana  pleads  for  Hanuman 

Hearing  the  words  of  that  high-souled  monkey,  Ravana,  in  a 
transport  of  fury,  ordered  him  to  be  put  to  death.  This  decree 
however,  issued  by  the  King  of  the  Titans  in  his  perversity 
on  one  who  had  proclaimed  himself  to  be  a  messenger,  did  not 
meet  with  the  approval  of  Bibishana. 

Knowing  that  Lord  of  the  Titans  to  be  exceeding  wrath 
and  the  affair  about  to  be  concluded,  that  prince,  firm  in 
justice,  began  to  consider  what  should  now  be  done  and  that 
subduer  of  his  foes,  having  resolved  how  to  act,  addressed  his 
elder  brother  in  words  which  were  essentially  true  and  mild, 
saying : — 

"  O  King  of  the  Titans,  control  thine  anger  and  with  a 
tranquil  mind  hear  me,  extend  thy  favour  to  me.  Righteous 
monarchs,  being  conversant  with  the  laws  of  cause  and  effect, 
do  not  take  the  life  of  a  messenger.  O  Valiant  Prince,  it  is 
contrary  to  justice,  opposed  to  social  usage,  and  unworthy  of  thee 
to  bring  about  the  death  of  this  monkey.  Thou  art  versed  in 
the  moral  code,  dost  recognise  an  obligation,  canst  distinguish 
between  high  and  low,  dost  carry  out  thy  kingly  duties  and  art 
aware  of  the  ultimate  purpose  of  life.  If  the  wise,  such  as 
459 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

thou,  suffer  themselves  to  be  mastered  by  anger,  then  the 
study  of  the  scriptures  is  only  a  weariness  of  the  flesh.  Be 
pacified  therefore,  O  Slayer  of  thine  Enemies,  O  Unconquerable 
Sovereign  of  the  Titans  and  consider  what  is  meet  and  just 
in  dealing  out  punishment  to  a  foe." 

Hearing  Bibishana's  words,  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans, 
in  a  violent  rage,  answered  him  saying : — 

"  O  Scourge  of  Thy  Foes,  to  slay  an  evil-doer  is  no  sin, 
therefore  I  shall  make  an  end  of  this  worker  of  iniquity." 

Hearing  this  infamous  and  unscrupulous  speech,  essentially 
perverse,  Bibishana,  who  was  the  foremost  of  those  endowed 
with  wisdom,  answered  in  words  fraught  with  integrity, 
saying : — 

"  O  Lord  of  Lanka,  King  of  all  the  Titans,  be  gracious  unto 
me  and  listen  to  that  which  embodies  the  significance  of  virtue 
and  profit.  Under  no  conditions  is  an  envoy  put  to  death, 
this  is  the  unanimous  verdict  of  the  good.  Undoubtedly  this 
is  a  formidable  adversary  and  he  has  inflicted  immeasurable 
injury  on  us,  yet  men  of  honour  do  not  sanction  the  slaying  of 
a  messenger  though  innumerable  punishments  have  been 
ordained  for  them.  Mutilation  of  the  body,  the  whip,  stripes, 
shaving  of  the  head,  branding,  one  or  all  of  these  may  be 
inflicted  on  a  messenger  but  of  punishment  by  death,  none 
has  ever  heard.  How  can  a  hero  such  as  thou  art,  whose 
mind  is  swayed  by  a  sense  of  duty  and  who  is  discriminating 
and  conversant  with  what  is  noble  and  ignoble,  suffer  himself 
to  be  overcome  by  anger  ?  The  virtuous  do  not  give  way  to 
wrath !  Thou  hast  no  equal  among  those  who  rule  over  a 
people  and  thou  art  able  to  comprehend  the  import  of  the 
scriptures ;  thou  surpasseth  the  titans  and  the  Gods.  In- 
vincible to  the  Gods  and  titans  who  are  endowed  with  prowess, 
martial  ardour  and  intelligence,  thou  hast  oft-times  in  battle 
routed  the  King  of  the  Celestials  and  other  monarchs.  Fools 
who,  even  in  thought  seek  to  injure  thee,  who  art  a  great  and 
intrepid  warrior,  who  hast  fought  with  Daityas  and  Dcvas, 
heroic,  intrepid  and  unconquerable,  are  already  deprived  of 
their  lives.  I  see  no  justification  for  putting  this  monkey  to 
death.  It  is  on  those  who  sent  him,  that  the  punishment 
should  fall.  Whether  he  be  honest  or  not,  the  responsibility 
460 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

rests  with  them.  Advocating  another's  interests  and  dependent 
on  them,  an  envoy  does  not  merit  death.  Further  if  this  one 
be  killed,  no  other  sky-ranger  may  present  himself  to  us, 
therefore,  O  Conqueror  of  Hostile  Citadels,  do  not  seek  to 
take  his  life ;  direct  thine  efforts  against  the  Gods  and  their 
leader.  O  Thou  who  lovest  warfare,  if  he  be  slain,  I  see  none 
who  can  incite  those  two  haughty  princes  to  take  arms  against 
thee.  It  is  not  fitting  for  thee,  whom  the  Gods  and  titans 
cannot  conquer,  to  rob  the  Nairritas,  whose  delight  thou  art,  of 
the  opportunity  of  witnessing  that  encounter !  They  are 
devoted  to  thy  welfare,  courageous,  disciplined  warriors 
distinguished  for  their  great  qualities,  intelligent,  renowned 
for  their  burning  ardour  and  fine  bearing.  Therefore  let 
some  of  these,  setting  out  under  thine  orders  to-day,  seize 
those  two  princes  and  establish  thy  supremacy  among  thy 
foes." 

On  this,  Ravana,  that  sagacious  Lord  of  the  Titans,  the 
formidable  foe  of  the  celestial  realm,  recognised  the  wisdom 
of  the  inspired  words  uttered  by  bis  younger  brother. 


chapter   53 

Hanuman  is  led  bound  through  the  City 

Hearing  the  words  of  his  high-souled  brother,  spoken  in 
consonance  with  time  and  place,  Dashagriva  answered  him 
saying : — 

"  Thou  hast  spoken  truly,  the  slaying  of  a  messenger  is  to 
be  deprecated,  it  is  therefore  necessary  to  inflict  some  punish- 
ment other  than  death  on  him.  In  the  case  of  monkeys,  the 
tail  is  unquestionably  the  most  cherished  embellishment, 
therefore  let  it  be  set  on  fire  and,  having  been  burnt  let  him  go, 
whereafter  his  friends,  kinsfolk  and  allies  as  all  those  dear  to 
him  shall  behold  him  degraded  and  mutilated.*' 

Then  the  Lord  of  the  Titans  issued  this  command : 
"  With  his  tail  in  flames,  let  him  be  led  through  the  city  of 
Lanka  and  its  highways." 

461 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Hearing  his  words,  the  titans  in  their  savage  fury  began  to 
wrap  the  tail  of  Hanuman  in  cotton  rags  and  thus  swathed, 
that  colossal  monkey  increased  in  size  like  unto  a  fire  in  a 
forest  fed  by  dry  wood.  And  having  soaked  the  cloths  in  oil, 
the  titans  set  them  on  fire  and  Hanuman,  filled  with  rage  and 
indignation,  his  face  shining  like  the  rising  sun,  lashed  out  at 
them  with  his  blazing  tail,  whereupon  that  lion  among  monkeys 
was  secured  more  tightly  by  the  assembled  demons.  Accom- 
panied by  women,  children  and  the  aged,  those  rangers  of  the 
night  gathered  to  enjoy  the  spectacle  and  the  valiant  Hanuman, 
who  was  bound,  began  to  reflect  on  the  matter  and  thought 
to  himself: — 

"  Assuredly,  though  fettered,  the  titans  are  not  able  to 
prevent  me  from  breaking  my  bonds  and  leaping  amongst  them 
creating  fresh  carnage,  still  it  is  in  the  interest  of  my  master 
that  I  have  taken  this  journey  and  it  is  under  the  orders  of  their 
lord  that  they  have  bound  me,  I  shall  not  therefore  resist 
them.  From  the  point  of  view  of  stature,  I  am  well  able  to 
engage  all  these  titans  in  battle  but  for  love  of  Rama  I  shall 
suffer  this  outrage.  I  shall  survey  Lanka  anew,  since  during 
the  night  I  was  not  able  to  view  the  fortifications,  it  proving 
too  difficult.  The  night  having  passed  I  shall  behold  Lanka 
by  day.  Let  them  bind  me  anew;  even  though  they  inflict 
pain  on  me  by  the  burning  of  my  tail,  my  mind  is  not  troubled." 

Meanwhile  the  titans  seizing  hold  of  that  great  monkey  of 
formidable  aspect  who  was  full  of  courage,  an  elephant  among 
apes,  exultant,  advanced  joyfully,  proclaiming  his  misdeeds 
with  conches  and  trumpets  and  those  demons  of  cruel  exploits 
dragged  Hanuman,  the  conqueror  of  his  foes,  through  the  city, 
he  willingly  submitting  himself  to  them. 

Thereupon,  passing  through  the  titan's  capital,  that  greaj 
monkey  surveyed  those  marvellous  palaces,  covered  highways, 
well  laid  out  squares  and  streets  flanked  with  mansions  and 
cross  roads,  lanes  and  alleys,  as  also  the  interior  of  the  dwellings 
and  on  the  terraces  and  roads  and  along  the  royal  highways  all 
those  titans  cried  out :  "  This  is  a  spy !  " 

Then  those  hideous  titan  women  informed  the  divine  Sita 
of  these  unpleasant  tidings,  saying : — "  O  Sita,  that  red-faced 
monkey,  who  had  converse  with  thee,  is  being  led  through  the 
462 


SUNDAVA    KANDA 

streets,  his  tail  ablaze."  And  hearing  those  words,  Vaidehi 
remembering  her  own  abduction,  overcome  with  grief,  having 
duly  purified  herself,  called  upon  that  God  who  nourishes 
himself  on  the  sacrifices  and  urgently  implored  him  to  show 
his  favour  to  that  mighty  monkey.  And  the  large-eyed  Sita, 
standing  before  the  fire  said :  **  If  I  am  possessed  of  true 
devotion  to  my  lord  and  have  practised  penances,  if  I  have 
been  a  chaste  wife,  then  do  thou  prove  cool  to  this  monkey. 
If  the  sagacious  Rama  still  has  any  compassion  for  me,  if  my 
merits  are  not  wholly  exhausted,  then  do  not  burn  Hanuman." 

Whereupon  Anala  of  ardent  rays,  as  if  communicating  with 
that  lady,  whose  eyes  were  like  a  doe's,  blazed  up  and,  at  the 
same  time,  Hanuman's  sire,  in  order  to  please  that  goddess, 
blew  on  that  flaming  tail  with  ice-cold  breath  and  the  monkey, 
whose  tail  was  ablaze,  thought : — "  How  is  it  that  this  fire, 
blazing  up,  does  not  burn  me  ?  I  see  a  great  flame,  yet  feel 
no  pain,  even  as  if  the  snow  had  fallen  upon  it.  In  sooth 
this  is  a  wonder  due  to  Rama's  power  which  I  witnessed  when 
crossing  the  main.  If  the  ocean  and  the  virtuous  Mainaka  acted 
in  such  a  manner,  in  reverence  for  him,  what  will  the  God  of 
Fire  not  do  ?  It  is  on  account  of  Sita's  virtue,  Raghava's  power 
and  my  sire's  affection  for  me,  that  Pavaka  does  not  burn  me." 

Thereafter  that  elephant  among  monkeys  reflected : — 
"  Why  should  a  warrior  such  as  I,  suffer  himself  to  be  bound 
by  these  vile  titans  ?  It  is  meet  that  I  should  manifest  my 
valour  and  avenge  myself !  " 

Then  that  impetuous  and  mighty  monkey  snapped  his  bonds 
and  springing  into  the  air  uttered  a  shout  and  that  offspring 
of  the  Wind-god  reached  the  gate  of  the  city  which  was  as 
high  as  the  peak  of  a  mountain  and  where  no  titans  were  to  be 
found.  Then,  he  who  resembled  a  great  hill,  assumed  a 
diminutive  form  and  casting  off  his  fetters  became  free,  where- 
upon he  expanded  to  the  size  of  a  mountain  once  more.  Look- 
ing about  him  he  observed  an  iron  bar  lying  at  the  gate  and  the 
long-armed  Maruti,  seizing  hold  of  that  weapon,  employed  it 
for  slaying  the  guards.  Having  destroyed  them,  in  his  ardour, 
that  one  of  exceeding  prowess,  with  the  burning  plume  of 
his  tail  resembling  an  aureole,  looking  like  the  glorious  sun 
surrounded  by  rays,  cast  his  eyes  over  Lanka. 
463 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER     54 

He  sets  fire  to  Lanka 

Surveying  Lanka,  that  monkey,  having  attained  his  purpose, 
began  to  consider  what  he  should  do  further  and  reflected  in 
himself: — "What  more  remains  for  me  to  do  to  afflict  the 
titans  ?  The  grove  laid  waste,  those  vile  titans  slain,  a  part  of 
the  army  destroyed,  nothing  is  left  for  me  but  to  demolish 
their  citadel.  With  their  fort  destroyed,  it  were  easy  to  bring 
my  labours  to  an  end ;  with  a  little  effort  I  can  complete  my 
task  and  obtain  the  price  of  my  trouble.  The  Bearer  of 
Sacrificial  Offerings  that  flames  on  my  tail  must  be  propitiated 
by  me,  I  shall  therefore  burn  up  these  excellent  buildings." 

Thereat,  with  his  tail  in  flames,  which  lent  him  the  appear- 
ance of  a  cloud  charged  with  lightning,  that  great  monkey 
began  to  range  the  roofs  of  the  dwellings  of  Lanka.  Glancing 
round,  passing  from  mansion  to  mansion,  with  a  calm  mind  he 
encircled  those  stately  edifices  and  gardens  and  leaping  im- 
petuously towards  the  palace  of  Prahasta,  that  one  of  exceeding 
prowess  in  strength  resembling  the  wind,  set  fire  to  it.  There- 
after the  mighty  Hanuman  bounded  to  the  mansion  of  Maha- 
parshwa  lighting  a  fire  equal  to  that  at  the  end  of  the  world. 
Then  that  monkey  of  immense  energy  leapt  on  the  residence  of 
Vajradanshtra  and  on  those  belonging  to  Shuka  and  the  in- 
telligent Sarana.  In  the  same  way  that  leader  of  monkeys 
burnt  down  the  habitations  of  Indrajita,  Jambumalin  and 
Sumali  and  those  of  the  titans  Rashmiketu,  Suryashatru, 
Hrasvakarna,  Damshtra,  Romasha,  Yuddhonmatta,  Matta, 
Dwajagriva,  Vidyujjihva  and  Hastimukha  and  the  dwellings 
of  Karala,  Vishala,  Shonitaksha,  Kumbhakarna,  Maharaksba, 
those  of  Narantaka,  Kumbha,  Nikumbha  and  the  magnanimous 
Yajnashatru  and   Brahmasharru. 

That  mighty  bull  among  monkeys  thereafter  set  fire  to  the 
accumulated  treasure  of  those  affluent  titans  and  having  passed 
4«4 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

over  the  other  dwellings  that  powerful  and  auspicious  one 
approached  the  residence  of  the  King  of  Titans.  Then  the 
virtuous  Hanuman,  emitting  loud  cries,  resembling  a  cloud  at 
the  dissolution  of  the  world,  with  the  tip  of  his  blazing  tail 
set  fire  to  that  foremost  of  buildings  decorated  with  every 
variety  of  gems  resembling  Mount  Meru  or  Mandara,  en- 
riched with  sumptuous  decoration. 

Fanned  by  the  wind,  the  flames  spread  everywhere,  casting 
livid  gleams  like  the  Fires  of  Time  and  those  palaces,  en- 
riched with  gold,  decorated  with  pearls  and  gems,  richly 
bejewelled,  toppled  to  earth,  crumbling  to  dust  like  the  mansions 
of  the  Celestials,  who  have  fallen  from  heaven  their  merit 
exhausted.  Then  there  arose  a  mighty  uproar  among  the 
titans,  who  fled  in  all  directions  unable  to  preserve  their  dwell- 
ings, bereft  of  their  treasure,  crying  out : — "  Verily  it  is  the 
God  of  Fire  himself  in  the  form  of  a  monkey !  " 

Some  of  the  titan  women  with  babies  at  their  breasts 
ran  shrieking  from  their  homes  and  some,  enveloped  in  flames, 
their  hair  in  disorder,  fell  from  the  high  balconies  like  flashes 
of  lightning  in  the  sky.  And  Hanuman  saw  various  metals 
flowing  in  a  molten  mass,  mixed  with  diamonds,  coral,  emeralds, 
pearls  and  silver,  streaming  from  the  palaces  and,  as  fire  is  not 
sated  in  consuming  wood  and  straw,  neither  did  Hanuman 
weary  of  slaying  those  leaders  of  titans  nor  the  earth  from 
receiving  their  corpses.  As  Rudra  consumed  the  Demon 
Tripura  so  did  that  impetuous  and  mighty  monkey  burn  up 
Lanka  and,  from  the  summit  of  that  mountain  where  Lanka 
stood,  that  dreadful  conflagration  kindled  by  the  intrepid 
Hanuman  shot  forth  in  tongues  of  flame.  Resembling  the 
fires  at  the  destruction  of  the  world,  the  smokeless  conflagration, 
lit  by  Maruta  blazed  up  to  the  skies  aided  by  the  wind,  feeding 
on  the  dwellings  of  the  titans  and  their  bodies  like 
sacrificial  offerings  and,  with  the  fierce  ardour  of  a  million 
suns,  it  consumed  Lanka  wholly  as  with  increasing  volume 
the  fire  cleaves  the  mundane  Egg  with  a  sound  resembling 
innumerable  thunderclaps.  That  fire  of  incalculable  fury, 
rising  into  the  sky,  with  its  flames  resembling  Kimshuka 
flowers,  its  clouds  of  smoke  like  unto  the  blue  lotus,  looked 
exceedingly  beautiful.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Verily  this  is  the  God  who  bears  the  thunderbolt,  Mahendra, 
the  Chief  of  the  Thirty  or  Yama  or  Varuna  or  Anila.  This  is 
no  monkey  but  the  God  of  Death  himself  who  has  come ! 
Or  perchance  it  is  a  manifestation  of  Brahma's  wrath,  the  four- 
faced  God  who,  in  the  form  of  a  monkey  has  come  hither  to 
destroy  the  titans  or  is  it  the  supreme  power  of  Vishnu,  un- 
imaginable, unutterable,  infinite  and  unsurpassed,  which,  by 
his  Maya,  has  assumed  the  form  of  a  monkey  ?  " 

Thus  did  the  chief  titans  speak,  being  assembled  and,  seeing 
their  city  suddenly  consumed  by  fire  with  its  inhabitants, 
horses,  chariots,  flocks  of  birds,  beasts  and  trees  they 
began  to  lament,  crying : — "  O  My  Father,  O  My  beloved 
Son,  O  My  dear  One,  O  My  Friend  !  Woe,  alas  !  O  My  Lord, 
our  spiritual  merit  is  exhausted ! "  Thus  amidst,  a  frightful 
clamour,  did  the  titans  cry  aloud,  and  Lanka,  encircled  with 
flames,  her  heroes  slain,  her  warriors  succumbing  to  the  swift 
wrath  of  Hanuman,  appeared  to  have  fallen  under  a  curse. 
In  the  midst  of  the  tumult  Hanuman  with  pride,  surveyed 
Lanka  bearing  the  marks  of  that  violent  blaze  and  its  terror- 
stricken  demons  as  Swyambhu  surveys  the  final  destruction  of 
the  world. 

Having  demolished  the  grove  planted  with  rare  trees  and 
slain  those  powerful  titans  in  combat  and  burned  that  city 
filled  with  splendid  palaces,  that  monkey  born  of  Favana 
rested. 

Having  dispatched  those  titans  in  great  numbers,  destroyed 
the  dense  woods  and  spread  the  fire  amongst  the  titan  dwell- 
ings, the  illustrious  Hanuman  became  absorbed  in  the  thought 
of  Rama. 

Thereupon  all  the  Celestials  lauded  that  prince  among  monkey 
warriors  endowed  with  immense  energy,  equal  to  Maruta  in 
swiftness,  that  sagacious  and  excellent  son  of  Vayu.  And  all 
the  Gods,  the  foremost  of  the  Ascetics,  the  Gandharvas, 
Vidyadharas,  Pannagas  and  Bhutas  experienced  an  exceeding 
and  indescribable  joy. 

And  having  devastated  the  forest,  slain  the  titans  in  conflict 

and  burnt  the  great  city  of  Lanka,  that  mighty  monkey,  seated 

on  the  roof  of  the  foremost  of  buildings,  spreading  the  rays  of 

his  flaming  tail  like  a  aureole,  resembled  the  sun  encircled  with 

466 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

a  nimbus.  Then  having  consumed  the  city  of  Lanka,  that  great 
monkey  quenched  the  fire  of  his  tail  in  the  sea. 

Beholding  Lanka  consumed  by  fire,  the  Gods,  Gandharvas, 
Siddhas  and  great  ascetics  were  struck  with  amazement. 


chapter    55 

Hanuman's  Anxiety  concerning  Sita 

Seeing  Lanka  consumed  by  fire  and  that  city  with  its  terror- 
stricken  titans  filled  with  tumult,  the  monkey  Hanuman 
became  thoughtful  and  a  great  anxiety  invaded  his  mind. 

He  reflected : — "  In  burning  Lanka,  I  have  without  doubt 
done  something  reprehensible !  Blessed  are  those  great  souls, 
who,  in  their  wisdom  extinguish  the  anger  born  within  them 
as  a  fire  is  quenched  by  water.  What  evil  is  not  committed  by 
those  who  give  way  to  wrath?  In  anger  one  may  even  slay 
one's  spiritual  preceptor ;  nor  does  he  who  is  enraged,  refrain 
from  affronting  virtuous  men.  He  who  gives  way  to  wrath 
is  unable  to  discriminate  as  to  when  it  is  fitting  to  speak  or 
when  to  be  silent ;  there  is  no  iniquity  that  cannot  be  per- 
petrated by  him.  He  is  truly  said  to  be  a  man,  who,  con- 
trolling himself,  subdues  the  anger  rising  within  him  as  a 
snake  casts  off  its  slough.  Woe  is  me,  wretched  and  shameless 
doer  of  evil  that  I  am,  who,  forgetting  Sita,  have  slain  my  lord 
by  fire.  Should  that  noble  daughter  of  Janaka  have  perished 
in  this  conflagration,  which  has  wholly  consumed  the  city  of 
Lanka,  I  have  frustrated  the  purpose  of  my  master ;  Sita 
having  been  burnt,  I  have  marred  my  lord's  design.  To 
burn  down  Lanka  is  a  trifling  occurrence,  but  suffering  myself 
to  be  overcome  by  anger  I  have  cut  at  the  very  root  of  my 
mission.  Assuredly  Janaki  has  perished  for  there  remains  no 
corner  of  Lanka  that  has  not  been  laid  waste,  the  entire  city 
lies  in  ashes.  Since  I  have  sacrified  everything  through  my 
lack  of  understanding,  I  shall  yield  up  my  life  this  instant, 
either  I  shall  throw  myself  into  the  fire  or  into  the  jaws  of 
Vadava,  or  give  my  body  to  the  denizens  of  the  deep.  Living, 
I  am  not  able  to  face  the  King  of  the  Monkeys  or  those  two 
4*7  «H 


THE   RAMAYANA    OF   VALMIKI 

tigers  among  men,  having  marred  their  purpose.  Through  my 
culpable  anger  I  have  manifested  my  undisciplined  simian 
nature  to  the  Three  Worlds.  Woe  to  the  unbridled  passion, 
uncurbed  and  unrestrained,  under  which  I  failed  to  protect 
Sita  when  it  was  in  my  power  to  do  so.  She,  having  perished, 
those  two  heroes  will  die  also  and  on  their  ceasing  to  exist, 
Sugriva  will  yield  up  his  life  with  all  his  kinsfolk.  On  hearing 
these  tidings,  how  shall  the  virtuous  Bharata,  devoted  to  his 
brother  or  Shatrughna,  survive?  Then  on  the  extinction  of 
the  illustrious  race  of  Ikshwaku,  their  subjects  will  be  overcome 
with  grief. 

"  Unfortunate  am  I,  whose  merits  have  been  annulled 
through  being  false  to  the  ties  of  duty  and  advantage,  suffering 
myself  to  be  dominated  by  a  corrupting  passion,  thus  becoming 
the  destroyer  of  creatures  !  " 

Immersed  in  these  melancholy  reflections,  Hanuman  re- 
collected certain  auspicious  signs  that  he  had  previously 
observed  and  said  to  himself: — ■ 

"  Is  it  possible  that  that  Lovely  One,  protected  by  her  own 
spiritual  merit,  has  happily  escaped  death  ?  Fire  cannot  burn 
fire !  Nay,  Pavaka  would  not  dare  to  approach  that  virtuous 
one,  preserved  by  her  own  purity,  who  is  the  consort  of  one  of 
immeasurable  glory.  That  Bearer  of  Sacrificial  Offerings  has 
not  burned  me  owing  to  Rama's  power  and  the  virtue  of 
Vaidehi.  How  should  she  therefore,  the  object  of  worship  of 
those  three  brothers,  Bharata  and  the  others  and  the  beloved 
of  Rama's  heart,  perish  ?  Since  it  is  the  nature  of  fire  to  burn, 
he  who  reigns  invincible  as  master  everywhere  yet  who  has 
not  burned  my  tail,  why  should  he  consume  that  exalted  One  ?  " 

Thereafter  Hanuman  remembered  with  wonder  how  the 
Mainaka  bill  had  appeared  to  him  in  the  ocean  and  he  reflected: 
"  By  virtue  of  her  asceticism,  sincerity  and  undeviating  devotion 
to  her  lord,  she  is  able  to  consume  fire  itself  but  it  cannot 
consume  her." 

Pondering  thus  on  the  magnitude  of  the  divine  Sita's 
spiritual  merit,  Hanuman  heard  the  high-souled  Charanas 
conversing  thus : — 

"Assuredly  Hanuman  has  accomplished  a  difficult  feat  in 
igniting  a  fierce  and  terrible  fire  in  the  dwellings  of  the  titans. 
468 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

The  hosts  of  women,  children  and  the  aged  are  fleeing  away 
and  the  tumult  re-echoes  as  in  a  cavern ;  the  city  of  Lanka 
with  its  towers,  walls  and  gateways  is  wholly  consumed  but 
Janaki  still  lives,  a  great  wonder !  " 

Such  were  the  words,  resembling  ambrosia,  which  fell  on 
Hanuman's  ears  and  from  that  instant,  happiness  flooded  his 
heart  once  more.  On  account  of  the  auspicious  portents,  his 
own  conclusions,  the  merits  of  Sita  and  the  words  of  the  saints, 
Hanuman  was  delighted  beyond  measure.  Thereupon  that 
monkey,  having  attained  his  end,  knowing  the  princess  to  be 
safe,  resolved  to  leave  Lanka  after  seeing  her  once  more. 


chapter   56 

He  takes  leave  of  Sita 

Paying  obeisance  to  Janaki  seated  at  the  foot  of  the  Shimshapa 
tree,  Hanuman  said  to  her :  "  By  the  grace  of  heaven  I  find 
thee  unharmed !  " 

Looking  on  him  again  and  again  as  he  stood  ready  to  depart, 
Sita,  inspired  by  conjugal  affection,  said  to  him : — 

"  If,  O  Child,  thou  judgest  it  opportune,  then,  O  Irre- 
proachable Friend,  remain  here  in  some  hidden  spot  to-day; 
to-morrow,  having  rested,  do  thou  set  out.  Thy  proximity, 
O  Monkey,  will  make  me  forget  mine  overwhelming  grief 
awhile.  Thou  wilt  go,  O  Great  Monkey  and  it  is  doubtful 
whether  I  shall  still  be  living  on  thy  return,  O  Foremost  of 
Monkeys !  In  thine  absence  my  torments  will  increase  and 
falling  into  one  misfortune  after  another,  I  shall  be  consumed 
with  grief  and  sorrow.  Further,  O  Hero,  this  fear  is  ever 
present  with  me ;  how  will  the  most  valiant  Sugriva  or  that 
host  of  bears  and  monkeys  cross  the  impassable  ocean  or 
those  two  sons  of  men  supported  by  those  powerful  monkeys  ? 
Three  beings  alone  are  able  to  bound  over  the  deep,  Vainateya, 
thou  and  Maruta. 

"  In  the  face  of  this  insurmountable  obstacle,  in  thy  con- 
summate experience  dost  thou  see  any  possibility  of  success  ? 
4*9 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

0  Destroyer  of  Hostile  Warriors,  thou  alone  art  competent  to 
perform  this  task,  thou  shalt  attain  renown  by  thy  prowess ; 
yet,  if  Kakutstha,  the  scourge  of  his  foes  were  able  to  lay 
Lanka  waste  with  his  forces  and  bear  me  away,  it  would  be 
worthy  of  him.  Therefore  do  that  which  will  enable  the 
magnanimous  Rama  to  manifest  his  prowess  in  conformity 
with  a  warrior's  nature." 

Hearing  these  words  full  of  loving  solicitude,  reason  and 
significance,  the  valiant  Hanuman  answered : — 

"  O  Noble  Lady,  that  lord  and  foremost  of  monkeys,  Sugriva, 
endowed  with  power,  has  resolved  to  deliver  thee.  Attended 
by  thousands  of  billions  of  powerful  monkeys,  he  will  not  delay 
in  coming  hither,  O  Vaidehi,  and  those  foremost  of  men,  the 
flower  of  the  human  race,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  coming  here, 
will  afflict  Lanka  with  their  arrows.  Having  destroyed  the 
titans  and  their  adherents,  the  son  of  Raghu,  O  Exceedingly 
Fair  One,  shall  bear  thee  away  and  bring  thee  to  his  capital. 
Take  heart,  therefore,  O  Gentle  One  and  await  that  hour ! 
Soon  shalt  thou  see  Rama  strike  down  Ravana  on  the  field  of 
battle.  The  Lord  of  the  Titans  slain  with  his  sons,  ministers 
and  people,  thou  shalt  be  re-united  with  Rama,  as  Rohmi 
with  the  moon.  Ere  long  Kakutstha  will  appear  accompanied 
by  the  foremost  of  monkeys  and  bears  and,  triumphing  in  the 
fight,  shall  remove  thy  grief." 

Having  thus  consoled  Vaidehi,  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta, 
prepared  to  depart,  offering  salutations  to  her  and,  having 
comforted  her  and  displayed  his  surpassing  strength  by  render- 
ing that  city  desolate,  having  thwarted  Ravana  and  exhibited 
his  immeasurabke  power,  Hanuman,  paying  obeisance  to 
Vaidehi,  intent  on  returning,  resolved  to  cross  the  ocean  once 
more. 

Then  the  repressor  of  his  foes,  that  powerful  monkey,  eager 
to  see  his  lord,  ascended  the  foremost  of  mountains,  Arishta, 
covered  with  dark  groves  of  Fadmaka  trees,  resembling  a 
mantle  which,  with  the  clouds  clinging  to  its  sides,  seemed  to 
expand  with  joy  under  the  sun's  rays ;  the  metals  scattered  here 
and  there  appeared  to  be  its  eyes  and  the  solemn  sound  of  its 
torrents  resembled  its  voice  chanting  the  Veda;  the  water- 
Ms,  the  singing  of  its  song  and  the  tall  Devadaru  trees  caused 
470 


SIUNDARA    KANDA 

the  mountain  to  resemble  a  giant  with  uplifted  arms,  the 
thundering  of  the  torrents  were  its  cries  re-echoing  round 
about  and  the  autumnal  woods  agitated  by  the  wind  made  it 
appear  as  if  it  trembled ;  as  the  breeze  whistled  through  the 
reeds,  it  seemed  to  be  piping  while  great  and  venomous  ser- 
pents created  the  illusion  of  its  hissing  in  anger.  With  its 
ravines  shrouded  in  mist,  investing  it  with  a  solemn  air,  as  if  it 
were  deeply  absorbed  in  contemplation  and  the  clouds  moving 
here  and  there  on  its  slopes  lending  it  the  appearance  of  walking; 
with  its  peaks  towering  heavenwards,  so  that  it  appeared  to  be 
yawning,  it  was  bristling  with  escarpments  and  filled  with 
innumerable  caves.  Planted  with  Sala,  Tala.  Kharjura, 
Tamala,  Kama  and  Vanisha  trees  with  a  myriad  creepers  laden 
with  flowers  and  abounding  in  herds  of  deer  and  containing 
innumerable  streams,  with  countless  crags,  rich  in  minerals, 
intersected  by  rills,  frequented  by  Maharishis,  Yakshas, 
Gandharvas,  Kinneras  and  Uragas,  impenetrable  on  account 
of  the  thorns  and  briars,  its  caves  were  filled  with  lions,  and 
tigers  and  other  beasts  abounded  there  and  that  mountain 
was  furnished  with  trees  having  delicious  fruit  and  roots. 

Then  the  foremost  of  monkeys,  the  son  of  Anila,  ascended 
that  mountain  burning  to  behold  Rama  once  more  and,  wherever 
he  placed  his  foot  on  those  enchanting  slopes,  the  rocks  crumbled 
and  broke  away  with  a  thundering  sound. 

Having  scaled  the  Indra  of  Mountains,  that  mighty  monkey 
gathered  up  his  strength,  desirous  of  crossing  from  the  southern 
to  the  northern  shore  of  the  salty  sea  and,  reaching  the  summit, 
he  beheld  that  formidable  expanse  of  water  inhabited  by 
dreadful  monsters.  Then  the  son  of  Maruta,  with  the  swift- 
ness of  the  wind  as  it  blows  through  space,  leapt  from  the 
southern  region  to  the  northern  shore  and,  pressed  under 
foot  by  that  monkey,  the  mountain  giant  re-echoing  to  the 
cries  of  countless  denizens  sank  into  the  bosom  of  the  earth 
with  its  peaks  toppling  and  its  trees  overturned.  Borne  down 
by  Hanuman's  prodigious  bounds,  trees  laden  with  blossom 
fell  to  the  ground  as  if  struck  by  Indra's  thunderbolt  and  the 
dreadful  roar  of  great  lions  lurking  in  the  caverns  rent  the 
skies  as  they  were  crushed  by  the  falling  mountain.  Vidya- 
dharas,  their  raiment  torn  and  their  ornaments  in  disorder, 
47i 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

fled  in  terror  from  that  place  and  large  and  powerful  serpents, 
filled  with  poison,  shooting  out  their  tongues,  lay  in  coiled 
heaps,  their  heads  and  necks  crushed.  Kinneras,  Uragas, 
Gandharvas,  Yakshas  and  Vidyadharas,  deserting  that  mountain, 
returned  to  the  celestial  realm  and  that  mighty  hill,  measuring 
forty  miles  in  extent  and  thirty  in  height,  was  levelled  to  the 
earth  with  its  trees  and  lofty  summits 

Then  that  monkey,  desirous  of  crossing  over  the  salty  sea, 
whose  shores  were  threatened  by  the  tides,  rose  into  the  air. 


chapter   57 

The  Return  of  Hanuman 

Like  a  winged  mountain,  with  one  impetuous  bound,  Hanuman 
sailed  over  the  airy  sea,  whose  serpents  were  the  Yakshas  and 
the  full-blown  lotuses;  the  Gandharvas  the  moon  was  the 
lily  on  those  enchanting  waters,  the  sun  its  waterfowl,  Tishya 
and  Shravana  its  swans  and  the  clouds  its  reeds  and  moss ; 
Pumavasu  was  the  whale  and  Lohitanga  the  crocodile ;  Airavata 
the  spacious  island ;  Swati,  its  decoration  in  the  form  of  a 
swan;  the  breezes  were  its  billows  and  the  rays  of  the  moon 
its  cool  and  peaceful  waves. 

Unwearyingly,  Hanuman  swallowing  up  that  space  adorned 
with  the  sun  and  stars,  skimmed  past  the  King  of  the  Planets. 
Cleaving  the  clouds  and  crossing  that  ocean  without  fatigue,  he 
beheld  great  masses  of  cloud,  white,  roseate,  purple,  blue, 
yellow  and  black,  looking  exceedingly  beautiful  and  he, 
entering  and  re-emerging  from  them,  looked  like  the  moon, 
when  it  is  lost  to  sight  and  becomes  visible  again.  Coursing 
through  those  massed  clouds  in  his  white  attire,  that  hero 
could  at  times  be  seen  and  again  was  hidden  in  the  sky,  like 
unto  the  moon.  Borne  through  space,  that  son  of  the  Wind 
constantly  dispersed  the  groups  of  clouds,  sailing  on  and  on, 
emitting  loud  roars  resembling  thunder  and,  having  slain  the 
titans,  rendered  his  name  famous,  laid  the  city  of  Lanka  waste, 
47a 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

harassed  Ravana,  inflicted  defeat  on  those  mighty  warriors 
and  paid  homage  to  Vaidehi,  he  was  now  returning  full  of 
glory,  across  the  sea. 

And  that  one  endowed  with  prowess,  paid  homage  to  the 
foremost  of  mountains,  Mainaka,  as  he  sped  on  like  an  arrow 
loosed  from  the  bowstring.  Approaching  from  afar,  he 
observed  that  lofty  Mountain  Mahendra,  like  a  great  cloud 
and  that  mighty  monkey,  having  a  lusty  voice  resembling 
thunder,  filled  the  ten  cardinal  points  with  his  roars. 

Reaching  the  southern  shore,  eager  to  see  his  friends  once 
again,  he  began  to  wave  his  tail  to  and  fro  and  emit  loud  cries 
and  as  he  proceeded  in  the  path  of  Suparna,  the  clamour  rent 
the  skies  and  it  appeared  as  if  the  firmament  and  the  sun's 
disc  were  shattered. 

Thereupon  those  mighty  warriors  on  the  northern  shore  of 
the  ocean,  anxiously  awaiting  the  Wind-god's  offspring, 
heard  the  sound  created  by  the  thighs  of  Hanuman  proceeding 
at  great  speed,  resembling  clouds  blown  by  the  wind  and 
those  rangers  of  the  woods,  who  had  been  dispirited,  heard 
the  roars  of  that  monkey  which  were  like  unto  thunder.  Hearing 
that  clamour  raised  by  Hanuman,  those  monkeys  who  were 
eager  to  see  their  friend  once  again,  were  gready  excited  and 
Jambavan,  the  foremost  of  the  monkeys,  his  heart  exultant, 
addressing  them  all,  spoke  thus : — 

"  Undoubtedly  Hanuman  has  been  wholly  successful  in  his 
enterprise ;  if  it  were  not  so  he  would  not  have  raised  this 
clamour." 

Thereupon  the  monkeys,  hearing  the  violent  movements  of 
that  magnanimous  one,  as  also  his  shouts,  highly  delighted, 
leapt  up  and  in  their  joy,  bounding  from  rock  to  rock  and  from 
crest  to  crest,  eager  to  behold  Hanuman,  climbed  to  the  tops 
of  the  trees  waving  their  clean  apparel. 

And  the  roaring  of  the  mighty  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta, 
resembled  the  wind  whistling  through  a  mountain  gorge. 
Seeing  that  great  ape,  who,  alighting,  shone  like  a  mass  of 
clouds,  all  the  monkeys  stood  before  him  with  joined  palms, 
whereupon  that  valiant  monkey,  high  as  a  hill,  leapt  down 
on  to  the  Mahendra  Mountain  covered  with  trees  and,  over- 
flowing with  felicity,  he  alighted  on  that  lofty  and  enchanting 
473 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

peak,  like  a  winged  hill,  whose  pinions  have  been  dipt  and  who 
has  fallen  from  the  sky. 

Then  instantly  all  the  monkeys  with  glad  hearts  began  to 
gather  round  the  magnanimous  Hanuman,  encircling  him,  their 
faces  shining  with  joy,  drawing  near  to  him  in  the  excess 
of  their  felicity.  Then  offering  obeisance  to  him  they  brought 
roots  and  fruits  to  that  greatest  of  monkeys,  born  of  Maruta. 
In  their  delight,  some  emitted  shouts  of  joy  and  the  foremost 
of  the  monkeys  brought  branches  of  trees  so  that  he  might 
be  seated. 

Meanwhile  that  mighty  ape,  Hanuman,  paid  obeisance  to 
his  elders  and  the  aged  with  Jambavan  at  their  head,  as  well 
as  Prince  Angada.  And  honoured  by  them  all,  as  he  had 
merited  to  be  and  overwhelmed  by  courtesies,  he  informed 
them  briefly : — "  I  have  seen  the  Goddess !  "  Then  taking 
the  hand  of  Bali's  son,  he  sat  down  in  the  enchanting  grove  on 
the  Mahendra  Mountain  and,  questioned  by  them,  he  joyfully 
addressed  those  foremost  of  monkeys,  saying : — 

"  In  the  midst  of  the  Ashoka  grove,  I  observed  Janata; 
that  irreproachable  one  is  guarded  by  dreadful  titan  women. 
That  damsel  is  wearing  a  single  plait  of  hair  and  constantly 
sighs  for  Rama's  presence.  She  is  faint  on  account  of  fasting, 
stained  with  dust,  emaciated,  and  wears  matted  locks." 

Those  foremost  of  monkeys,  hearing  the  words  of  Maruti : 
"  I  have  seen  her ",  sweet  as  Amrita,  intoxicated  with  joy 
began  to  shout  and  emitting  cries  of  pleasure  raised  ululations. 
Some  waved  their  tails  to  and  fro,  others  raised  them  up 
lashing  them  or  bounded  to  the  summit  and  with  delight 
touched  the  fortunate  Hanuman,  that  chief  of  monkeys. 

And  when  Hanuman  had  spoken,  Angada,  in  the  midst  of 
those  valiant  monkeys,  paid  tribute  to  Hanuman  in  excellent 
words,  saying : — 

"  For  valour  and  courage  thou  hast  no  equal,  O  Monkey, 
since  thou  hast  crossed  the  immense  ocean  and  hast  now 
returned.  Thou  alone  hast  given  us  back  our  lives,  O  Great 
One.  By  thy  grace,  our  purpose  accomplished,  we  can  rejoin 
Raghava.  O  What  devotion  thou  hast  shown  to  thy  master ! 
What  prowess !  What  endurance !  By  the  grace  of  heaven, 
thou  hast  seen  the  divine  and  glorious  consort  of  Rama.  By 
474 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

the  grace  of  heaven,  Kakutstha  will  abandon  the  grief  that 
Sita's  absence  has  caused  him ! " 

Thereafter,  surrounding  Angada,  Hanuman  and  Jambavan, 
the  monkeys  full  of  joy  brought  large  rocks  and,  seated  thereon, 
eager  to  hear  how  he  had  crossed  the  main  and  seen  Lanka, 
Sita  and  Havana,  they  waited  with  joined  palms,  their  eyes 
fixed  on  Maruti. 

And  the  youthful  Angada,  surrounded  by  innumerable 
monkeys,  resembled  the  Chief  of  the  Gods  enthroned  in 
heaven  amidst  the  myriad  hosts. 

When  the  glorious  and  renowned  Hanuman  with  the  illus- 
trious Angada,  who  was  adorned  with  bracelets  were  seated, 
that  elevated  and  mighty  peak  shone  with  splendour. 


CHAPTER    58 

Hanuman  recounts  his  Experiences 

Thereafter,  on  the  summit  of  Mount  Mahendra,  those 
monkeys,  their  eyes  fixed  on  the  mighty  Hanuman  were  filled 
with  delight  and  when  all  those  high-souled  and  happy 
monkeys  were  seated,  Jambavan,  glad  at  heart,  enquired  of  the 
great  and  fortunate  offspring  of  the  Wind  concerning  the 
success  of  his  mission,  saying  : — 

"  How  didst  thou  discover  that  noble  lady ;  how  doth  she 
fare  there ;  how  doth  that  cruel  Ten-headed  One  bear  himself 
towards  her  ?  Do  thou  truthfully  relate  all  this  unto  us,  O 
Mighty  Monkey ! 

"  How  wast  thou  able  to  trace  the  divine  Sita  ?  What  did 
she  reply  to  thine  enquiries  ?  Having  learnt  all,  we  can  take 
counsel  as  to  what  should  be  done !  Do  thou  tell  us  also  what, 
on  our  return,  we  should  say  and  what  we  should  conceal, 
O  Thou  who  art  well  able  to  subdue  thyself! " 

Thereupon,  that  messenger,  his  hair  standing  on  end  with 
joy  on  hearing  these  words,  inclining  his  head  in  token  of  bis 
reverence  for  Sita,  answered : — 

475 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  In  your  presence  I  leapt  from  the  summit  of  the  Mahendra 
Mountain  into  space  with  a  concentrated  mind,  desirous  of 
reaching  the  southern  shore  of  the  sea.  In  my  course,  a 
formidable  obstacle  presented  itself  to  my  view  and  I  beheld 
a  great  mountain  having  a  golden  peak,  divine  and  splendid, 
which  obstructed  my  path.  Approaching  the  sun-like  summit 
of  that  mighty  mountain,  reflecting :  '  I  will  shatter  this ',  I 
struck  it  with  my  tail  and  that  peak  which  shone  like  the  sun, 
broke  into  a  thousand  fragments.  Seeing  its  condition,  that 
great  mountain  addressed  me  in  sweet  accents,  bringing  as  it 
were  refreshment  to  my  soul,  and  said : 

" '  Know  me,  O  My  Son,  to  be  the  brother  of  thy  father 
Matarishvat,  famed  as  Mainaka,  dwelling  in  the  deep. 
Formerly,  all  the  larger  mountains  were  furnished  with  wings 
and  ranged  over  the  earth  causing  devastation  everywhere. 
Hearing  of  the  conduct  of  those  mountains,  Mahendra,  that 
blessed  One,  by  whom  Faka  was  chastised,  with  his  thunder- 
bolt severed  the  wings  of  those  mountains  by  thousands  but 
I  was  delivered  by  thine  illustrious  sire  and  that  high-souled 
Wind-god  cast  me  into  the  sea,  the  abode  of  Varuna.  O 
Subduer  of  thy  Foes,  I  am  willing  to  render  assistance  to 
Raghava,  Rama  is  the  foremost  among  virtuous  men  and  is  as 
powerful  as  Mahendra  himself'. 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  the  magnanimous  Mainaka,  I  con- 
fided my  purpose  to  him  and  he  gave  me  leave  to  depart. 
Then,  counselling  me  to  proceed,  he  vanished  in  his  human 
form  and  in  the  shape  of  a  mountain  became  submerged  in 
the  sea. 

"  For  a  long  time  I  travelled  onward  with  speed  till  I  observed 
the  divine  Surasa,  Mother  of  Serpents,  in  the  midst  of  the 
ocean  and  that  Goddess  addressed  me  saying : — 

'"Thou  art  destined  by  the  Celestials  to  be  my  food,  O 
Best  of  Monkeys,  I  am  about  to  devour  thee  since  thou  hast 
been  assigned  to  me'. 

"  Hearing  this,  I,  with  humility,  turning  pale,  made  obeisance 
to  her  with  joined  palms  and  uttered  these  words : — 

" '  Rama,  the  fortunate  son  of  Dasaratha,  the  Scourge  of 
his  Foes,  withdrew  to  the  Dandaka  Forest  with  his  brother 
Lakshmana  and  Sita ;  his  consort  was  borne  away  by  the  wicked 
47« 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Ravana ;  I  am  proceeding  to  her  on  Rama's  behest.  In  this 
matter  thou  shouldst  assist  Rama.  Having  seen  Mithila's 
daughter  as  also  her  lord  of  imperishable  exploits,  I  shall 
return  and  enter  thy  mouth,  this  I  promise  thee '. 

"  Thus  accosted  by  me,  Surasa,  able  to  change  her  form  at 
will,  said :  '  None  is  able  to  pass  by  me,  this  is  the  boon  I 
have  received  \ 

"  Thus  addressed  by  Surasa,  I  attained  the  magnitude  of 
ten  yojanas  and  then  another  ten,  but  her  mouth  assumed  even 
greater  proportions.  Seeing  her  jaws  thus  dilated,  I  instantly 
assumed  a  tiny  form  measuring  a  thumb's  size  and  quickly 
entered  her  mouth,  emerging  immediately,  whereupon  the 
divine  Surasa,  taking  on  her  normal  shape,  said  to  me : — 

"  '  O  Best  of  Monkeys,  O  Dear  One,  go,  accomplish  thy 
mission  and  restore  Vaidehi  to  the  magnanimous  Rama.  Be 
thou  blessed,  O  Mighty  One  !   I  am  pleased  with  thee ! ' 

"  Then  all  beings  praised  me  saying:  *  Excellent!  Excellent! ' 
and  I  again  leapt  into  the  infinite  blue  like  unto  Garuda, 
when  suddenly,  without  anything  being  visible,  my  shadow 
was  held  fast.  Stayed  in  my  course,  I  surveyed  the  ten  car- 
dinal points  unable  to  discover  who  held  me  prisoner.  Then 
the  thought  came  to  me :  *  What  is  this  obstacle  that  has 
risen  in  my  path  ?  X  cannot  discern  its  nature ! '  And  as  I 
looked  down  bewildered,  I  beheld  a  dreadful  demon  lying  in 
the  waves,  thereupon  that  monster,  laughing  scornfully,  addressed 
these  inauspicious  words  to  me,  who  though  undaunted, 
remained  motionless : — 

" '  Whither  art  thou  bound,  O  Thou  of  gigantic  form  ?  Do 
thou  become  my  food,  who  am  hungry,  and  gratify  this  body 
deprived  of  sustenance  for  a  long  period.'  Saying : — '  Be  it 
so'  I  expanded  my  body  to  more  than  the  capacity  of  her 
mouth  but  she  increased  the  size  of  her  huge  and  dreadful 
jaws  in  order  to  swallow  me  nor  could  she  comprehend  that  I 
was  able  to  assume  different  shapes  at  will.  In  the  twinkling 
of  an  eye,  abandoning  my  vast  size,  I,  extracting  her  heart, 
flew  into  the  sky. 

"  Throwing  up  her  arms,  that  cruel  demon  sank  under  the 
salty  waves  like  a  mountain,  whereupon  I  heard  the  har- 
monious voices  of  those  magnanimous  beings  stationed  in  the 
477 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

air,  saying : — '  That  dreadful  demon  Sinhika  has  been  swiftly 
slain  by  Hanuman.' 

"  That  monster  destroyed,  I  recalled  to  mind  the  urgency  of 
my  mission,  and  the  delay  that  had  occurred  in  discharging  it 
and,  after  traversing  a  great  distance,  I  beheld  the  southern 
shore  of  the  ocean  and  the  mountain  on  which  Lanka  was 
situated.  The  sun  having  set,  I  penetrated  the  abode  of  the 
titans  unnoticed  by  them  and,  as  X  did  so,  a  woman  resembling 
the  clouds  at  the  end  of  the  world  period  rose  before  me, 
breaking  into  laughter.  Striking  that  exceedingly  dreadful  form, 
having  flames  for  her  hair,  who  had  sought  to  take  my  life, 
with  my  left  fist  I  thrust  her  aside  and  entered  there  at  dusk, 
whereupon  that  one,  affrighted,  addressed  me  saying : — 

"  I  am  the  city  of  Lanka,  O  Warrior !  Vanquished  have  I 
been  by  thy  prowess,  thou  shalt  also  triumph  over  all  the  titans !  * 

"  Meanwhile  I  sought  for  Janaka's  daughter  all  through  the 
night,  penetrating  into  Ravana's  inner  apartments,  but  did  not 
find  her  there.  Not  rinding  Sita  in  Ravana's  palace,  I  was 
submerged  in  a  sea  of  sorrow  and  in  the  midst  of  my  distress 
I  saw  an  enchanting  grove  with  a  mansion  surrounded  by 
a  lofty  golden  wall.  Having  scaled  that  enclosure  I  beheld  a 
grove  of  Ashoka  trees  in  the  midst  of  which  a  great  Shimshapa 
grew.  Ascending  it,  I  observed  a  thicket  of  golden  aspens  and 
hard  by  the  Shimshapa  tree,  I  beheld  that  supremely  beautiful 
one,  dark  blue  of  hue,  whose  eyes  resembled  lotus  petals,  clad 
in  a  single  piece  of  cloth.  Emaciated  with  fasting,  her  hair 
soiled  with  dust,  Sita,  fixed  in  devotion  to  her  lord,  was 
surrounded  by  cruel  and  hideous  titan  women  living  on 
blood  and  flesh,  as  a  doe  encircled  by  tigresses.  Wearing  a 
single  plait,  absorbed  in  the  thought  of  her  lord,  lying  on  the 
earth,  her  limbs  wasted,  she  resembled  a  lotus  at  the  advent  of 
winter.  Deprived  by  Ravana  of  the  object  of  her  desire,  she 
had  resolved  to  die. 

"  Beholding  that  lady,  whose  eyes  resembled  a  doe's,  the 
illustrious  consort  of  Rama,  I  remained  seated  in  the  Shimshapa 
tree. 

"  Thereafter  I  heard  a  great  clamour  mixed  with  the  jingling 
of  girdles  and  anklets,  issuing  from  the  palace  of  Ravana  and, 
exceedingly  agitated,  contracting  my  body,  I  concealed  myself 
478 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

like  a  bird  in  die  thick  foliage  of  the  Shimshapa  tree.  There- 
upon the  mighty  Havana  accompanied  by  his  consorts  came 
to  the  place  where  Sita  was  and,  seeing  the  Lord  of  the  Titans, 
Janaki  of  lovely  hips,  shrank  into  herself,  concealing  her 
breasts  with  her  arms  and,  in  great  dread  and  extreme  con- 
fusion, glancing  here  and  there  and  finding  no  refuge,  that 
unfortunate  being  was  seized  with  violent  trembling, 

"  Then  Dashagriva,  inclining  bis  head,  bowed  to  the  feet  of 
the  princess,  who  was  overcome  with  extreme  grief  and  said 
to  her : — 

"  *  O  Fair  One,  do  thou  regard  me  with  favour !  If,  O  Sita, 
through  pride,  thou  dost  refuse  to  honour  me,  at  the  end  of 
two  months  I  shall  drink  thy  blood ! ' 

"  Hearing  these  words  spoken  by  the  wicked  Ravana,  Janaki 
growing  exceedingly  wrath,  answered  with  dignity : — 

" '  O  Vilest  of  Titans,  having  uttered  such  a  speech  to  the 
consort  of  Rama  of  immeasurable  prowess,  to  me,  the  daughter- 
in-law  of  Dasaratha  of  the  Ikshwaku  line,  why  has  thy  tongue 
not  fallen  out  ?  O  Vile  Wretch,  great  indeed  was  thy  valour 
to  bear  me  hence  far  from  the  illustrious  Rama,  in  his  absence ! 
Thou  art  not  even  worthy  to  be  the  slave  of  Raghava,  that 
invincible,  loyal,  courageous  and  illustrious  warrior  !  * 

"  Thus  addressed  in  harsh  terms,  Dashagriva  blazed  up 
with  wrath  like  a  fire  on  to  which  a  brand  has  been  cast  and, 
rolling  his  eyes  in  rage,  clenching  his  right  fist  he  prepared 
to  strike  Mithila's  daughter. 

"  Then  all  the  titan  women  cried  out :  *  Hold  !  Hold !  * 
and  from  their  midst,  the  wife  of  that  evil  wretch,  the  lovely 
Mandodari,  ran  towards  him  and  with  gentle  words,  inspired 
by  the  love  she  bore  him,  contrived  to  pacify  him. 

"  She  said  : — *  Thou  whose  valour  is  equal  to  Mahendra's, 
what  need  hast  thou  for  Sita  ?  Divert  thyself  with  me,  who 
am  in  no  way  inferior  to  her  or  do  thou  disport  thyself  with  the 
daughters  of  the  Gods,  the  Gandharvas  or  Yakshas.  What  is 
Sita  to  thee  ?  ' 

"  Thereafter,  that  company  of  women  raised  up  that  powerful 
Ranger  of  the  Night  and  conducted  him  back  to  his  residence. 

"  Ravana  having  departed,  those  titan  women  of  hideous 
aspect,  railed  at  Sita  in  harsh  and  cruel  terms,  but  Janaki  paid 
479 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

no  more  heed  to  their  speech  than  to  a  straw,  and  their  taunts 
were  lost  on  her;  and  those  titan  women,  who  fed  on  flesh, 
failing  in  their  attempts,  informed  Ravana  of  Sita's  unconquer- 
able resolution,  whilst  others,  tired  of  tormenting  her,  giving 
up  hope,  exhausted,  lay  down  to  rest. 

"  And  while  they  slept,  Sita,  devoted  to  her  lord,  gave  voice 
to  bitter  lamentation  in  the  extremity  of  her  distress. 
"  Thereafter,  rising  in  their  midst,  Trijata  spoke,  saying : — 
"  *  Devour  me  this  instant,  if  you  will,  but  do  not  lay  hands 
on  the  dark-eyed  Sita,  daughter  of  Janaka,  the  virtuous 
daughter-in-law  of  King  Dasaratha.  In  truth  I  have  had  a 
fearful  dream,  causing  the  hair  to  stand  on  end,  presaging  the 
destruction  of  the  titans  and  the  triumph  of  this  one's  lord. 
It  is  for  us  to  seek  the  grace  of  Vaidehi,  who  alone  I  deem, 
can  defend  us  from  Raghava.  Let  us  therefore  relate  this 
dream  to  her,  for  one  who  is  the  object  of  such  a  vision,  being 
freed  from  her  distress,  will  attain  the  height  of  felicity.  By 
bowing  low  in  submission,  we  shall  earn  the  favour  of  Janaki, 
who  alone  can  deliver  us  from  this  great  peril !  * 

"  Thereat  that  chaste  and  youthful  woman,  on  hearing  of  the 
coming  victory  of  her  lord,  rejoicing,  said : — 
"  *  If  Trijata  speak  truly,  then  indeed  will  I  protect  you  all.* 
"  Observing  Sita's  unfortunate  plight,  I  became  absorbed  in 
thought  and  my  mind  was  perturbed.  Then  I  cast  about  as 
to  how  I  might  find  some  means  of  speaking  to  Janaki  and  I 
began  to  extol  the  race  of  Ikshwaku. 

"  Hearing  the  words  I  uttered  embellished  with  the  praises 
of  those  Rajarishis,  that  exalted  lady,  her  eyes  suffused  with 
tears,  enquired  of  me  saying : — *  Who  art  thou ;  how  and  on 
whose  behest  hast  thou  come  hither?  From  whence  comes 
thine  attachment  to  Rama?  It  behoveth  thee  to  relate  all 
to  me.* 

"Listening  to  her  speech,  I  made  answer  to  her  in  this 
wise: — 

" '  O  Goddess !  Rama,  thy  consort,  hath  found  an  ally 
endowed  with  supreme  prowess,  named  Sugriva,  who  is  the 
redoubtable  and  powerful  King  of  the  Monkeys.  Know  me 
to  be  bis  servant,  Hanuman,  who  has  come  hither  to  thee, 
dispatched  by  thy  lord  of  imperishable  exploits.  0  Illustrious 
480 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Lady,  that  highly  effulgent  son  of  Dasaratha,  foremost  of  men, 
hath  sent  this  ring  as  a  token  to  thee.  O  Queen,  what  is  thy 
behest  ?  Shall  I  bring  thee  back  to  Rama  and  Lakshmana  on 
the  northern  shore  of  the  ocean  ? ' 

"  Hearing  this,  Sita,  the  delight  of  Janaka,  reflected  within 
herself  awhile  and  said  : — 

"  '  Suffer  Raghava  to  destroy  Ravana  and  himself  carry  me 
hence.'  Inclining  my  head  to  that  noble  and  irreproachable 
lady,  I  requested  some  token  from  her  which  might  enhance 
the  delight  of  Raghava,  whereupon  Sita  said  to  me : — 

" '  Take  this  excellent  jewel  for  which  thou  shalt  be  highly 
regarded  by  that  One  of  mighty  arras.' 

*'  Thereupon,  that  princess  of  lovely  limbs  gave  me  a  mar- 
vellous jewel  and  in  a  voice  strangled  with  sobs,  bade  me  fare- 
well. I  bowed  to  that  daughter  of  a  king  with  deep  respect  and, 
circumambulating  her  began  to  consider  returning  home,  but  she, 
having  searched  her  heart,  addressed  me  once  again,  saying : — 

"  '  O  Hanuman,  do  thou  relate  my  story  to  Raghava  in  such 
wise  that  those  two  heroes,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  will  come 
here  instantly  accompanied  by  Sugriva,  or  else,  having  but 
two  months  to  live,  Kakutstha  will  see  me  no  more,  like  one 
without  a  protector.' 

"  Hearing  these  dreadful  words,  a  wave  of  anger  surged  over 
me  and  I  instantly  resolved  on  what  I  should  do.  Thereupon, 
expanding  my  body  to  the  size  of  a  mountain,  burning  to  fight, 
I  laid  waste  the  grove.  Then  all  the  beasts  and  birds  began 
to  flee  away  in  fear  and  those  terrible  titan  women  awoke  and 
beheld  the  devastation.  Observing  me,  they  all  assembled  and 
instantly  ran  in  haste  to  inform  Ravana,  saying : — 

"  *  O  Valiant  Sovereign,  this  thine  inviolable  grove  has  been 
destroyed  by  a  wretched  monkey  who  sets  thy  prowess  at 
nought.  Slay  that  perverse  creature  instantly,  who  thus 
affronts  thee,  lest  he  escape !  * 

"  On  this,  the  King  of  the  Titans,  Ravana,  sent  out  in- 
numerable warriors  called  Kinkaras  and  eighty  thousand  of 
those  titans,  armed  with  spears  and  maces,  were  slain  by  me 
in  the  grove  with  an  iron  bar.  Then  a  few,  who  survived, 
quickly  went  to  Ravana  to  inform  him  of  the  destruction  of 
his  troops. 

481 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"Thereupon  I  resolved  to  destroy  the  marvellous  palace 
with  its  monument  and  slew  the  guards  stationed  there.  In 
my  fury  I  laid  this  building,  the  ornament  of  Lanka,  low, 
whereupon  Ravana  sent  out  the  son  of  Prahasta,  Jambumalin 
with  a  company  of  titans  of  grim  and  fearful  aspect. 

"  With  my  formidable  mace  I  slew  that  mighty  and  skilful 
warrior  with  his  retinue  and  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans, 
on  hearing  this,  dispatched  the  highly  powerful  sons  of  the 
ministers  followed  by  a  regiment  of  infantry  but  with  my  iron 
bar  I  sent  them  all  to  the  abode  of  death. 

"  Learning  that,  despite  their  ardour,  I  had  struck  down 
the  sons  of  his  ministers  on  the  field,  Ravana  quickly  ordered 
five  of  his  heroic  commanders  to  set  out  at  the  head  of  their 
troops,  but  I  slew  them  all,  whereupon  Dashagriva  sent  out 
his  highly  powerful  son,  Aksha,  with  countless  titans,  to  engage 
me  in  combat.  Then  that  youthful  son  of  Mandodari,  a 
skilful  warrior  sprang  into  the  air  and  I  seized  him  by  the 
feet,  whirling  him  round  and  throwing  him  on  the  earth. 

"  Thereat  the  ten-necked  Ravana,  full  of  ire,  hearing  of  the 
downfall  of  Aksha,  sent  his  second  son  Indrajit,  full  of  courage 
and  martial  ardour,  against  me  and  I,  rendering  the  prowess 
of  all  those  titans  ineffectual,  experienced  extreme  delight. 
Nevertheless,  that  long-armed  warrior  in  whom  Ravana 
had  supreme  confidence,  inflamed  with  wine,  continued  to 
fight  at  the  head  of  his  warriors. 

"  And  he,  realising  that  I  was  invincible  and  seeing  his 
forces  routed,  made  me  captive  by  aid  of  the  Brahma-weapon, 
whereupon  the  titans  bound  me  with  ropes  and  taking  hold  of 
me  brought  me  before  Ravana.  Then  that  One  of  vicious  soul 
entered  into  conversation  with  me  and  enquired  of  me  regarding 
my  coming  to  Lanka  and  why  I  had  slain  the  titans,  whereto 
I  replied : — 

" '  I  have  done  all  this  for  Sita  !  To  find  her  I  came  hither ! 
I  am  the  son  of  Maruta,  the  monkey  Hanuman !  Know  me 
to  be  Rama's  messenger  and  the  minister  of  Sugriva.  It  is  to 
carry  out  Rama's  design  that  I  stand  before  thee !  Hear  me 
now  O  Lord  of  the  Titans  !  The  King  of  the  Monkeys  offers 
thee  salutations  and  enquires  as  to  thy  welfare,  O  Mighty 
Hero !  He  has  commissioned  me  to  communicate  this  message 
482 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

in  words  that  are  both  fitting  and  in  accord  with  duty,  legitimate 
pleasure  and  profit. 

"  '  While  sojourning  on  Rishyamuka,  that  mountain  covered 
with  trees,  I  entered  into  an  alliance  with  Raghava,  that  great 
warrior,  invincible  in  combat,  and  he  spoke  to  me  saying : — 
'  O  King,  my  consort  has  been  borne  away  by  a  titan ;  it 
behoves  thee  to  assist  me  in  this  matter ! '  Thereafter,  in  the 
presence  of  fire,  the  Lord,  Raghava,  who  was  accompanied 
by  Lakshmana,  allied  himself  to  me  in  friendship,  who  had 
been  deprived  of  my  royal  prerogatives  by  Bali. 

"  *  And  he  hath  made  me  lord  over  all  the  monkeys,  after 
slaying  Bali  in  combat  with  a  single  arrow.  It  is  therefore 
fitting  that  we  should  assist  him  by  every  means  and  by  virtue 
of  this  contract  I  have  despatched  Hanuman  unto  thee  as  envoy. 
Do  thou  therefore  speedily  return  Sita  to  Rama,  ere  those 
valiant  monkeys  overthrow  thy  forces.  Who  is  not  conversant 
with  the  monkeys'  prowess,  whose  aid  has  been  solicited 
even  by  the  Gods  themselves  ? ' 

"  Speaking  thus  to  Ravana,  he  bent  his  furious  glances  on 
me  as  if  he  would  consume  me  and  that  ruthless  titan  ordered 
me  to  be  put  to  death,  being  unaware  of  my  power. 

"  Meanwhile  his  high-souled  brother  Bibishana,  endowed 
with  great  sagacity,  interceded  for  me  in  the  following  wise; 
saying :  *  O  Thou  Foremost  of  the  Titans,  abandon  thy  resolve, 
which  is  not  in  accord  with  the  royal  code.  The  death  of  an 
envoy  is  not  sanctioned  by  royal  tradition,  O  Titan.  A 
messenger  simply  communicates  the  mandate  of  his  master ! 
O  Thou  of  incomparable  prowess,  there  is  no  warranty  for 
his  destructon,  yet,  if  his  guilt  be  considerable,  he  may  be 
mutilated.' 

"  At  these  words  of  Bibishana,  Ravana  issued  this  command 
to  the  demons :  '  Set  fire  to  the  monkey's  tail ! ' 

"  On  this  behest,  those  titans  wrapped  my  tail  in  hemp  and 
cotton  rags  and  they,  in  well-wrought  armour  struck  me  with 
their  clenched  fists  and  sticks  and  set  fire  to  my  tail.  Bound 
and  fettered  with  ropes  by  the  titans,  I  submitted  to  it,  resolving 
to  set  fire  to  the  city.  Thus  pinioned  and  enveloped  in  flames, 
those  warriors,  shouting,  led  me  along  the  royal  highway  to  the 
gates  of  the  city.  There,  contracting  my  body  I  assumed  a 
483  21 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

diminutive  form  and  casting  off  my  bonds,  I  seized  an  iron 
bar  and  assailed  those  titans,  thereafter  with  one  bound  vault- 
ing the  gate,  I  rapidly  burnt  down  the  whole  city  and  its  gates 
and  towers  with  my  flaming  tail,  resembling  the  fire  that  con- 
sumes all  beings  at  the  end  of  the  world. 

"  Seeing  Lanka  in  flames  I  reflected  with  anxiety  that  Janaki 
must  without  doubt  have  perished  since  there  was  no  corner 
of  the  city  that  had  not  been  reduced  to  ashes.  Thinking  thus, 
overcome  with  grief,  1  overheard  the  Charanas  saying  in 
auspicious  accents : — 

"  '  Janaki  has  not  perished  in  the  flames  ! '  and  hearing  these 
wonderful  words,  proclaimed  by  their  enchanting  voices,  I 
regained  my  courage.  I  was  thereafter  reassured  by  many 
auspicious  signs,  that  Janaki  had  been  saved  from  the  flames 
and  though  my  tail  was  on  fire,  I  had  not  been  consumed ! 
My  heart  was  filled  with  joy  and  the  wind  spread  its  delicious 
perfumes.  By  virtue  of  these  propitious  manifestations,  by 
my  confidence  in  Rama's  prowess  and  in  Sita  and  the  words 
pronounced  by  the  great  sages,  felicity  filled  my  soul.  Then, 
re-visiting  Vaidehi  once  again,  I  took  leave  of  her  and,  scaling 
the  Mount  Arishta,  leapt  in  this  direction  in  order  to  see  you 
all  once  more.  Following  the  path  of  the  wind,  sun,  moon 
and  the  Siddhas  and  Gandharvas,  I  found  you  here. 

"  By  the  grace  of  Rama  and  your  prowess,  I  have  carried 
out  Sugriva's  charge  to  the  uttermost.  I  have  related  all  to 
you  in  detail  and  it  now  remains  for  you  to  accomplish  what 
is  still  to  be  done." 


chapter   59 

Hanuman  appeals  to  the  Monkeys  to  rescue  Sita 

Having  completed  his  narrative,  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta, 
added  these  significant  words: — "Fruitful  have  been  the 
endeavours  of  Rama  and  Sugriva !  Having  witnessed  Sita's 
constancy,  I  am  happy  at  heart !  By  the  power  of  her  penances, 
the  most  illustrious  Sita  is  able  to  uphold  the  earth  or  consume 
it  with  her  ire,  0  Monkeys.  The  power  of  Ravana  also, 
484 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

created  by  austerities,  is  great  and  it  is  because  of  this  that 
he  was  not  destroyed  when  he  laid  hands  on  Sita.  Nay,  the 
flame  to  which  one  reaches  out  is  not  so  greatly  to  be  feared  as 
is  Sita's  wrath. 

"  It  now  behoveth  all  the  mighty  monkeys  and  others, 
with  Jambavan  at  their  head  to  take  part  in  this  expedition,  the 
purpose  of  which  is  now  known  to  you,  in  order  to  behold 
Vaidehi  re-united  with  those  two  princes. 

"  Alone  I  was  able  to  enter  Lanka,  inhabited  by  titans  and 
have  afflicted  that  city  by  my  prowess,  as  also  Ravana  and  his 
people.  What  more  could  I  not  do  therefore  with  the  coura- 
geous and  powerful  Plavagas,  endowed  with  heroism  and 
martial  prowess,  strong  and  eager  for  victory  ? 

"  I  shall  destroy  Ravana  with  his  entire  army,  his  sons, 
brothers  and  followers  in  combat.  I  shall  destroy  all  the 
titans  and  circumvent  those  invisible  weapons  and  other  missiles, 
bestowed  on  Indrajita  by  Brahma,  Rudra,  Vayu,  Varuna, 
scattering  them  and  slaying  the  titans ;  with  your  sanction  my 
prowess  will  bring  them  under  restraint.  Hills  and  moun- 
tains torn  up  by  me  will  I  discharge  continuously,  which 
even  the  Gods  themselves  cannot  withstand,  how  much  less 
those  rangers  of  the  night  ?  Were  the  sea  to  overflow  or 
Mount  Mandara  move  from  its  place,  Jambavan  will  never  be 
daunted  by  an  enemy  host  in  conflict.  And  that  heroic  monkey, 
the  son  of  Bali,  is  alone  able  to  destroy  the  entire  host  of 
Rakshasas.  With  the  movement  of  his  vigorous  thighs,  the 
powerful  Nila  could  overthrow  Mount  Mandara  itself,  how 
much  more  the  titans  on  the  field  of  battle.  Amongst  the 
Celestials,  the  Titans,  Yakshas,  Gandharvas,  serpents  or  birds, 
show  me  any  who  could  withstand  Dvivida  ?  Nor  do  I  know 
any  who  could  resist  those  two  sons  of  the  Ashwins,  endowed 
with  supreme  energy,  the  foremost  of  monkeys,  in  the  arena. 
"  Single-handed  I  have  laid  Lanka  low  and,  setting  it  on 
fire  have  reduced  it  to  ashes.  On  every  highway  I  proclaimed 
aloud :  *  May  Victory  crown  the  invincible  Rama  and  Laksh- 
mana !  May  the  King  Sugriva,  whose  support  is  Raghava, 
prosper.  I  am  the  servant  of  the  King  of  Koshala,  the  off- 
spring of  Pavana  !  I  am  Hanuman  ! '  I  have  announced  this 
everywhere. 

485 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  In  the  centre  of  the  Ashoka  grove  of  the  vicious-souled 
Ravana,  the  virtuous  Sita  waits  forlornly  at  the  foot  of  the 
Shimshapa  tree  surrounded  by  titan  women,  emaciated  with 
sorrow  and  suffering,  resembling  the  orb  of  the  moon  bereft 
of  its  splendour  in  the  midst  of  cloud.  Spurning  Ravana, 
whose  powers  have  rendered  him  arrogant,  Vaidehi,  the 
daughter  of  Janaka  of  fair  limbs,  remains  undeviatingly  faithful 
to  her  lord.  Wholly  devoted  to  Rama,  the  lovely  Vaidehi, 
thinks  of  him  alone,  as  Poulomi,  Purandara.  Clad  in  a  single 
garment,  soiled  with  dust,  I  beheld  her  in  the  grove  surrounded 
by  titan  women  who  were  heaping  insults  upon  her.  Her  hair, 
dressed  in  a  single  braid  that  unfortunate  being  was  absorbed 
in  the  thought  of  her  lord.  Lying  on  the  earth,  pale  as  a  lotus 
at  the  approach  of  winter,  separated  by  Ravana  from  the 
object  of  her  love,  she  had  resolved  to  yield  up  her  life. 

"  With  difficulty  I  was  able  to  re-kindle  Sita's  hopes  by 
addressing  that  damsel,  whose  eyes  resemble  a  doe's,  and 
relating  all  to  her.  And  she,  hearing  of  the  alliance  between 
Rama  and  Sugriva  became  happy  and,  fixed  in  her  devotion, 
her  conjugal  affection  reached  its  zenith.  Fortunate  is  that 
ten-necked  demon  that  she  has  not  destroyed  him,  due  to 
the  boon  he  received  from  Brahma ;  but  it  is  for  Rama  that 
the  destruction  of  that  monster  is  reserved. 

"  Already  greatly  reduced,  Janaki  grows  frailer  every  day, 
in  Rama's  absence,  as  learning  wanes  that  is  prosecuted  on 
the  first  day  of  the  lunar  fortnight. 

"  Thus  liveth  Sita  worn  out  by  grief !  It  is  for  you  to  take 
counsel  as  to  what  it  is  proper  to  do  in  the  matter." 


CHAPTER    60 
Janibavan  rejects  Angada's  Project 

Hearing  these  words,  the  son  of  Bali,  Angada,  said : — 

"  The  sons  of  the  Ashwins  are  exceedingly  powerful  and 
proud  of  the  boon  conferred  on  them  by  the  Grandsire  of  the 
World,  who  in  order  to  honour  the  Ashwi  rendered  those  two 
monkeys  incapable  of  being  slain  by  any.  This  unique 
privilege  inflamed  their  pride  and  those  two  powerful  warriors, 
486 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

having  overcome  the  mighty  celestial  host,  drank  up  the 
nectar  of  immortality.  These  two,  inflamed  with  ire,  are  able 
to  destroy  the  entire  city  of  Lanka  with  its  horses,  chariots  and 
elephants,  what  of  other  monkeys  ?  I  myself  am  capable  of 
destroying  the  city  with  its  titans  and  the  mighty  Ravana  ! 
How  much  more  so  if  I  am  accompanied  by  powerful  warriors, 
masters  of  themselves,  well-armed,  skilful  and  desirous  of  victory? 

"  We  have  heard  that  the  courageous  son  of  Vayu  alone  set 
fire  to  Lanka.  He  has  seen  the  divine  Sita  but  has  not  brought 
her  back.  I  deem  it  unfitting  that  warriors  as  renowned  as 
you  are  acquaint  Rama  of  this.  There  are  none  in  leaping 
and  in  prowess,  whose  skill  and  bravery  equal  yours  in  the 
worlds  of  the  Immortals  or  amongst  the  Daityas,  O  Foremost 
of  Monkeys.  Few  have  escaped  the  carnage  wrought  by 
Hanuman,  therefore  it  only  remains  for  us  to  slay  Ravana 
and  the  rest  of  the  titans  and  bring  back  the  daughter  of  Janaka, 
placing  her  between  Rama  and  Lakshmana !  What  need  have 
we  to  trouble  those  other  residents  of  Kishkindha  ?  It  is  for 
us  to  proceed  to  Lanka  and,  having  slain  the  titans,  return  to 
Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sugriva." 

Such  was  the  project  of  Angada,  whereupon  Jambavan,  the 
foremost  of  monkeys,  in  his  wisdom,  cheerfully  made  answer 
in  words  fraught  with  good  sense,  saying : — 

"  O  Great  Monkey,  O  Thou  of  supreme  understanding,  we 
have  received  a  mandate  from  the  King  of  the  Monkeys  and  the 
virtuous  Rama  to  explore  the  southern  region  to  its  utmost 
confines,  but  we  have  not  been  commanded  to  bring  back 
Sita  nor  would  it  find  favour  with  that  lion  among  monarchs, 
Rama,  if  we  did  so,  for  he,  proud  of  his  lineage,  has  vowed 
before  all  the  leading  monkeys  that  he  will  himself  deliver  her. 
How  should  his  words  be  rendered  null  and  void  ?  What  is 
the  use  of  undertaking  that  which  is  not  conducive  to  his 
pleasure?  This  display  of  our  prowess  will  prove  fruitless, 
O  Foremost  of  Monkeys !  Let  us  therefore  return  to  where 
Rama,  with  Lakshmana  and  the  illustrious  Sugriva  can  be 
found  and  inform  them  of  the  result  of  our  quest. 

What  thou  hast  proposed  finds  favour  with  us,  O  Prince, 
yet  it  is  by  adhering  to  Rama's  design  that  thou  shouldst  look 
for  success." 

487 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    6  I 

The  Devastation  of  Madhuvana 

All  the  heroic  monkeys  headed  by  Angada  and  the  great  ape 
Hanuman  highly  approved  Jambavan's  words  and,  those 
foremost  of  monkeys  led  by  the  son  of  Vayu  leaping  down 
from  the  summit  of  the  Mahendra  Mountain,  bounded  forward. 
Resembling  the  mountains  Meru  and  Mandara,  they  appeared 
like  elephants  maddened  with  ichor,  covering  the  whole  of 
space  as  it  were  with  their  shadow,  their  eyes  fixed  on  the 
highly  powerful  Hanuman  gifted  with  velocity,  having  control 
of  his  senses  and  honoured  by  the  Siddhas.  Resolved  on 
bringing  about  the  success  of  Rama's  design,  proud  of  the 
results  obtained,  desirous  of  communicating  their  auspicious 
tidings,  all  those  virtuous  inhabitants  of  the  forest,  eager  to 
assist  Rama  and  avid  for  combat,  jumping  and  frisking,  reached 
Madhuvana. 

And  they  came  to  that  celestial  grove  protected  by  Sugriva, 
planted  with  coundess  trees,  enchanting  to  look  upon,  where 
none  might  enter.  And  Sugriva's  maternal  uncle,  the  mighty 
monkey  Dadhimukha  guarded  that  picturesque  and  spacious 
garden  belonging  to  the  Lord  of  Monkeys.  Extremely  anxious 
to  partake  of  the  fruits  of  that  beautiful  orchard,  those  tawny- 
coloured  monkeys,  greatly  delighted,  craved  permission  of  the 
prince  to  taste  the  honey,  yellow  as  they.  Then  he  graciously 
allowed  those  venerable  monkeys,  headed  by  Jambavan,  to 
drink  of  the  honey. 

Thereupon,  under  Angada's  command,  authorised  by  that 
youthful  son  of  Bali,  those  monkeys  ascended  the  trees,  swarm- 
ing with  bees,  feasting  on  the  fruit  and  roots  and,  in  an  access 
of  intoxication,  began  to  frolic  here  and  there. 

Singing,  laughing,  dancing,  bowing,  declaiming,  running, 

capering  and  clapping  their  hands,  some  supported  others, 

some  quarrelled  and   some  talked  at  random.     Some  leapt 

from  tree  to  tree,  springing  down  from  the  highest  branches, 

488 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

some  bounded  into  the  air  or  chased  each  other  round  the  trees 
from  rock  to  rock,  responding  to  each  other's  songs  and  laughter, 
groans  and  lamentations,  exchanging  blow  for  blow. 

Then  a  general  confusion  arose  amongst  that  host  of  monkeys 
and  there  were  none  who  were  not  inebriated  or  inflamed 
with  excitement. 

Seeing  the  wood  laid  waste,  the  trees  stripped  of  their  leaves 
and  flowers,  Dadhimukha  was  filled  with  anger  and  sought  to 
restrain  them.  But  that  heroic  and  elderly  monkey,  the 
protector  of  the  wood,  was  in  turn  upbraided  by  those  insolent 
monkeys  whereupon  he  grew  even  more  determined  to  defend 
the  forest  that  was  entrusted  to  his  care  against  them.  There- 
after he  spoke  to  some  in  harsh  terms  without  fear  or  fore- 
thought and  struck  others  with  the  palm  of  his  hands,  approach- 
ing some  threateningly  and  others  with  soothing  words. 

They,  however,  excited  with  liquor,  restrained  by  Dadhi- 
mukha, began  to  ill-treat  him  brazenly  without  reflecting  that 
the  fault  lay  with  them,  scratching  him  with  their  nails, 
biting  him  with  their  teeth,  assailing  him  with  blows  of  their 
hands  and  feet,  and  knocking  him  senseless  laid  waste  to  the 
whole  of  Madhuvana. 


CHAPTER    62 

The  Fight  between  Dadhimukha  and  the  Intruders 

Then  Hanuman  said  to  those  monkeys  :  "  O  Monkeys,  gather 
honey  undisturbed  !  I  will  drive  away  anyone  who  hinders 
you ! " 

Hearing  these  words,  Angada,  that  prince  of  monkeys,  gaily 
echoed  his  advice,  saying :  "  Do  you  all  drink  honey.  We 
should  be  guided  by  all  that  Hanuman  does,  who  has  accom- 
plished his  purpose ;  even  if  it  be  improper,  I  am  in  accord 
with  it ! " 

Listening  to  Angada,  those  foremost  of  monkeys  all  cried 
out : — "  Excellent !  Excellent !  ",  praising  the  prince  again  and 
again.  Thereafter  they  surged  into  the  Malin  wood  with  the 
489 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

violence  of  a  torrent  and,  having  penetrated  into  those  orchards, 
they  drove  away  the  guards  by  force.  Happy  in  the  thought 
that  Hanuman  had  discovered  Maithili  and  having  had  tidings 
of  her,  with  the  consent  of  Angada  they  drank  the  honey  and 
feasted  on  the  fruits. 

Hurling  themselves  on  the  guardians  of  that  orchard  who 
approached  them  in  hundreds,  they  overwhelmed  them  with 
blows  and  beat  them  off.  Collecting  honeycombs,  a  drona  in 
size  with  their  hands,  those  monkeys,  yellow  as  honey  them- 
selves, drank  the  nectar  and  threw  away  the  combs ;  some  in 
frolic  pelted  each  other  with  wax  or  piling  up  the  branches 
sat  down  under  the  trees ;  some,  heavy  with  drink,  heaped 
leaves  on  the  earth  and  lay  down  exhausted  whilst  others, 
stimulated  by  the  intoxicating  nectar,  reeling,  struck  out  at  their 
companions  wildly.  Singing  at  the  top  of  their  voices,  some 
imitated  the  roar  of  lions  and  some  whistled  like  birds,  others, 
drunk  with  honey,  slept  on  the  ground ;  some  roared  with 
laughter  or  burst  into  tears,  some  babbled  wildly  whilst  others 
tried  to  interpret  their  utterances. 

Meanwhile  the  guards  of  the  forest,  the  servants  of  Dadhi- 
mukha,  set  upon  by  those  terrible  monkeys,  crushed 
between  their  knees,  fled  in  all  directions.  Wrought  up  with 
fear,  they  approached  Dadhimukha  and  said : — "  Empowered 
by  Hanuman,  those  terrible  monkeys  have,  despite  us,  laid 
waste  to  Madhuvana  and,  crushed  between  their  knees,  we 
all  but  gave  up  our  lives." 

Highly  incensed,  Dadhimukha,  beholding  the  destruction  in 
the  Madhu  Wood,  which  had  been  entrusted  to  his  guards, 
consoled  his  subordinates,  saying : — "  Proceed  to  that  place 
and  fall  upon  those  insolent  monkeys;  I  myself  shall  soon  follow 
and  drive  away  by  force  those  who  are  drinking  the  honey." 
Hearing  the  words  of  their  master,  those  valiant  monkeys 
returned  to  Madhuvana  and  Dadhimukha,  in  their  midst, 
accompanied  them  with  great  speed,  bearing  huge  trees. 
Arming  themselves  with  rocks,  trees  and  stones,  all  those 
monkeys,  highly  incensed,  proceeded  to  where  the  Plavam- 
gamas  were  to  be  found,  where,  biting  their  lips  in  anger, 
they  remonstrated  with  them  again  and  again,  seeking  to 
suppress  them  by  force. 

490 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Then  all  those  monkeys,  headed  by  Hanuman,  beholding 
Dadhimukha  greatly  enraged,  drove  him  back  with  violence 
and,  as  the  mighty  Dadhimukha  of  huge  arms  advanced  bearing 
a  tree  in  his  hands,  the  powerful  Angada  incensed,  intercepted 
him  with  his  hands  and,  beside  himself  with  inebriation, 
without  showing  the  least  mercy,  though  he  merited  it  being 
his  great-uncle,  threw  him  to  the  ground  with  violence.  Then 
that  monkey,  his  arms  and  thighs  broken  and  his  face  mutilated, 
bathed  in  blood,  fell  senseless  for  a  space,  thereafter,  dis- 
engaging himself  with  difficulty,  that  foremost  of  monkeys 
withdrew  to  a  distance  and  addressed  his  attendants,  saying : — 

"  Let  us  all  proceed  with  haste  to  where  the  thick-necked 
Sugriva,  resides  with  Rama.  I  shall  relate  all  Prince 
Angada's  misdeeds  to  him  and  filled  with  ire  that  Sovereign 
will  punish  all  the  monkeys.  The  enchanting  Madhu  Wood, 
enjoyed  by  his  forefathers,  inviolate  even  to  the  Gods,  is 
greatly  beloved  by  Sugriva  and  he  will  mete  out  heavy  punish- 
ment to  those  perverse  wretches  avid  for  honey  and  will  slay 
those  who  have  disobeyed  their  sovereign,  with  their  friends 
and  kinsfolk.  Then  shall  my  wrath,  which  I  am  unable  to 
restrain,  be  appeased." 

Speaking  thus  to  the  guards  of  the  forest,  Dadhimukha, 
their  leader,  departed  with  them  with  all  speed  and  in  the 
twinkling  of  an  eye,  reached  the  place  where  that  sagacious 
offspring  of  the  Sun,  Sugriva,  was. 

Beholding  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sugriva,  that  great  and 
heroic  monkey,  Dadhimukha,  descending  from  the  sky,  alighted 
on  the  ground  and  with  a  sorrowful  mien  placing  his  joined 
palms  to  his  forehead,  touched  Sugriva's  feet. 


CHAPTER    63 

Dadhimukha  relates  how  Madhuvana  has  been  hid  waste 

Seeing  that  monkey  prostrating  himself,  his  forehead  touching 
the  earth,  Sugriva,  his  heart  moved,  said  to  him : — 

"  Rise,  Rise !    Why  art  thou  lying  prostrate  at  my  feet  ? 
Speak  without  fear  !  Why  hast  thou  come  hither  ?  It  behoveth 
491 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALM1KI 

thee  to  make  thy  purpose  plain.    Is  all  well  in  Madhuvana  ? 
I  wish  to  know  everything,  O  Monkey  !  " 

Thus  reassured  by  the  magnanimous  Sugriva,  the  highly 
sagacious  Dadhimukha  rose  and  spoke  as  follows : — 

"  O  Lord,  that  wood  which  neither  thou  nor  Bali  suffered 
to  be  enjoyed  by  the  monkeys,  has  been  laid  waste  by  them  1 
Seeking  to  drive  them  away  with  my  attendants,  they,  dis- 
regarding me,  continued  to  feast  there  merrily.  I  resisted  their 
depredations  with  the  assistance  of  my  guards,  but  without 
showing  any  consideration  for  me,  O  Prince,  those  savages 
continued  their  orgy.  These  attendants  of  mine,  assaulted 
by  them,  were  driven  from  the  wood  and  those  countless 
powerful  monkeys,  their  eyes  inflamed  with  anger,  broke  their 
arms  and  feet  and,  crushing  them  between  their  thighs,  flung 
them  into  the  air.  Thou  art  the  living  lord  of  these  warriors 
who  have  been  assaulted  by  those  monkeys,  who  even  now 
are  pillaging  Madhuvana  and  quaffing  the  honey." 

While  Sugriva  listened  to  these  tidings,  the  sagacious  Laksh- 
mana,  Slayer  of  his  Foes,  enquired  of  him  saying  : — "  O  King, 
who  is  this  monkey,  the  guard  over  the  forest  who  has  come 
to  thee  and  what  distress  has  led  him  to  speak  thus  ?  " 

Being  thus  addressed  by  the  high-souled  Lakshmana, 
Sugriva,  skilled  in  converse,  answered  : — 

"  O  Noble  Lakshmana,  this  is  Dadhimukha  and  this  heroic 
monkey  informs  me  that  those  war-like  forest  dwellers  led  by 
Angada  have  drunk  the  honey  and  eaten  the  fruits  of  the 
orchard.  Such  an  escapade  would  not  have  been  indulged  in 
by  those  who  had  failed  in  their  mission.  Assuredly  they  have 
been  successful  since  they  have  devastated  the  wood.  It  is  for 
this  reason  that  they  have  beaten  with  their  knees  those  who 
have  obstructed  their  revelry  and  have  disregarded  the  valiant 
Dadhimukha  whom  I  myself  appointed  as  guardian  to  my 
orchard.  In  sooth,  Hanuman  and  none  other  must  have 
discovered  the  divine  Sita.  Hanuman  alone  could  accom- 
plish such  a  feat.  The  success  of  that  enterprise  depended  on 
the  sagacity  of  that  foremost  of  monkeys  endowed  with 
courage,  strength  and  learning.  Where  Jambavan  and 
Angada  are  the  leaders  and  Hanuman  the  moving  spirit, 
success  is  assured.  Assuredly  Madhuvana  has  been  laid 
492 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

waste  by  those  heroic  monkeys  led  by  Angada.  Having 
explored  the  southern  region,  on  their  return  this  orch- 
ard excited  their  cupidity,  whereupon  they  plundered  it 
and  drank  the  honey,  assaulting  the  guards  and  beating  them 
with  their  knees.  This  monkey,  the  gentle-voiced  Dadhi- 
mukha,  renowned  for  his  prowess  has  come  to  communicate 
these  tidings  to  me.  O  Mighty  Saumitri,  undoubtedly  Sita 
must  have  been  found  else  these  monkeys  would  never  have 
destroyed  the  wood  bestowed  on  us  by  the  Gods." 

Hearing  these  words  pleasant  to  the  ear  falling  from 
Sugriva's  lips,  the  virtuous  Lakshmana  and  Raghava  were 
overcome  with  joy  and  the  illustrious  Sugriva,  exultant  on 
receiving  these  tidings  from  Dadhimukha,  answered  that 
guardian  of  the  forest,  saying : — 

"  Highly  gratified  am  I  that  those  warriors,  being  successful, 
have  eaten  the  honey  and  fruit !  One  should  bear  with  the 
arrogance  of  those  who  have  been  victorious.  Return  to  the 
Madhu  Wood  immediately  and  send  all  those  monkeys  with 
Hanuman  at  their  head,  here !  With  these  two  descendants 
of  Raghu,  I  wish  to  interrogate  those  deer  of  the  branches 
without  delay,  who,  with  the  boldness  of  lions  have  fulfilled 
their  task,  in  order  to  learn  if  they  have  discovered  Sita." 

Beholding  those  two  princes,  their  eyes  dilated  with  joy, 
in  the  height  of  felicity,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  realising  the 
success  of  his  enterprise  was  near,  experienced  extreme 
satisfaction. 


CHAPTER    64 

Sugrwa  consoles  Rama 

Thus  addressed  by  Sugriva,  the  monkey  Dadhimukha  cheer- 
fully offered  obeisance  to  him  and  gave  salutations  to  Raghava 
and  Lakshmana.  Thereafter,  having  honoured  Sugriva  and 
those  powerful  sons  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  escorted  by  his 
attendants,  he  sprang  into  the  air.  Departing  with  the 
same  speed  by  which  he  had  come,  he  descended  from  the 
493 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

sky  and,  alighting  on  the  earth,  entered  the  Madhu  wood. 
There  he  beheld  those  foremost  of  monkeys,  now  sober, 
spending  the  hours  happily,  having  relieved  themselves,  the 
outcome  of  drinking  honey,  and  approaching  them,  that 
hero  with  joined  palms  addressed  Angada  in  the  following 
words : — 

"  O  Noble  Prince,  do  not  harbour  any  ill-feeling  towards  the 
guards,  who,  enraged,  sought  to  drive  thee  away  by  force. 
May  peace  attend  thee !  O  Thou  of  great  strength,  do  thou 
partake  of  the  honey  freely  which  is  thine  by  right,  since  thou 
art  the  heir-apparent  and  owner  of  the  wood.  It  behoveth 
thee  to  pardon  us  for  our  wrath,  arising  out  of  ignorance ! 
Like  unto  thy  sire  formerly  and  Sugriva,  so  art  thou  Lord  of 
the  monkey  host !  O  Irreproachable  Prince,  I  have  related  all 
unto  thine  uncle,  who,  hearing  of  the  presence  of  the  monkeys 
here,  of  thine  arrival  and  also  of  the  devastation  of  the  forest, 
was  not  the  least  incensed,  rather  was  he  gratified.  Highly 
pleased,  thy  paternal  uncle,  Sugriva,  King  of  the  Monkeys, 
said  :   '  Send  them  all  here  without  delay  ! '  " 

Hearing  those  words  of  Dadhimukha,  Angada,  Prince  of  the 
Monkeys,  skilled  in  speech,  addressed  all  his  companions, 
saying : — 

"  O  You  Leaders  of  the  Monkey  Host,  undoubtedly  all  these 
events  have  been  related  to  Rama.  This  may  be  inferred  by 
Dadhimukha's  tidings.  It  does  not  behove  us  to  linger  here 
further,  our  mission  having  been  accomplished,  O  Slayers  of 
your  Foes !  You  have  all  drunk  honey  in  full  measure,  O  Heroic 
Forest  Dwellers,  nothing  remains  for  us  but  to  rejoin  Sugriva. 
Whatever  all  of  you  counsel  me  to  do,  I  shall  put  into  effect. 
I  am  your  servant  and,  though  the  heir-apparent,  it  is  not  for 
me  to  issue  orders  to  you.  You  have  all  accomplished  your 
task;  it  would  therefore  be  unfitting  for  me  to  treat  you 
arbitrarily." 

Hearing  these  admirable  words  of  Angada,  those  monkeys, 
full  of  delight,  spoke  thus : — 

"  Who,  of  thy  status,  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  would  speak 

thus  ?    Drunk  with  power,  each  says :    '  I  am  the  leader  !  * 

None  but  thee  would  utter  words  of  such  felicity.    Thine 

humility  augurs  well  for  us.    We  are  all  ready  to  return  to 

494 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

Sugriva  the  King  of  the  Monkeys  without  delay,  but  without 
thy  word  of  command  none  among  us  is  able  to  advance  a 
single  step." 

On  this,  Angada  answered  them,  saying :— "  It  is  well, 
let  us  go !  ",  whereupon  all  those  warriors  sprang  into  the 
air  and  the  space  was  entirely  filled  as  if  by  stones  shot  from 
a  mortar. 

Preceded  by  Angada,  who  was  followed  by  Hanuman,  those 
Plavamgamas  bounded  tempestuously  into  the  air  with  a 
great  clamour,  like  clouds  driven  before  the  wind. 

Angada  having  arrived  near  to  Sugriva,  the  King  of  the 
Monkeys  addressd  the  lotus-eyed  Rama,  who  was  consumed 
with  grief,  and  said : — 

"  Be  of  good  courage  !  Rest  assured  the  divine  Sita  has  been 
found !  These  monkeys  would  not  have  returned  otherwise, 
the  time  fixed  by  me  being  already  past ;  I  infer  this  from 
Angada's  joy !  Had  the  long-armed  Angada,  the  foremost  of 
monkeys  not  been  successful,  he  would  not  have  come  back 
to  me.  If  they  had  not  succeeded  in  their  enterprise,  after 
such  an  escapade,  that  youthful  prince,  his  mind  troubled, 
would  have  appeared  dejected.  Without  having  seen  the 
daughter  of  Janaka,  they  would  not  have  dared  to  destroy 
Madhuvana  which  was  obtained  from  my  forbears  or  attacked 
that  venerable  monkey  who  guards  it.  O  Noble  Son  of 
Kaushalya,  O  Thou  fixed  in  thy  vow  and  faithful  to  thine 
obligations,  in  sooth  Hanuman  and  none  else  has  discovered 
Sita.  No  other  is  qualified  to  encompass  this  end.  O  Thou, 
the  foremost  of  the  virtuous,  the  means  to  success  are  intelli- 
gence, resolution,  valour  and  knowledge  and  Hanuman  is 
endowed  with  all  these.  Where  Jambavan  with  Angada  leads 
and  Hanuman  directs  the  work,  there  can  be  but  one  outcome. 
O  Thou  of  immeasurable  prowess,  have  no  anxiety !  Those 
dwellers  of  the  wood,  having  reached  the  height  of  insolence, 
would  not  have  entered  into  an  escapade  of  this  kind  had 
they  failed  in  their  mission.  They  have  laid  waste  Madhuvana 
and  taken  the  honey,  I  infer  therefore  that  they  have  been 
successful." 

At  that  instant,  cries  of  "  Kilakila  "  resounded  in  the  sky 
from  those  inhabitants  of  the  woods,  who,  proud  of  Hanuman's 

495 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

exploit,  were  proceeding  towards  Kishkindha,  thus  proclaim- 
ing their  trumph. 

Hearing  that  tremendous  clamour,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys, 
curling  and  uncurling  his  tail,  became  greatly  excited,  whilst 
those  monkeys,  eager  to  see  Rama,  with  Angada  at  their  head 
and  Hanuman  before  them,  drunk  with  joy,  alighted  from  the 
sky  in  front  of  their  sovereign  and  Raghava. 

Thereafter  the  mighty-armed  Hanuman,  inclining  his  head 
in  salutations,  informed  Rama  of  Sita's  physical  and  spiritual 
well-being.  And  hearing  from  Hanuman  the  auspicious 
words  sweet  as  Amrita :  "  I  have  seen  Sita ",  the  joy  of 
Rama  and  Lakshmana  was  extreme  and  Lakshmana  gazed  on 
Sugriva,  who  had  placed  the  matter  in  the  hands  of  the  son  of 
Pavana,  with  profound  respect,  whilst  Raghava,  the  destroyer 
of  his  foes,  in  extreme  felicity  looked  on  Hanuman  with  venera- 
tion. 


chapter    65 

Hanuman  tells  Rama  of  his  Meeting  with  Sita 

Having  reached  the  Mount  Prasravana  with  its  many  woods, 
Hanuman  paid  obeisance  to  the  mighty  Rama  and  Lakshmana. 
Preceded  by  the  heir-apparent,  Angada  and  bowing  to  Sugriva 
and  the  monkeys,  he  began  to  recount  the  story  of  Sita  and 
her  confinement  in  Ravana's  harem,  of  the  threats  of  the 
female  titans,  of  her  unflinching  devotion  to  Rama  and  the 
time  fixed  for  her  execution.  All  this  did  the  monkey  relate 
in  Rama's  presence.  * 

And  hearing  of  Vaidehi's  well-being,  Rama  said ; — "  O 
Monkeys,  where  is  the  illustrious  Sita  to  be  found  and  what 
are  her  feelings  towards  me  ?  Do  ye  relate  everything  unto  me !  " 

Hearing  Rama's  words,  the  monkeys  requested  Hanuman, 
conversant  with  the  matter,  to  describe  all  in  detail.  And  he, 
versed  in  the  art  of  speech,  acquiescing  in  their  desire,  in- 
clining his  head  in  salutation  to  the  divine  Sita,  turning  to  the 
south  described  his  meeting  with  her  and  bestowed  on  Rama 
496 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

the  heavenly  jewel,  blazing  in  its  own  effulgence ;  then  the 
son  of  Maruta  offered  obeisance  to  him  and  said : — 

"  Anxious  to  behold  Sita,  I  crossed  the  ocean  four  hundred 
miles  in  extent  and  after  a  time  reached  Lanka,  that  city  be- 
longing to  the  wicked  Havana  which  is  situated  on  the  southern 
shore  of  the  sea.  There  I  beheld  Sita  in  the  inner  apartments 
of  Ravana  and  there  she  dwells,  O  Rama,  centring  all  her 
thoughts  on  thee.  I  observed  her  reviled  by  hideous  titan 
women  who  are  guarding  her  in  the  grove  and  that  noble 
lady,  accustomed  by  thee  to  felicity,  is  now  stricken  with 
grief  in  thine  absence,  O  Hero.  Imprisoned  in  Havana's  inner 
apartments  under  the  strict  surveillance  of  those  female  demons, 
wearing  a  single  plait,  forlorn,  that  unfortunate  being  is 
absorbed  in  the  thought  of  thee !  Lying  on  the  earth,  emaciated, 
resembling  a  lotus  on  the  approach  of  winter,  spurning  Ravana, 
she  is  resolved  to  yield  up  her  life. 

"O  Kakutstha,  O  Guileless  Prince,  with  considerable  diffi- 
culty I  discovered  that  princess  of  whom  thou  art  in  some  sort 
the  very  soul  and,  narrating  the  glories  of  the  Ikshwaku  Race,  I 
succeeded  in  gaining  her  confidence,  whereupon  I  told  her  all. 

"  Hearing  of  the  alliance  between  thee  and  King  Sugriva, 
she  was  greatly  delighted  and  she  remains  constant  to  thee  in 
faith  and  love.  O  Foremost  of  Men,  it  was  in  this  condition 
that  I  discovered  her  engaged  in  severe  penances  with  her 
heart  fixed  on  thee.  Bestowing  this  jewel  upon  me,  she 
requested  me  to  relate  to  thee  what  happened  on  Chittrakuta 
concerning  the  crow,  O  Sagacious  One  and,  addressing  me 
thus,  she  said : — 

"  *  O  Son  of  Vayu,  do  thou  describe  all  that  thou  hast  seen 
here  to  Rama  and  present  him  with  this  jewel,  which  has 
been  preserved  by  me  with  care.  Do  thou  remind  him  of  the 
mark  traced  with  red  powder  on  my  countenance !  Say : — 
'  O  Sinless  One,  seeing  this  unique  pearl  formed  by  the 
waters  that  I  send  to  thee,  meseems  I  see  thee  before  me  and 
I  rejoice  in  the  midst  of  my  distress.  O  Son  of  Dasaratha, 
I  shall  live  but  for  a  month,  after  which,  being  in  the  power 
of  the  titans,  I  shall  die  ! '" 

"  Such  were  the  words  addressed  to  me  by  Sita  of  emaciated 
limbs,  whose  eyes  resemble  a  doe's,  imprisoned  in  Ravana's 
497 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

apartments.    I  have  related  all  faithfully  to  thee,  O  Raghava, 
now  take  counsel  in  order  to  bridge  the  ocean." 

Seeing  those  two  princes  filled  with  renewed  hope,  the  son 
of  Vayu  having  presented  the  jewel  as  a  token  of  recognition  to 
Raghava,  described  everything  to  him  from  beginning  to  end. 


CHAPTER     66 

Rama's  Grief 

At  these  words  of  Hanuman,  Rama,  born  of  Dasaratha,  press- 
ing the  jewel  to  his  heart,  wept  with  Lakshmana.  And  be- 
holding that  marvellous  gem,  Raghava,  stricken  with  grief, 
his  eyes  suffused  with  tears,  said  to  Sugriva : — 

"  As  milk  flows  from  the  udders  of  a  cow  on  beholding  its 
calf,  so  does  my  heart  brim  over  on  beholding  this  jewel ! 
This  pearl  was  conferred  on  Sita  by  my  father-in-law  on  the 
occasion  of  our  nuptuals  and  she  wore  it  on  her  brow,  thus 
enhancing  her  beauty.  Obtained  from  the  waters  and  rever- 
enced by  the  Gods,  it  was  conferred  on  Janaka  by  the  sagacious 
Shakra,  gratified  by  his  adoration  at  a  sacrifice. 

"  Seeing  this  magnificent  gem,  I  recall  the  presence  of  my 
sire  and  my  father-in-law,  the  King  of  Videha.  This  lovely 
ornament  appeared  beautiful  on  the  forehead  of  my  beloved 
and  seeing  it,  it  seems  as  if  she  herself  were  present  here' 
As  if  sprinkling  water  on  one  who  has  lost  consciousness, 
do  thou  relate  to  me  what  Vaidehi  hath  said,  again  and  again, 
O  Friend!  What  could  be  more  poignant,  O  Saumitri,  than 
seeing  this  pearl  obtained  from  the  waters,  without  Vaidehi  ? 
If  she  survive  one  month  more,  she  will  five  long,  but  it  is 
hard  for  me  to  exist  an  instant  without  Sita !  Do  thou  lead 
me  to  where  thou  hast  seen  my  beloved ;  after  hearing  these 
tidings,  I  cannot  brook  a  moment's  delay.  How  can  that  lady 
of  lovely  hips,  who  was  ever  timorous,  endure  life  amidst 
those  grim  and  fearful  demons?  As  the  autumnal  moon, 
enveloped  in  cloud  is  unable  to  shine  forth,  so  Sita's  counten- 
ance is  no  longer  resplendent.  O  Hanuman,  do  thou  relate 
49* 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

unto  me  again  and  again  what  Sita  said  to  thee.  These  words 
will  revive  me  as  the  sick  are  cured  by  medicine.  O  Hanuman, 
what  did  my  gentle,  sweet-spoken  and  beautiful  lady,  who  is 
separated  from  me,  say  to  thee?  How  is  that  daughter  of 
Janaka  able  to  survive  in  her  dire  misfortune  ?  " 


chapter    67 

Hanuman  describes  his  Interview  with  Sita 

Being  thus  addressed  by  the  bigh-souled  Raghava,  Hanuman 
began  to  relate  all  that  Sita  had  said  to  him : — 

"  O  Lion  among  Men,  in  order  to  give  credence  to  my 
report,  the  divine  Sita  described  what  took  place  on  Mount 
Chittrakuta.  Sleeping  happily  at  thy  side,  Janaki  one  day 
was  the  first  to  wake,  when  suddenly  a  crow  wounded  her 
breast  with  its  beak.  O  Rama,  thou  wert  then  asleep  on 
Sita's  lap  and  that  crow  again  attacked  her,  pecking  her  cruelly, 
and,  being  bathed  in  blood  and  suffering,  she  did  arouse  thee. 
O  Slayer  of  thy  foes,  seeing  her  breast  wounded,  thou,  like  an 
angry  serpent  didst  enquire,  saying : — '  Who,  O  Timid  One, 
hath  with  his  claws  wounded  thee  ?  Who  hath  dared  to  play 
with  a  five-headed  snake  ? '  Then,  looking  here  and  there, 
thou  didst  perceive  the  crow  with  its  talons  sharp  and  bloody 
standing  before  thee.  And  that  foremost  of  birds  was  Indra's 
son,  who  with  the  speed  of  the  wind  disappeared  into  the 
earth.  Then  thou,  O  Mighty-armed  One,  didst  roll  thine 
eyes  furiously  and  resolve  to  destroy  that  crow.  Taking  a 
tuft  of  Kusha  grass  from  where  thou  hadst  lain,  pronouncing 
the  Brahma-mantra,  thou  didst  hurl  the  blade  that  blazed  up 
like  the  fire  at  the  dissolution  of  the  world  at  the  bird  and 
that  naming  grass  followed  in  its  wake. 

"  Forsaken  by  the  Gods,  who  were  terrified,  that  crow 

traversed  the  Three  Worlds  without  finding  a  protector  and 

returned  to  thee,  O  Subduer  of  thy  foes,  seeking  refuge  in  thee 

and  falling  on  the  earth  before  thee.  Thereupon,  O  Kakutstha, 

499  8K 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

thou  in  thy  compassion  didst  pardon  it,  albeit  it  merited  death. 
But  thinking  it  improper  that  the  purpose  of  the  weapon  should 
be  rendered  void,  thou  didst  destroy  the  right  eye  of  that  crow, 

0  Raghava.  Then  paying  homage  to  thee  and  to  King 
Dasaratha,  that  bird,  thus  delivered,  returned  to  its  abode. 

"  Sita  said : — '  O  Raghava,  thou  art  the  foremost  of  those 
skilled  in  weapons,  mighty  and  full  of  integrity,  why  dost 
thou  not  discharge  thy  shafts  against  the  titans  ?  Neither  the 
Gods,  Gandharvas,  Asuras  or  Maruta  can  withstand  thee  in 
battle.  If  thou  in  thy  magnanimity  hast  any  regard  for  me, 
then  with  thy  well-directed  shafts  destroy  Ravana  without 
delay.  Under  the  behest  of  his  brother,  why  does  not  Laksh- 
mana,  the  scourge  of  his  foes  and  the  foremost  of  men,  fly 
to  my  defence  ? 

" '  How  is  it  that  those  two  mighty  lions  among  men,  the 
equals  of  Vayu  and  Agni  in  valour,  whom  the  Gods  them- 
selves are  unable  to  overcome,  have  forgotten  me  ?   Assuredly 

1  have  committed  a  great  sin,  since  those  two  scourges  of 
their  foes,  who  are  able  to  do  so,  do  not  unite  to  deliver  me  ! ' 

"  To  those  plaintive  and  gentle  words  of  the  noble  Vaidehi, 
I  answered :  '  O  Illustrious  Lady,  Rama  is  sorely  stricken  on 
account  of  thine  absence  and  seeing  his  brother  a  prey  to 
sorrow,  Lakshmana  too  is  suffering,  I  swear  it.  Since  I  have 
found  thee  at  last,  the  time  for  lamentation  is  past.  In  an 
instant  thou  shalt  see  the  end  of  thy  woes,  O  Lovely  Princess. 
Those  two  sons  of  a  king,  the  foremost  of  men  and  subduers 
of  their  foes,  eager  to  see  thee  once  more,  will  reduce  Lanka 
to  ashes.  Having  slain  the  cruel  Ravana  with  his  kinsfolk  in 
battle,  Raghava  will  take  thee  back  to  his  capital,  O  Charming 
One !  O  Irreproachable  Lady,  do  thou  bestow  some  token 
on  me  that  is  known  to  Rama  and  will  bring  him  delight.' 

"Thereat  Sita,  glancing  round  on  every  side,  drew  from 
her  robe  an  excellent  jewel  which  had  fastened  her  locks  and 
bestowed  it  on  me,  O  Mighty  One. 

"  Then  I,  inclining  my  head  in  salutation,  took  the  gem  into 
my  hands  and  made  ready  to  depart,  O  Beloved  of  the  Raghu 
Race !  Whereupon,  seeing  me  about  to  take  my  leave  expand- 
ing my  body,  Sita,  the  beautiful  and  unfortunate  daughter  of 
Janata,  her  face  bathed  in  tears,  addressed  me  in  a  voice 
500 


SUNDARA    KANDA 

strangled  with  sobs  and,  in  the  intensity  of  distress  at  my 
departure,  said  to  me  : — 

" '  Happy  art  thou,  O  Monkey,  since  thou  shalt  behold  the 
mighty  Rama  whose  eyes  resemble  lotuses  and  the  long-armed 
Lakshmana,  my  illustrious  brother-in-law !  * 

"  To  these  words  of  Maithili,  I  made  answer : — *  Climb 
on  my  back  without  delay,  O  Noble  Lady,  and  this  very  day 
I  will  show  thee  Sugriva,  Lakshmana  and  thy  consort  Rama, 
O  Fortunate  Dark-eyed  Princess  ! ' 

M  Then  that  Goddess  answered  me,  saying : — *  It  is  not 
proper  for  me  to  climb  on  thy  back  of  mine  own  accord,  O 
Great  Monkey !  Although  before  this  I  was  touched  by  the 
demon,  it  was  on  account  of  my  helplessness,  subject  as  I 
was  to  destiny.  Do  thou  thyself  repair  to  where  those  two 
princes  are  ! '  After  this  she  added  : — 

"  *  O  Hanuman,  do  thou  greet  those  two  lions  among  men 
with  Sugriva  and  his  ministers  !  Do  thou  describe  unto  Rama 
and  Lakshmana  of  immeasurable  prowess  the  intensity  of  my 
despair  and  the  insults  heaped  on  me  by  the  titans.  May  thy 
journey  be  prosperous,  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys  ! ' 

"  Thus  did  that  illustrious  princess  speak  to  me  in  the 
midst  of  her  grief.  Reflecting  on  my  narrative,  have  faith  in 
the  integrity  of  the  virtuous  Sita." 


CHAPTER     68 

He  repeats  his  Words  of  Consolation  to  Sita 

"  O  Foremost  of  Men,  that  Goddess  then  addressed  me  in 
the  mjdst  of  her  grief  out  of  love  for  thee  and  solicitude  on 
my  account,  saying  :— 

"  *  Do  thou  repeat  all  this  to  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  so  that 
he  may  come  with  all  speed  and,  having  slain  Ravana  in  combat, 
take  me  hence.  O  Hero,  O  Subduer  of  thy  foes,  if  it  find 
approval  with  thee,  rest  concealed  here  in  some  secret  spot 
for  one  more  day  to  relieve  thy  fatigue  and  to-morrow  thou 
canst  make  ready  to  depart  !  O  Hanuman,  in  thy  com- 
5« 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

pany  I  am  able  to  forget  my  sufferings  awhile.  0  Thou 
gifted  with  great  prowess,  I  shall  await  thy  return  but 
doubt  if  I  shall  be  living  then.  Beholding  thee  no  more,  I 
shall  be  consumed  with  fear,  unfortunate  creature  that  I  am, 
overwhelmed  with  affliction  !  Moreover  I  am  filled  with  doubt 
regarding  thy  companions,  the  bears  and  monkeys  and  how 
in  effect,  they  and  those  two  princes  will  be  able  to  cross  the 
impassable  ocean.  O  Irreproachable  Warrior,  there  are  only 
three  creatures  qualified  to  traverse  the  sea — Garuda,  Vayu 
and  thyself.  In  view  of  this  insurmountable  obstacle,  what 
possibility  of  success  dost  thou  see,  O  Thou  foremost  of  those 
skilled  in  the  art  of  converse  ?  True  it  is,  that  thou  art  able  to 
accomplish  this  work  single-handed,  O  Subduer  of  thy  foes, 
but  such  a  manifestation  of  prowess  would  benefit  thee  alone. 
If  Rama  however,  with  his  forces,  slaying  Ravana  in  fight, 
were  to  bring  me  back  in  triumph  to  his  capital,  it  would 
redound  to  his  glory.  It  would  not  be  worthy  of  Raghava  to 
capture  me  by  stealth  as  did  Ravana,  who  under  a  disguise 
bore  me  away  from  the  forest.  Truly  it  would  prove  a  feat 
of  signal  excellence,  worthy  of  him,  if  Kakutstha,  the  con- 
queror of  his  foes,  should  destroy  Lanka  and  deliver  me. 
Do  thou  so  act  that  that  high-souled  hero  may  display  his 
prowess ! ' 

"  Hearing  these  words,  full  of  good  sense,  reasonable  and 
affectionate,  I  replied  for  the  last  time : — 

"  '  O  Goddess,  Sugriva,  the  Leader  of  the  bears  and  monkeys, 
gifted  with  valour,  has  resolved  to  deliver  thee.  He  hath 
under  his  command  innumerable  powerful  and  courageous 
monkeys  gifted  with  prowess,  who  are  as  swift  as  thought, 
able  to  go  upwards  or  downwards  and  to  every  side,  whom 
nothing  can  impede  nor  may  they  be  daunted  by  the  hardest 
tasks.  Moreover  those  great  and  powerful  monkeys,  endowed 
with  vigour,  have  circled  the  earth  again  and  again,  coursing 
through  the  air.  Sugriva  has  many  monkeys  equal  to  me 
and  greater ;  none  are  inferior.  If  I  am  able  to  cross  the  sea, 
how  much  more  these  heroes  ?  The  great  ones  are  never  sent 
out  on  a  mission  but  those  of  inferior  merit  only. 

"  O  Lady,  now  abandon  grief;  in  one  bound  those  leaders 
of  the  monkey  hosts  will  reach  Lanka  and  these  two  lions 
502 


SUNDARA    KANjDA 

among  men,  like  unto  the  sun  and  moon,  will  present  them- 
selves to  thee,  O  Princess.  Soon  shalt  thou  see  at  Lanka's 
gate,  Raghava,  resembling  a  lion  and  Lakshmana,  bow  in 
hand.  And  thou  shalt  soon  behold  those  monkey  warriors, 
endowed  with  the  strength  of  lions  and  tigers,  whose  weapons 
are  their  nails  and  teeth,  resembling  the  lords  of  the  elephants, 
hastening  here  without  delay.  Ere  long  thou  shalt  hear  the 
roaring  of  those  leaders  of  monkeys  on  the  summit  of  the 
Mount  Malaya,  resembling  the  rumbling  of  clouds.  Soon 
thou  shalt  see  Raghava,  the  Slayer  of  His  foes,  returning  from 
his  exile  in  the  forest,  installed  on  the  throne  with  thee  in 
Ayodhya.' 

"  Thereafter  the  daughter  of  the  King  of  Mitbila,  though 
profoundly  afflicted  by  thine  absence,  was  comforted  by  these 
auspicious  words  and  experienced  great  peace."

CHAPTER     I 

Rama  felicitates   Hanuman. — His   Perplexities 

Hearing  Hanuman's  faithful  narrative,  Rama,  full  of  joy,  said  : 
"  The  mission  that  Hanuman  has  carried  out  is  of  great 
significance  and  the  most  arduous  in  the  world ;  none  other 
could  have  achieved  it,  even  in  thought !  Other  than  Garuda 
and  Vayu,  verily  I  know  of  no  being  able  to  cross  the  mighty 
ocean  save  Hanuman  himself.  Neither  Gods,  Danavas,  Yakshas, 
Gandharvas,  Uragas  nor  Rakshasas  could  enter  Lanka  which  is 
protected  by  Ravana  and,  did  any  in  his  presumption  enter 
it,  would  he  return  alive  ?  Who  is  able  to  capture  that  citadel 
by  assault,  that  has  been  rendered  inaccessible  by  its  rampart 
of  titans,  but  one  whose  courage  and  valour  are  equal  to 
Hanuman's  ?  Hanuman  has  carried  out  this  important  service 
for  Sugriva  by  manifesting  a  strength  equal  to  his  audacity. 
That  servant  to  whom  his  master  confides  a  difficult  task  and 
who  acquits  himself  with  zeal  is  said  to  be  a  superior  man.  The 
one  who  is  ready  and  capable  but  who  yet  does  no  more  than 
his  sovereign  exacts  from  him,  in  order  to  render  himself 
agreeable,  is  called  an  ordinary  man,  but  he  who  is  well  and 
able  and  yet  does  not  carry  out  the  command  of  his  king,  is 
said  to  be  the  least  of  men.  Hanuman  has  fulfilled  the  task 
confided  to  him  unfalteringly,  to  the  satisfaction  of  Sugriva;  in 
consequence,  through  the  discovery  of  Vaidehi's  retreat  by 
this  faithful  messenger,  the  House  of  Raghu,  the  valiant 
Lakshmana  and  I  have  been  saved.  Yet  even  so  my  heart  is 
heavy,  since  I  am  not  able  to  requite  the  bearer  of  these  good 
tidings  in  a  fitting  manner.  Let  me  at  least  embrace  the  mag- 
nanimous Hanuman  since,  in  the  present  circumstances,  this 
is  all  that  is  permitted  to  me ! " 

Having  spoken  thus,  Rama,  trembling  with  joy,  clasped 
Hanuman  in  his  arms,  who,  master  of  himself,  his  mission 
fulfilled,  had  returned. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Then  the  great  Scion  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  after  reflecting 
awhile,  added  in  the  presence  of  Sugriva,  King  of  the  Monkeys  : 

"  Though  the  discovery  of  Sita  has  been  accomplished,  yet 
when  I  behold  that  vast  ocean,  I  am  plunged  in  despondency. 
How  will  the  army  of  the  monkeys  be  able  to  reach  the  southern 
shore,  crossing  over  that  impassable  stretch  of  water  ?  Having 
received  these  tidings  of  Vaidehi,  what  can  now  be  done  to  take 
the  monkeys  to  the  further  side  of  the  ocean  ?  " 

In  the  anguish  that  possessed  him,  the  mighty  Rama,  scourge 
of  his  foes,  having  spoken  to  Hanuman,  was  filled  with  appre- 
hension and  became  absorbed  in  thought. 


CHAPTER    2 

Sugriva  consoles   Rama 

Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  being  plunged  in  despair,  the 
fortunate  Sugriva  spoke  to  him  in  consoling  accents,  saying : 
"  Why  dost  thou  give  way  to  sorrow  like  a  common  man,  O 
Hero  ?  Snake  off  this  melancholy  as  do  ungrateful  men  the 
recognition  of  favours  accorded  to  them.  After  the  tidings  thou 
hast  received  and  now  that  the  haunt  of  thine  enemy  is  known 
to  thee,  I  see  no  cause  for  thine  anxiety,  O  Raghava.  Prudent 
and  versed  in  the  scriptures,  intelligent  and  cultured  as  thou 
art,  do  thou  as  one  master  of  himself,  banish  these  unworthy 
fears  that  are  the  obstacles  to  success.  We  shall  cross  the  sea 
where  monstrous  crocodiles  abound,  take  Lanka  by  assault  and 
slay  thine  adversary  !  The  pusillanimous  and  despondent  man, 
whose  mind  is  agitated  by  grief,  accomplishes  nothing  worth 
while  and  rushes  towards  destruction. 

"  In  order  to  please  thee,  these  monkey  warriors  who  are  brave 
and  skilled  are  ready  to  enter  a  blazing  fire !  Observing  their 
martial  ardour  I  am  filled  with  confidence ;  do  thou  test  my 
courage  by  suffering  me  to  bring  back  Sita  to  thee  after  having 
slain  thine  adversary  Ravana  of  evil  exploits.  But  first  construct 
a  bridge  for  us  that  we  may  approach  that  city  of  the  Lord  of  the 
Titans.    The  instant  we  behold  Lanka,  built  on  the  summit 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

of  Trikuta,  Ravana  is  slain  as  it  were,  but  unless  a  bridge  is 
thrown  over  that  formidable  domain  of  Varuna,  the  sea,  the 
Gods  and  Asuras  themselves  with  their  leaders  cannot  force  an 
entry  into  Lanka. 

"  When  that  dyke  on  the  waters  in  the  vicinity  of  Lanka  is 
constructed  and  all  the  troops  shall  have  passed  over  it,  Ravana 
is,  as  it  were,  already  defeated,  so  valiant  are  these  monkey 
warriors  who  are  able  to  change  their  form  at  will. 

"Enough of  this  faint-hearted  attitude, fatal  to  any  enterprise, 
O  King.  In  this  world,  man  is  unbraced  by  sorrow ;  that  which 
must  be  done  should  be  accomplished  with  resolution,  it  is 
assuredly  expedient  to  act  swiftly !  For  this  enterprise,  O 
Great  Sage,  unite  energy  with  virtue,  for,  if  it  be  a  question  of 
loss  or  death,  the  great  warriors,  thy  peers,  see  grief  as  the  con- 
sumer of  their  resources.  Thou  art  the  foremost  of  the  wise 
and  versed  in  all  the  scriptures ;  with  allies  such  as  I  am,  thy 
victory  is  assured  !  In  sooth  I  see  none  in  the  Three  Worlds 
able  to  withstand  thee  in  combat  when  thou  art  armed  with  thy 
bow  !  With  the  success  of  thine  enterprise  in  the  hands  of  the 
monkeys,  thou  canst  not  fail.  When  thou  hast  crossed  the 
imperishable  ocean  thou  shalt  see  Sita  ere  long.  Desist  from 
this  melancholy  that  thou  hast  allowed  to  invade  thee  and  yield 
to  thy  legitimate  indignation,  O  Prince.  Unadventurous 
warriors  never  win  honour  but  all  fear  the  wrathful.  It  is  for 
the  purpose  of  crossing  the  formidable  ocean,  the  Lord  of 
Rivers,  that  thou  hast  come  hither  with  us;  now  with  thy 
resourceful  mind  ponder  on  it.  Once  the  ocean  has  been 
crossed  by  my  forces,  know  victory  to  be  certain ;  verily  when 
the  whole  army  has  passed  over  the  sea,  our  triumph  is  assured  ! 

"  The  monkeys,  those  courageous  soldiers,  who  are  able  to 
change  their  form  at  pleasure,  will  crush  their  opponents  with 
an  avalanche  of  rocks  and  trees.  Whatever  the  means  employed, 
once  we  have  crossed  Varuna's  domain,  Ravana  is  as  dead  in 
mine  eyes,  O  Destroyer  of  Thy  Foes  !  But  of  what  use  are  all 
these  words  ?  Thy  victory  is  assured  and  the  portents,  which  I 
perceive,  fill  my  heart  with  joy." 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    3 

Hanuman  describes  the  Strength  of  Lanka  to  Rama 

These  words  of  Sugriva,  judicious  and  full  of  good  sense, 
pleased  Kakutstha  who  said  to  Hanuman  : — 

"  By  the  power  of  mine  austerities,  I  am  well  able  to  cross 
the  ocean  by  throwing  a  bridge  over  it  or  even  drying  it  up. 
What  are  the  fortifications  of  this  inaccessible  Lanka  ?  Describe 
them  fully  to  me,  I  wish  to  hear  all  about  them  as  if  I  had 
myself  beheld  them,  O  Monkey.  How  are  its  gates  manned ; 
what  is  the  strength  of  the  army ;  what  kind  of  moats  surround 
it  and  how  are  the  retreats  of  the  titans  constructed  ?  Thou 
didst  explore  Lanka  at  thy  leisure  when  opportunity  arose,  now 
in  the  light  of  thine  observations  give  me  exact  and  complete 
information  thereon." 

Thus  interrogated  by  Rama,  Hanuman,  the  Son  of  Maruta, 
the  most  eloquent  of  narrators,  said  : — 

"  Hear,  O  King,  I  will  tell  thee  the  extent  of  the  defences,  of 
the  moats  and  the  number  of  troops  guarding  that  city.  I  will 
describe  to  thee  the  opulence  of  those  titans  and  the  great 
prosperity  of  their  capital  due  to  Ravana's  austerities ;  I  will 
tell  thee  also  of  the  formidable  ocean  and  the  many  regiments 
of  infantry  and  the  strength  of  the  cavalry  ". 

After  this  preamble,  the  foremost  of  monkeys  began  to  relate 
lucidly  everything  he  knew  and  said : — 

"  Filled  with  happy  people,  Lanka  abounds  in  elephants 
intoxicated  with  Mada  juice  and  is  swarming  with  chariots  and 
titans.  It  has  four  immense  gateways  that  are  extremely  high 
and  furnished  with  strong  doors  which  are  closed  with  massive 
iron  bars.  Catapults,  darts  and  stones  are  placed  near  at  hand, 
capable  of  repelling  the  assaults  of  the  enemy  and  the  valiant 
titans  have  heaped  in  readiness,  formidable  spears  in  their 
hundreds. 

"  The  city  is  encircled  by  a  high  golden  wall  difficult  to  scale, 
lined  within  with  precious  gems,  coral,  emerald  and  pearl. 
6 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

On  all  sides  awe-inspiring  moats  of  great  splendour,  filled  with 
icy  water,  have  been  dug,  which  are  deep  and  abounding  in 
crocodiles  and  fishes.  At  the  entrance  to  these  dykes  there  are 
four  long  draw-bridges  furnished  with  innumerable  weapons 
and  five  great  cannons  are  placed  round  about  which  defend 
the  entries  against  the  approach  of  the  enemy,  whose  battalions 
would  be  flung  by  these  engines  of  war  into  the  moats  on  every 
side.  The  most  important  of  these  bastions,  impossible  to 
force,  is  of  unsuperable  strength  and  dazzling  with  its  pillars 
and  fulcrums  of  gold. 

"  Endowed  with  great  physical  strength,  O  Prince,  Ravana  is 
avid  for  combat,  ever  on  the  alert  and  constantly  reviewing  his 
forces.  Lanka  is  therefore  impregnable,  it  is  a  celestial  citadel 
that  inspires  terror.  Surrounded  by  water,  built  on  a  mountain 
with  its  fourfold  defences1,  it  is  situated  on  the  other  side  of 
the  impassable  ocean,  O  Rama,  where  no  vessel  can  approach 
it,  as  it  offers  no  harbourage  anywhere.  Built  on  the  summit 
of  an  inaccessible  rock,  Lanka,  where  horses  and  elephants 
abound,  resembling  the  City  of  the  Gods,  is  extremely  difficult 
to  conquer.  With  its  moats  and  Shataghnis,  its  engines  of 
war  of  every  kind,  that  capital  of  the  wicked  Ravana  is  unique. 

*'  The  eastern  gate  is  defended  by  ten  thousand  men,  all  skilled 
warriors  armed  with  spears,  the  foremost  of  swordsmen ;  the 
southern  gate  is  guarded  by  a  hundred  thousand  warriors, 
there  a  whole  army  of  seasoned  fighters  is  assembled ;  ten 
thousand  troops  armed  with  swords  and  shields,  all  accustomed 
to  the  wielding  of  weapons,  defend  the  western  gate ;  the 
northern  gate  is  protected  by  a  million  men  who  are  mounted 
in  chariots  or  who  ride  on  horses ;  they  are  the  sons  of  distin- 
guished families.  Titans  to  the  number  of  hundreds  and 
thousands  occupy  the  centre  of  the  city  with  one  million  tested 
troops  in  addition. 

"  I  have  destroyed  the  ramparts  and  filled  up  the  moats  and, 
having  torn  down  the  walls,  have  set  fire  to  the  town,  therefore, 
if  we  can  find  some  means  of  crossing  Varuna's  domain,  the 
city  is  ours  ;  let  the  monkeys  deliberate  on  the  matter. 

"  Angada,  Dvivida,  Mainda,  Jambavan,  Panasa,  Nala  and  the 
General  Nila  will  fall  upon  Ravana's  capital  with  its  hills,

woods,  moats,  archways  and  ramparts  and  bring  Sita  back  to 
thee,  O  Raghava,  what  need  is  there  of  the  rest  of  the  monkeys  ? 
Come,  give  the  command  quickly  to  the  whole  army  of  these 
valiant  monkeys  and,  at  a  propitious  hour,  let  us  set  out !  " 


CHAPTER    4 

The  Army  reaches  the  Shores  of  the  Sea 

Having  listened  to  the  judicious  and  well-reasoned  speech  of 
Hanuman,  the  illustrious  Rama,  a  true  hero,  spoke  saying : — 

"  Now  that  thou  hast  told  me  everything  concerning  Lanka, 
that  dread  citadel  of  the  terrible  demons,  I  shall  make  prepara- 
tions to  destroy  it  without  delay,  this  is  the  truth  ! 

"  O  Sugriva,  be  gracious  enough  to  order  our  departure ;  the 
sun  is  in  mid-heaven  and  has  entered  the  constellation  of  victory1. 
As  for  Sita's  abductor,  he  shall  not  escape,  wherever  he  may  go ! 
When  Sita  learns  of  my  approach,  her  hopes  will  revive,  as 
one  who,  having  drunk  poison  and  on  the  point  of  death, 
quaffs  the  nectar  of  immortality. 

"  The  northern  planet  Phalguni  is  in  the  ascendent  and 
will  be  in  conjunction  with  the  Hasta  Star  to-morrow.  Let 
us  depart,  O  Sugriva,  and  let  all  the  troops  accompany  us; 
every  portent  is  favourable  !  Having  slain  Ravana,  I  shall 
return  with  Sita,  the  daughter  of  Janaka.  My  right  eye-lid  is 
twitching  which  is  an  indication  that  victory  is  near  and  that 
my  purpose  will  be  accomplished." 

At  these  words,  King  Sugriva  and  Lakshmana,  bowing  low, 
paid  obeisance  to  Rama,  who,  full  of  faith  and  versed  in  the 
moral  law,  spoke  once  more,  saying  : — 

"  Let  General  Nila  with  a  guard  of  a  hundred  thousand 
intrepid  warriors  go  before  the  army  to  explore  the  way.  He 
should  lead  his  forces  speedily  by  the  path  where  fruit,  roots, 
shade,  fresh  water  and  honey  abound.  In  their  wickedness, 
the  demons  are  capable  of  destroying  the  roots  and  fruits  and 

*  Abhijit.     (See  Glossary.) 

g 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

vitiating  the  water  on  the  way.  Keep  them  at  a  distance  and 
be  on  your  guard  !  Let  those  dwellers  of  the  woods  search  the 
ravines  and  dense  thickets  in  the  forest  in  order  to  discover 
the  ambushes  of  the  enemy. 

"  Those  who  are  weak  should  remain  here  for  your  task  is 
formidable  and  demands  endurance;  therefore  let  the  foremost 
of  the  monkeys  gifted  with  prodigious  prowess  lead  the  vanguard, 
composed  of  hundreds  and  thousands  of  monkeys,  resembling 
the  waters  of  the  sea.  Let  Gaja  who  is  like  unto  a  hill  and  the 
exceedingly  powerful  Gavaya  and  Gavaksha  go  ahead  like 
proud  bulls  leading  the  kine.  The  leader  of  monkeys,  Rishabha, 
skilled  in  leaping,  should  protect  the  right  flank  of  the  army 
and  the  fiery  Gandhamadana,  resembling  an  elephant  in  mustha, 
should  defend  the  left  flank.  I  myself,  mounted  on  the  shoulders 
of  Hanuman,  like  Indra  on  Airavata,  will  march  in  the  centre 
of  my  troops  in  order  to  encourage  them.  Lakshmana  who 
resembles  death  itself,  will  ride  on  the  shoulders  of  Angada,  as 
Kuvera,  the  Lord  of  Creatures  and  God  of  Wealth  on  Sarva- 
bhauma.  Let  the  mighty  Lord  of  the  Bears,  Jambavan  with 
Sushena  and  the  monkey  Vegadarshin,  all  three,  protect  the 
rear  of  the  army." 

Hearing  Raghava's  words,  Sugriva,  commander  of  the  forces, 
gave  his  orders  to  the  monkeys.  Thereupon  a  multitude  of 
monkeys,  eager  to  right,  issued  from  the  caves  and  mountain 
peaks,  leaping  on  all  sides.  Honoured  by  the  King  of  the 
Monkeys,  as  also  by  Lakshmana,  the  virtuous  Rama,  accom- 
panied by  hundreds  and  thousands  of  monkeys  resembling 
elephants,  set  out  in  a  southerly  direction  and  under  Sugriva's 
command,  that  great  army  in  high  spirits,  betraying  its  delight, 
escorted  him. 

Guarding  the  flanks  of  the  army  and  pressing  forward,  they 
ran  towards  the  south,  leaping  on  all  sides,  emitting  leonine 
roars,  growling  and  shouting,  feeding  on  honey  and  delicious 
fruits,  brandishing  great  trees  and  flowering  shrubs.  In  their 
pugnacity,  some  lifted  their  fellows  up  and  threw  them  down 
or  climbed  on  each  others  backs  vying  with  one  another  in 
turning  somersaults. 

"  We  will  slay  Ravana  with  all  his  nocturnal  rangers ! " 
Thus  did  those  monkeys  roar  in  the  presence  of  Rama. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Going  in  advance  of  the  army,  Rishabha,  the  valiant  Nila 
and  also  Kumuda  cleared  the  way  with  the  assistance  of 
innumerable  monkeys.  In  the  centre,  the  King  Sugriva,  Rama 
and  Lakshmana,  scourges  of  their  foes,  were  surrounded  by 
countless  redoutable  warriors.  The  courageous  monkey, 
Shatabali,  at  the  head  of  ten  kotis,  was,  in  himself,  sufficient  to 
protect  the  entire  host  of  monkeys !  With  an  escort  of  a 
hundred  kotis,  Kesarin  and  Panasa,  Gaja  and  Arka  with  their 
battalions  protected  the  flanks  of  that  army,  whilst  Sushena 
and  Jambavan  surrounded  by  a  multitude  of  bears,  having 
placed  Sugriva  at  the  head,  formed  the  rearguard.  The  valiant 
General  Nila,  a  lion  among  monkeys,  who  excelled  in  marching, 
constantly  inspected  the  ranks,  and  Valimukha,  Prajangha, 
Jambha  and  the  monkey  Rabhasa  went  about  everywhere 
encouraging  the  Plavamgamas. 

Whilst  those  lions  among  monkeys  advanced  on  every  side 
proud  of  their  strength,  they  beheld  the  great  Mountain  Sahya 
crowned  with  hundreds  of  trees  and  lakes  and  lovely  pools 
covered  with  flowers. 

Under  the  command  of  Rama  of  searing  wrath,  skirting  the 
precincts  of  cities  and  public  highways,  that  vast  and  terrible 
army  of  monkeys,  like  the  ocean  tide,  surged  forward  with  a 
thunderous  sound.  At  the  side  of  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  those 
heroic  monkeys  bounded  forward  with  agility,  like  swift  steeds 
urged  on  by  the  spur.  And  those  foremost  of  men,  borne  on  the 
shoulders  of  the  monkeys,  appeared  beautiful  like  the  sun  and 
moon,  in  conjunction  with  those  two  great  planets,  Rahu  and 
Ketu,  and  honoured  by  the  King  of  the  Monkeys  and 
Lakshmana,  Rama  accompanied  by  his  army,  proceeded  towards 
the  south. 

Then  Lakshmana,  mounted  on  Angada's  shoulders,  spoke  to 
Rama  who  was  accomplishing  his  design,  in  sweet  accents, 
saying : — 

"  Having  regained  Vaidehi  and  slain  Ravana  her  abductor, 
thus  fulfilling  thy  purpose,  thou  wilt  return  to  Ayodhya,  who,1 
too,  will  be  gratified.  I  perceive  auspicious  omens  in  the 
heavens  and  on  the  earth,  O  Descendant  of  Raghu,  indicating 
the  success  of  thine  enterprise !    A  favourable  wind  blows 

>  That  is  the  presiding  Deity  of  the  City. 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

behind  the  army,  that  is  soft,  health-giving  and  auspicious ; 
birds  and  beasts  emit  cheerful  and  sonorous  sounds ;  all  the 
quarters  are  serene  and  the  sun  shines  clearly.  Ushanas, 
Bhrigu's  son,  too,  wears  an  auspicious  aspect  for  thee,  and  the 
pole  star  is  unaccompanied  by  adverse  planets,  the  seven 
Rishis,  pure  and  brilliant,  circumambulating  it.  Before  us 
shines  the  grandsire  of  the  high-souled  Ikshvakus,  the  immacu- 
late Trishanku  accompanied  by  his  priest;  and  the  twin 
Vishakas,  our  racial  star,  gleam  free  from  obstruction. 

"  Nairrita,  the  ruling  star  of  the  titans,  is  badly  aspected  and 
in  opposition  to  the  rising  planet  Dhumaketu,  presaging  the 
overthrow  of  the  titans.  Those  about  to  die,  in  their  last  hour, 
become  a  prey  to  Graha.  The  water  of  the  lakes  is  fresh  and 
tastes  sweet,  the  woods  are  laden  with  fruit,  fragrant  breezes 
blow  softly  and  the  trees  are  flowering  out  of  season,  O  Lord  E 
The  army  of  the  monkeys  looks  splendid  in  its  formations, 
like  the  Celestial  Host  at  the  destruction  of  Taraka.  Surveying 
the  whole  scene,  O  Noble  One,  thou  shouldst  experience 
supreme  delight ! " 

Thus  did  Saumitri  speak  in  gay  tones  to  his  elder  brother 
in  order  to  console  him  and  meantime  the  army  of  the  monkeys 
advanced,  covering  the  earth.  The  dust  raised  by  those 
mighty  bears  and  monkeys,  furnished  with  nails  and  claws, 
enveloped  the  whole  earth  and  the  splendour  of  the  sun  was 
obscured.  Like  a  mass  of  cloud  enveloping  the  sky,  that  monkey 
army  advanced  in  solid  formation  encompassing  the  southern 
region.  As  they  pressed  on  mile  on  mile,  crossing  the  rivers 
and  streams  against  the  current,  they  traversed  many  leagues 
in  one  stretch.  Resting  by  lakes  of  pure  water,  passing  over 
mountains  covered  with  forests,  across  plains,  through  woods 
laden  with  fruit,  skirting  them  or  passing  through  the  centre, 
they  went  on,  covering  the  entire  earth,  and  their  countenances 
manifesting  joy,  they  ran  with  the  swiftness  of  the  wind. 

All  those  monkeys  were  zealous  in  Rama's  service,  each 
vying  with  the  other  in  high  spirits,  vigour  and  prowess.  Some, 
proud  of  their  youth  and  supple  limbs,  increased  their  pace, 
running  with  extreme  speed  and  executing  handsprings  and 
some  of  those  rangers  of  the  woods  shouted  *  Kila !  Kila  ! ' 
lashing  their  tails  and  stamping  on  the  earth  whilst  others  with 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

upraised  arms  broke  off  the  trees  and  rocks  here  and  there  or 
climbed  to  the  summit  of  the  mountains  like  true  mountaineers. 
Emitting  loud  cries  and  roaring,  they  frequently  tore  down 
handfuls  of  creepers  with  their  thighs.  In  their  energy,  with 
their  jaws  set,  some  juggled  with  rocks  and  trees.  It  was  by 
hundreds  and  thousands  and  millions  that  these  formidable 
monkeys  covered  the  earth  with  their  splendour ;  and  that  great 
army  of  monkeys,  full  of  energy,  proceeding  under  Sugriva's 
orders,  eager  for  battle  and  anxious  to  deliver  Sita,  did  not 
linger  even  for  an  instant. 

Then  Rama,  seeing  the  Sahira  and  Malaya  Mountains  with 
their  dense  woodlands  frequented  by  various  kinds  of  wild 
animals  and  marvellous  forests,  streams  and  rivers,  went 
towards  them,  and  the  monkeys  broke  down  Champaka, 
Tilaka,  Cuta,  Praseka,  Sindubaraka,  Tinisha,  Karavira,  Ashoka, 
Karanja,  Flaksha,  Nyagrodha,  Jambuka  and  Amlaka  Trees,  and, 
seated  on  those  enchanting  plateaus,  the  forest  trees  shaken  by 
the  wind  covered  them  with  flowers. 

A  soft  breeze,  fresh  and  perfumed  with  sandal,  blew  while 
the  bees  hummed  in  the  nectar  scented  woods.  From  this 
mountain,  rich  in  ore,  the  dust  raised  by  those  monkeys 
enveloped  that  immense  army  on  all  sides. 

On  the  smiling  mountain  slopes,  Ketaka  Trees,  Sinduvara, 
charming  Vasanti,  scented  Madhavi,  clumps  of  Jasmine, 
Shiribilva,  Madhuka,  Vanjula,  Vankula,  Ranjaka,  Tilaka 
Nagavriksha,  all  in  flower,  with  Cuta,  Patalika,  Kovidara, 
Muchulinda,  Arjuna,  Shimshapa,  Kutaja,  Hintala,  Tinisha, 
Shurnakha,  Nipaka,  the  blue  Ashoka,  Sarala,  Ankola  and 
Padmaka  Trees  bloomed  and  teemed  with  monkeys  disporting 
themselves  there.  Enchanting  lakes  and  pools,  frequented  by 
waterfowl,  ducks  and  herons,  were  to  be  found  on  that  mountain, 
which  was  the  haunt  of  boars,  deer,  bears,  hyenas,  lions  and 
tigers  inspiring  terror,  and  innumerable  venomous  snakes 
infested  it.  Kumudas,  Utpalas  and  many  other  flowers 
embellished  the  lakes,  and  flocks  of  birds  of  various  kinds  sang 
on  that  mountain  side. 

Having  bathed  in  those  waters  and  quenched  their  thirst, 
the  monkeys  began  to  disport  themselves  and  splashing  one 
another,  climbing  the  mountain,  they  plucked  the  delicious 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

fruits  as  fragrant  as  '  Amrita '  and  the  roots  and  flowers  from 
the  trees.  Yellow  as  honey  themselves,  they,  delighted,  feasted 
on  the  combs,  a  '  drona  '  in  size,  which  were  suspended  from 
the  trees,  and,  shaking  the  lovely  branches  and  letting  them 
spring  back  again,  they  tore  down  the  creepers ;  some  drunk 
with  nectar,  dancing  joyfully  as  they  continued  on  their  way ; 
some  climbed  the  trees,  others  quenched  their  thirst  and  the 
whole  earth,  covered  with  monkeys,  resembled  a  field  of  ripe  com. 

Reaching  the  Mahendra  Mountain,  the  long-armed  Rama, 
whose  eyes  resembled  lotus  petals,  climbed  to  the  summit 
adorned  with  various  wees  and  from  that  peak,  the  elder  son 
of  King  Dasaratha  beheld  that  vast  sea  with  its  rising  waves 
full  of  fish  and  turtle. 

Having  crossed  the  Sahya  and  Malaya  Mountains,  the  army 
halted  in  their  ranks  along  the  shores  of  the  sea  with  its  thunder- 
ing waves.  Then  that  foremost  of  men,  Rama,  descended  from 
the  heights  and  accompanied  by  Lakshmana  and  Sugriva, 
quickly  entered  a  lovely  wood  on  the  shores  of  the  ocean  and 
reaching  that  immense  strand  strewn  with  boulders,  washed 
by  the  billowing  waves,  he  spoke  thus : — 

"  O  Sugriva,  we  have  reached  the  abode  of  Varuna ;  now  we 
should  consider  the  matter  with  which  we  were  formerly 
preoccupied.  This  ocean,  the  Lord  of  Rivers,  with  its  vast 
expanse,  is  impossible  to  cross  unless  some  special  course  be 
adopted.  Let  us  camp  here  therefore  and  deliberate  on  the 
means  by  which  we  can  transport  the  army  to  the  further 
shore." 

Speaking  thus,  that  long-armed  hero,  who  had  been  rendered 
desolate  by  Sita's  abduction,  approached  the  sea  and  issued 
orders  for  the  troops  quartering. 

"  Let  the  whole  army  pitch  their  camp  on  the  shore,  O  Lion 
among  Monkeys !  The  time  has  come  to  take  counsel  and 
devise  some  way  to  cross  the  main ;  let  every  leader  remain  with 
his  forces  and,  under  no  pretext  whatever,  shall  he  leave  them ; 
meantime  they  should  find  out  if  any  ambush  has  been  laid 
by  the  enemy." 

At  Rama's  command,  Sugriva,  assisted  by  Lakshmana,  caused 
his  forces  to  camp  on  the  shore  which  was  covered  with  trees 
and  the  monkey  host  looked  resplendent  like  a  second  ocean 
13 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

whose  waves  were  yellow  as  honey.  Reaching  that  wooded 
shore  those  lions  of  monkeys  encamped,  eager  to  reach  the 
further  side  of  the  ocean;  and  the  tumult  caused  by  those  forces 
pitching  their  tents  could  be  heard  above  the  roaring  of  the  sea. 
That  vast  army  of  monkeys,  commanded  by  Sugriva,  ranged 
in  three  divisions,  were  deeply  concerned  with  the  accomplish- 
ment of  Rama's  mission  and,  from  the  shore  where  they  were 
stationed,  the  monkey  host  gazed  with  delight  on  the  vast  ocean 
lashed  by  the  tempest.  Then  those  leaders  of  monkeys  surveyed 
that  abode  of  Varuna  of  limitless  expanse,  whose  distant  shore 
was  inhabited  by  titans.  Rendered  formidable  by  the  ferocity 
of  its  sharks  and  crocodiles,  that  ocean,  with  its  foaming  waves 
at  the  close  of  day  and  the  approach  of  night,  appeared  to  laugh 
and  dance.  When  the  moon  rose,  whose  image  was  reflected 
limitlessly  in  its  bosom,  the  ocean  surged,  swarming  with 
gigantic  sharks,  whales  and  great  fish,  strong  like  the  tempest, 
and  it  was  fathomless,  abounding  in  serpents  of  flaming  coils 
and  many  aquatic  animals  and  reefs.  In  that  ocean,  difficult 
to  cross,  whose  ways  were  impassable,  haunted  by  titans,  the 
waves,  in  which  sharks  and  sea  monsters  swarmed,  rose  and 
fell  joyfully,  whipped  into  motion  by  the  breeze. 

Emitting  sparks  and  turbulent  with  its  gleaming  reptiles,  the 
ocean,  that  dread  refuge  of  the  enemies  of  the  Gods,  the  eternal 
region  of  hell,  resembled  the  sky  and  there  seemed  no  difference 
between  them.  The  waters  simulated  the  firmament  and  the 
firmament  the  waters,  both  manifesting  the  same  appearance 
with  the  stars  above  and  the  pearls  below  with  which  they  were 
filled  and,  one  with  its  racing  clouds  and  the  other  with  its 
squadrons  of  waves,  caused  the  sea  and  sky  to  look  identical. 

As  wave  clashed  against  wave  without  pause,  the  King  of 
Rivers  emitted  a  terrific  clamour  like  the  sound  of  the  beating 
of  great  gongs  in  the  sky.  With  its  murmuring  waves,  its 
innumerable  pearls  and  its  monsters  as  it  were  pursuing  it  like 
a  pack  of  hounds,  the  ocean,  in  the  grip  of  a  hurricane,  seemed 
to  leap  excitedly. 

And  the  magnanimous  monkeys  surveyed  that  ocean  lashed 
by  the  winds  and  the  waves  which,  whipped  by  its  blast,  seemed 
to  groan.    Struck  with  astonishment,  those  monkeys  regarded 
the  sea  with  its  dashing  waves,  rolling  on  and  on.

CHAPTER    5 

Rama  is  afflicted  when   thinking  of  Sita 

On  the  northern  shore,  the  army  under  the  command  of  Nila 
halted  and  the  two  generals,  Mainda  and  Dvivida,  foremost 
among  the  monkeys,  patrolled  up  and  down  and  on  all  sides  in 
order  to  protect  the  monkey  host. 

The  army  being  thus  encamped  on  the  shores  of  the  Lord 
of  the  Waters,  Rama,  observing  Lakshmana  standing  at  his  side, 
said  to  him : — 

"  Sorrow  invariably  decreases  with  the  passing  of  time  but 
in  the  absence  of  my  beloved,  mine  increases  daily !  Not  that 
my  sufferings  are  caused  by  separation  from  my  companion 
nor  my  misfortune  by  her  abduction,  what  I  deplore  is  that  her 
youth  is  slipping  away.  O  Breeze,  speed  to  that  place  where 
my  beloved  is  and,  having  caressed  her,  touch  me,  thus  causing 
me  the  same  delight  that  a  weary  traveller  experiences  when 
gazing  on  the  moon  !  That  which  consumes  my  limbs  as  though 
I  had  swallowed  poison,  is  the  cry  of  my  dear  one,  while  being 
borne  away,  *  Help,  O  Thou  who  art  my  defender ! '  With 
my  separation  from  her  as  the  coals  and  my  thoughts  of  her  as 
the  shimmering  flames,  the  fire  of  my  love  consumes  my  body 
day  and  night ! 

"  O  Lakshmana,  remain  here  while  I  plunge  into  the  sea  ere  I 
sleep,  so  that  the  fire  of  my  distress  shall  cease  from  tormenting 
me.  It  is  enough  that  she  and  I  sleep  on  the  same  earth.  As 
dry  land  draws  nourishment  for  its  vegetation  from  marshy 
ground,  so  do  I  exist  in  the  knowledge  that  Sita  still  lives ! 
O  When  shall  I,  having  overcome  mine  enemies,  behold  her 
of  graceful  limbs,  whose  eyes  resemble  lotus  petals,  the  equal 
of  Shri  herself  ?  When,  gently  raising  her  lotus-like  face  with 
its  ravishing  lips  and  teeth,  shall  I  drink  in  her  glances,  as  a  sick 
man  the  nectar  of  immortality  ?  When  will  that  playful  maiden 
embrace  me,  her  round  and  quivering  breasts  like  unto  Tala 

15 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

fruits  pressed  against  my  body,  like  sovereignty  united  with 
prosperity? 

"  Alas  !  Though  I  am  her  support,  that  dark-eyed  princess, 
who  has  fallen  among  the  titans,  resembles  an  orphan  !  How  can 
it  be  that  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  my  beloved,  is  now  in  the 
midst  of  titans,  she,  the  daughter-in-law  of  Dasaratha  ? 

"When  I  have  put  those  demons  to  flight,  Sita  will  live  anew 
as  the  autumnal  moon  shines  forth  again  when  the  clouds  are 
scattered.  By  nature  slender,  Sita,  on  account  of  grief,  fasting 
and  circumstance,  is  now  a  shadow  of  her  former  self. 

"  When,  with  my  shafts  piercing  the  breast  of  that  King  of 
Titans,  shall  I  empty  my  heart  of  sorrow  ?  When  shall  I 
behold  the  virtuous  Sita,  resembling  a  daughter  of  the  Gods, 
her  arms  encircling  my  neck,  shedding  tears  of  joy  ?  When, 
like  a  soiled  garment,  shall  I  discard  the  pain  born  of  my 
separation  from  Maithili  ?  " 

As  the  sagacious  Rama  was  thus  lamenting,  the  day  declined 
and  the  disc  of  the  sun,  diminishing  slowly,  disappeared  below 
the  horizon.  Thereupon  Rama,  whom  Lakshmana  sought  to 
console,  his  mind  still  engaged  in  the  thought  of  Sita,  whose 
eyes  were  as  large  as  lotus  petals,  distracted  by  grief,  performed 
his  evening  devotions. 


CHAPTER    6 

Ravana  consults  his  Subjects 

In  the  face  of  the  terrible  and  awe-inspiring  feat  executed  in 
Lanka  by  Hanuman  who  was  the  equal  of  Indra  in  prowess,  the 
King  of  the  Titans,  discomfited,  with  bowed  head  addressed 
his  subjects,  saying : — 

"  Lanka,  hitherto  inaccessible,  has  been  laid  waste  by  a  mere 
monkey  who  has  had  converse  with  the  daughter  of  Janaka, 
Sita.  Overthrowing  the  palaces  and  slaying  the  foremost  of 
the  titans,  he  has  turned  the  city  upside  down,  such  is  Hanuman's 
achievement!  What  should  I  do  now?  May  prosperity 
attend  you !  What  plan  do  you  consider  fitting  for  me  to 
16 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

adopt  first  ?    Say  what  you  hold  to  be  proper  for  us  to  do  and 
which  will  be  to  our  advantage ! 

"  The  wise  affirm  that  good  counsel  is  the  root  of  victory,  that 
is  why,  O  Brave  Ones,  I  desire  to  consult  you  concerning  Rama. 

*'  There  are  three  kinds  of  men  in  the  world,  the  good,  the  bad 
and  the  mediocre.  I  will  describe  the  qualities  and  defects  of 
them  all  to  you : — 

"  He,  who  in  his  deliberations  consults  experienced  counsellors, 
his  friends  with  whom  he  shares  common  interests,  his  relatives 
and  his  superiors  and  then  pursues  his  design  with  energy 
and  the  help  of  God,  is  considered  to  be  the  foremost  of  men. 

"  He,  who  enters  into  deliberation  and  pursues  his  duty  by 
himself  single-handedly,  accomplishing  that  which  should  be 
accomplished,  is  considered  a  mediocre  man. 

"  He,  who  fails  to  weigh  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  a 
matter  and  refuses  God's  aid,  merely  saying  *  I  shall  do  it ', 
disregards  his  duty  and  is  considered  the  least  of  men  1 

"  Just  as  there  are  always  those  who  are  superior,  those  who 
are  mediocre  and  those  who  are  inferior  among  men,  so  there 
exists  also  good,  bad  and  indifferent  counsel. 

"  That  judgement  which  is  given  after  a  clear-sighted  examina- 
tion of  the  question  and  to  which,  re-inforced  by  scriptural 
authority,  the  counsellors  agree,  is  considered  excellent. 

"Those  deliberations,  where  unanimity  is  finally  reached  after 
innumerable  discussions,  are  considered  mediocre,  and  those  in 
which  each  person  continues  to  stand  by  his  own  opinion  and 
opposes  those  of  others  and  where  no  conclusion  can  be  reached, 
are  considered  pernicious.  Therefore  an  undertaking  that 
follows  on  wise  deliberation  will  succeed. 

"  You,  who  are  all  eminently  sagacious,  must  decide  what 
should  be  done  and  I  will  subscribe  to  it.  Rama,  surrounded 
by  thousands  of  heroic  monkeys,  is  advancing  on  Lanka  to 
exterminate  us.  Undoubtedly  Raghava  will  cross  the  ocean  with 
ease  by  virtue  of  his  natural  powers  and  be  followed  by  his 
younger  brother  and  the  monkey  host.  He  is  able  to  dry  up 
the  sea  through  his  valour  or  he  may  use  some  other  means  (to 
bridge  the  ocean).  In  view  of  Rama's  attack  on  you  with  those 
monkeys,  do  you  devise  some  plan  to  protect  the  city  and  the 
army  1 "

CHAPTER    7 

The  Titans  persuade  Ravana  to  make  War  and  remind  him  of 
his  former  Exploits 

Hearing  the  words  of  Ravana,  their  lord  and  master,  all  those 
powerful  titans,  in  their  ignorance,  instilled  him  with  contempt 
for  the  enemy  and  with  joined  palms,  offered  him  ill-considered 
advice,  saying : — 

"  O  King,  we  possess  a  vast  army  furnished  with  maces, 
spears,  swords,  lances,  harpoons  and  barbed  darts,  why  art 
thou  apprehensive  ?  Didst  thou  not  enter  Bhogavati,  having 
overcome  the  Serpent  Race  in  war  ?  Didst  thou  not  subdue 
Dhanada,  who  inhabited  the  summit  of  Mt  Kailasha,  surrounded 
as  he  was  by  Yakshas,  creating  a  terrible  carnage  amongst  them  ? 
Though  he  regarded  himself  as  the  Lord  of  Men  and  prided 
himself  on  his  friendship  with  Mahadeva,  in  thy  wrath  thou 
didst  vanquish  him  on  the  field  of  battle. 

*'  O  Foremost  among  the  Titans,  Maya,  the  Lord  of  the  Danavas 
in  fear  gave  his  daughter  to  thee  in  wedlock  and  thou  didst 
also  subjugate  the  powerful  and  arrogant  giant,  Madhu,  the  joy 
of  Kumbhinasi!  Descending  into  the  nether  regions  thou 
didst  defeat  the  Serpents  Vasuki,  Takshaka,  Shankha  and 
Jati  despite  their  irresistible  power,  courage  and  the  boons 
conferred  on  them,  O  Lord  !  After  fighting  for  a  whole  year, 
confident  though  they  were  in  their  own  strength,  thou  didst 
force  them  to  submit  to  thy  yoke  and  learnt  the  science  of 
magic  from  them,  O  King  of  the  Titans,  Vanquisher  of  thyFoes! 
"  O  Great  Hero,  the  valiant  sons  of  Varuna  were  defeated  by 
thee  in  the  open  field  as  also  the  fourfold  army  attending  on 
them,  and  thou  didst  descend  into  the  vast  ocean,  that  dark 
region,  whose  sceptre  is  the  aquatic  world,  his  crown  the  Shalmali 
Tree,  bis  noose  the  great  billows,  his  serpents  the  attendants 
of  Yama,  who  is  irresistible  in  his  feverish  and  fearful  motion 
and  thou  didst  win  a  glorious  victory  there,  overcoming  Death 
and  rilling  all  thy  subjects  with  joy. 
18 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

The  earth  was  peopled  with  innumerable  and  valiant  warriors, 
equal  to  Indra  in  prowess,  resembling  giant  trees,  yet  thou 
didst  destroy  those  invincible  heroes  !  Raghava  is  neither 
their  equal  in  courage,  virtue  nor  in  might !  Yet  do  thou 
remain  here,  O  Great  King,  why  fatigue  thyself?  Indra jita  is 
able  to  exterminate  those  monkeys  single-handed.  That  prince, 
O  Great  Sovereign,  returning  from  a  sacrifice  to  Maheshwara, 
who  is  surpassed  by  none,  received  a  boon  from  him  not  easily 
obtainable  in  this  world  and,  approaching  that  divine  sea, 
whose  fish  are  lances  and  spears,  which  abounds  in  weapons 
for  its  trees,  whose  turtles  are  the  elephants  and  whose  frogs 
are  the  teeming  horses,  whose  cetaceans  are  the  Adityas  and 
Maruts,  its  great  serpents  the  Vasus,  its  waters  the  chariots, 
steeds  and  elephants,  the  sandy  banks  its  infantry,  that  vast 
ocean  of  the  Celestial  Hosts,  Indrajita  approached,  in  order  to 
bear  away  their  king  and  bring  him  to  Lanka.  Thereafter  that 
Monarch  was  liberated  by  the  command  of  the  Grandsire  of  the 
World  and  the  Vanquisher1  of  Shambara  and  Vritra  returned  to 
his  abode  where  all  the  Gods  paid  homage  to  him. 

"  Therefore  let  thy  son,  Indrajita,  go  forth  and  destroy  the 
army  of  the  monkeys  and  Rama  also,  O  King  ;  it  is  not  worthy 
of  thee  to  imagine  harm  can  come  from  common  persons,  such 
thoughts  should  not  even  enter  thy  mind  for  assuredly  thou 
shalt  bring  about  Rama's  end !  " 


CHAPTER    8 

The  boasting  of  Havana's  Generals 

Then  the  heroic  general,  the  Titan  Prahasta,  who  resembled 
a  dark  cloud,  joined  his  palms  together  and  expressed  himself 
thus:— 

**  We  are  able  to  overcome  the  Devas,  Danavas,  Gandharvas, 
Fisachas,  Patagas  and  Uragas  in  the  open  field,  how  much  more 
those  two  mortals  ! 

"  Under  the  influence  of  liquor  and  trusting  in  our  own  strength, 
we  suffered  ourselves  to  be  deceived  by  Hanuman  but  as  long  as 

1  Indra,  King  of  the  Goda.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

I  live,  that  ranger  of  the  woods  will  not  enter  here  again 
alive,  I  shall  sweep  the  land  surrounded  by  the  sea  clean  of 
monkeys  together  with  its  hills,  forests  and  jungles ;  thou  hast 
but  to  issue  the  command !  I  shall  rid  thee  of  that  monkey, 
O  Ranger  of  the  Night  and  thou  shalt  not  have  to  suffer  on 
account  of  thine  offence.1" 

Thereafter  Durmukha,  in  his  turn,  spoke  in  measured  tones, 
saying  :— 

"  Assuredly  we  shall  not  tolerate  this  outrage  that  he  has 
committed  against  us  all.  The  devastation  of  the  city  and  the 
palaces  and  the  insult  offered  to  our  sovereign  by  this  monkey 
shall  be  avenged  by  me.  Setting  out  alone,  I  shall  exterminate 
those  monkeys,  whether  they  have  taken  refuge  in  the  dreadful 
deep,  in  heaven  or  in  hell !  " 

Then  the  powerful  Vajradamshtra,  in  a  transport  of  rage, 
began  to  speak,  brandishing  a  huge  mace  stained  with  flesh  and 
blood,  and  said  : — 

**  What  is  that  puny  and  miserable  monkey,  Hanuman,  to  us 
as  long  as  the  mighty  Rama,  Sugriva  and  Lakshmana  exist? 
This  very  day,  I  shall  return,  having  slain  Rama,  Sugriva  and 
Lakshmana  single-handed  with  the  blows  of  my  mace  and 
routed  that  army  of  monkeys,  or,  if  it  pleaseth  thee,  hear  this 
further  plan  of  mine ;  he,  who  is  resourceful,  may  easily  over- 
come his  adversaries. 

"  Thousands  of  titans,  able  to  change  their  shape  at  will, 
courageous,  invincible,  of  terrifying  aspect,  are  devoted  to  thee. 
Let  them,  assuming  human  form,  present  themselves  before 
Kakutstha,  foremost  of  the  Raghus,  and,  full  of  confidence, 
say  to  him  : — 

" '  We  are  here  on  behalf  of  Bharata,  thy  younger  brother ', 
whereupon  Rama,  summoning  his  forces  will  instantly  come 
hither ;  then  armed  with  lances,  picks  and  maces,  carrying  bows, 
arrows  and  swords  in  our  hands,  we  will  set  out  with  speed  from 
here  and  meet  him.  Thereafter,  stationed  in  battalions  in  the 
air,  we  will  exterminate  that  army  of  monkeys  under  a  hail  of 
rocks  and  shafts  and  send  them  to  the  region  of  Yama.  Should 
they  fall  into  the  trap,  it  will  prove  disastrous  for  them  and  Rama 
and  Lakshmana  will  inevitably  lose  their  lives."

Then  the  son  of  Kumbhakarna,  the  valiant  and  powerful 
Nikumbha,  in  the  height  of  anger,  said  in  the  presence  of 
Ravana,  the  destroyer  of  the  worlds : — 

"  Let  all  of  you  remain  here  with  our  great  king ;  by  myself 
I  shall  slay  Raghava,  Lakshmana,  Sugriva  and  also  Hanuman 
and  all  the  monkeys." 

Thereafter  in  his  turn,  a  titan  named  Vajrabanu,  as  tall  as  a 
mountain,  who,  in  his  wrath,  was  licking  his  lips,  took  up  the 
tale,  saying : — 

"  Free  from  all  anxiety,  occupy  yourselves  with  those  things 
which  afford  you  entertainment,  single-handed  I  shall  consume 
the  entire  monkey  host.  Remain  here  at  ease  and  drink  wine1; 
alone  I  shall  slay  Sugriva,  Lakshmana  and  also  Hanuman, 
Angada  and  all  the  monkeys."

Bibishana   advises  Ravana   to   send  back   Sita 

The  Generals  Rabhasa,  the  mighty  Suryashatru,  Saptaghna, 
Yajnakopa  and  Mahaparshwa,  Mahodeva,  the  irrespressible 
Agnikctu  and  the  Titan  Rashiketu,  the  lusty  Indrashatu,  son  of 
Ravana,  also  Prahasta,  Vimpaksha  and  the  exceedingly  powerful 
Vajradamshtra,  Dhumraksha,  Nikumbha  and  the  Titan 
Durmukha,  brandishing  maces,  harpoons,  lances,  darts,  spears, 
axes,  bows  furnished  with  arrows  and  swords  shining  like  a 
great  expanse  of  water,  all  of  whom  were  blazing  with  anger 
addressed  Ravana  saying : — 

"  To-day  we  shall  slay  Rama,  Sugriva  and  Lakshmana  as 
also  that  wretch  Hanuman  who  laid  Lanka  waste !  ** 

Then  Bibishana,  restraining  those  who  had  seized  hold  of  their 
weapons,  persuaded  them  to  be  seated  and  spoke  thus  with 
joined  palms  :— 

"  My  Dear  Brother,  the  wise  affirm  that  when  the  end  which

when  force  should  be  employed  are  determined  by  the  tacticians. 
O  Friend,  deeds  of  valour  which  have  been  tested  according  to 
prescribed  injunctions,  succeed  against  those  who  are  careless 
when  attacked,  or  who  are  in  opposition  to  the  divine  power. 
Now,  Rama  is  on  his  guard,  he  is  eager  for  victory,  he  is  upheld 
by  divine  power,  he  has  subdued  his  passions  and  is  invincible, 
yet  you  seek  to  defeat  him. 

"  When  Hanuman  crossed  the  ocean,  that  formidable  Lord  of 
Streams  and  Rivers,  who  could  have  conceived  or  even  imagined 
the  path  he  would  take  ?  Our  adversary  has  immense  resources 
and  troops  at  his  disposal  O  Rangers  of  the  Night,  you  should 
in  no  way  disregard  him !  What  wrong  has  the  illustrious 
Rama  ever  done  to  the  King  of  the  Titans  that  he  should  go  to 
Janasthana  and  bear  away  the  consort  of  that  great  One  ? 

"  If  Khara,  who  had  trespassed  into  a  region  that  was  not  his 
own,  was  slain  in  combat  by  Rama,  is  it  not  legitimate  for  every- 
one to  defend  his  life  ?  It  is  on  account  of  Vaidehi's  abduction 
that  we  are  in  this  great  peril  and  we  should  therefore  yield  her 
up.  What  advantage  is  there  in  continuing  the  quarrel  ?  Nay, 
it  is  not  proper  to  enter  into  hostilities  with  that  powerful  and 
virtuous  prince,  who  would  never  initiate  warfare  without  a 
definite  cause.  Therefore  do  you  give  back  Maithili  to  him  ere 
he,  by  means  of  his  arrows,  destroys  this  city  abounding  in 
wealth  of  every  kind  with  its  horses  and  elephants !  Before 
that  formidable  and  mighty  monkey  host  attack  this,  our  Lanka, 
do  you  give  back  Sita.  Lanka  with  all  her  heroic  titans  will 
perish  unless  the  beloved  consort  of  Rama  is  voluntarily 
returned  to  him. 

"I  adjure  you  by  the  blood  that  unites  us  to  follow  my  counsel, 
which  is  salutory.  Return  Maithili  to  Rama  ere  he  looses  his 
shafts  for  your  destruction,  which  are  freshly  sharpened,  steely, 
infallible,  plumed  and  bright  as  the  autumnal  sun.  Give  back 
Maithili  to  the  son  of  Dasaratha  without  delay ;  renounce  a 
resentment  which  destroys  all  felicity  and  virtue  and  pursue 
righteousness  which  increases  well-being  and  glory.  Be 
pacified,  that  we  may  live  in  tranquillity  with  our  sons  and 
kinsfolk.    Give  back  Maithili  to  Dasaratha's  son  !  " 

Thus  spoke  Bibishana,  and  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans, 
dismissing  them  all,  entered  his  private  apartments. 


YVDDHA    KASDA 

CHAPTER    10 

Bibishana  insists  that  Sita  should  be  given  back  to  Rama 

As  the  day  dawned,  Bibishana,  renowned  for  his  exploits,  fixed 
in  the  knowledge  of  what  was  just  and  profitable,  entered  the 
palace  of  the  King  of  the  Titans  which  resembled  a  mass  of 
crags  like  unto  the  peak  of  a  mountain.  That  vast  area  was  the 
resort  of  the  great ;  well  ordered  and  divided,  it  was  inhabited 
by  learned  persons  and  guarded  by  loyal  and  vigilant  titans  on 
all  sides.  Re-echoing  to  the  sound  of  the  wind  blended  with 
the  trumpeting  of  intoxicated  elephants,  the  blare  of  conches 
and  the  blasts  of  trumpets,  groups  of  lovely  girls  filled  the  alleys 
with  their  chattering.  Its  gates  were  of  pure  gold  enriched 
by  magnificent  decorations  resembling  the  abode  of  the  Gan- 
dharvas  or  the  mansions  of  the  Maruts,  and  it  contained  heaps  of 
gems  like  unto  the  Serpents1  dwellings. 

Then  that  One  of  exceeding  energy  and  renown  entered  the 
palace  of  his  elder  brother,  as  the  sun  of  sparkling  rays  enters 
a  cloud,  and  he  heard  the  blessings  invoked  on  his  brother  for 
his  victory  uttered  in  a  loud  voice  by  those  versed  in  the  Veda. 
And  he  beheld  those  priests  instructed  in  the  science  of 
*  Mantras  *  and  the  Veda,  worshipped  with  vessels  of  curds, 
clarified  butter,  flowers  and  hulled  rice.  Thereafter  the  mighty- 
armed  Bibishana,  duly  honoured  by  the  titans,  observed  the 
younger  brother  of  the  Bestower  of  Riches*,  who  was  seated  there. 

Approaching  the  throne  that  was  covered  with  gold, 
embellished  by  the  person  of  the  king,  he  paid  homage,  extending 
fitting  courtesies  to  him  and  took  the  seat  indicated  by  Ravana's 
glance.  Thereafter  he  addressed  the  mighty  Dashagriva  in  the 
presence  of  his  ministers  alone  and,  standing  before  him,  with 
soothing  speech  sought  to  pacify  him,  manifesting  his  knowledge 
of  time  and  place,  and  expressed  himself  thus  : — 

"  O  Subduer  of  thy  Foes,  ever  since  Vaidehi  was  brought 
here,  inauspicious  omens  have  been  observed  !  The  sacrificial 
fire  emits  sparks  and  its  brightness  is  dimmed  by  smoke; 

1  Serpents,  the  Nagas  or  the  Serpent  Race.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

impure  vapours  arise  therefrom  even  after  the  oblations  have 
been  poured  to  the  accompaniment  of  sacred  formulas  nor  does 
it  burn  in  a  proper  manner.  In  the  kitchens,  sacred  pavilions 
and  the  halls,  where  the  Vedas  are  recited,  reptiles  are  to  be 
found  and  ants  are  discovered  in  the  sacrificial  offerings.  The 
milk  of  the  kiiie  has  dried  up,  ichor  no  longer  flows  from  the 
strongest  of  the  elephants,  horses  find  no  satisfaction  in  their 
fodder  and  neigh  incessantly,  while  the  asses,  buffalo  and 
mules,  their  hair  standing  on  end,  shed  tears,  and,  though 
ministered  to  by  experts,  do  not  behave  normally,  O  King. 

"  Fierce  crows  gather  together  from  all  sides,  emitting  harsh 
cries  and  are  seen  swarming  on  the  roofs  of  the  temples. 
Vultures  plane  mournfully  over  the  city  and  at  dusk,  jackals 
appear  howling  lugubriously.  Wild  beasts  and  deer  assemble 
at  the  gates  of  the  city,  setting  up  an  ominous  noise  to  the 
accompaniment  of  growls.  These  omens  indicate  that  thy 
fault  should  be  expiated  as  the  Lord  thinks  proper  by  returning 
Vaidehi  to  Raghava. 

"  If,  through  error  or  expediency,  I  have  given  cause  for 
offence,  thou  shouldst  not  condemn  me,  O  Great  Monarch! 
All  thy  people,  both  male  and  female  and  thy  court  affirm  that 
the  fault  is  thine  !  It  is  through  fear  that  thy  ministers  dare 
not  counsel  thee  but  I  feel  compelled  to  inform  thee  of  what  I 
have  seen  and  heard.  Judge  what  thou  considerest  to  be  right 
and  act  accordingly." 

Thus  spoke  Bibishana  in  measured  words  to  his  brother, 
Ravana,  Lord  of  the  Titans,  in  the  presence  of  the  ministers, 
and,  hearing  that  judicious,  reasonable,  moderate  and  logical 
speech,  productive  of  great  good  for  the  past,  present  and  future, 
Ravana,  who  had  conceived  a  passion  for  Sita,  answered  with 
mounting  anger,  saying : — 

"  I  see  no  cause  for  fear  anywhere !  Rama  shall  never  regain 
Maithili !  Even  were  Lakshmana's  elder  brother  upheld  by  the 
Gods  with  Indra  at  their  head,  how  could  he  withstand  me  in 
the  field  ?  " 

Having  spoken  thus,  that  destroyer  of  Celestial  Hosts, 
Dashagriva,  who  was  endowed  with  terrific  strength  and  extreme 
prowess  in  combat,  dismissed  his  brother  Bibishana  of  frank 
speech.

Chapter   i  i 

Ravana  summons  his  Assembly 

That  unrighteous  monarch,  a  slave  to  his  passion,  disregarding 
his  real  friends,  in  consequence  of  his  evil  act  began  to  suffer 
decrease. 

His  lustful  desire  exceeding  all  bounds,  bis  thoughts  con- 
stantly occupied  with  Vaidehi,  though  the  occasion  for  war  was 
lacking,  with  his  ministers  conceived  that  the  time  for  entering 
into  hostilities  had  come.  Thereupon,  sallying  forth,  he 
ascended  his  mighty  chariot  plated  with  gold,  encrusted  with 
coral  and  pearl  and  harnessed  to  well-trained  horses.  Seated 
in  that  excellent  car,  which  reverberated  like  thunder, 
Dashagriva,  the  foremost  of  titans  drove  to  the  place  of 
assembly. 

Titans  with  swords,  bucklers  and  every  kind  of  weapon 
preceded  their  king  on  the  highway,  some  garbed  in  strange 
attire  covered  with  every  kind  of  gem  marched  at  his  side  or 
followed  in  his  wake,  and  they  surrounded  him  on  all  sides. 
The  foremost  of  the  car-warriors  speedily  precipitated  them- 
selves in  his  vanguard  with  their  chariots  or  on  great  elephants 
intoxicated  with  Mada  juice  or  horses  which  they  caused  to 
rear.  Brandishing  maces  and  crowbars,  they  held  picks  and 
darts  in  their  hands. 

As  Ravana  approached  the  assembly,  the  sound  of  innumerable 
musical  instruments  could  be  heard  and  the  blare  of  trumpets 
broke  forth  to  the  accompaniment  of  the  rolling  of  vehicles 
whilst  the  great  chariot  of  that  Indra  of  Demons  passed  along 
the  splendidly  decorated  highway.  The  canopy,  that  was  held 
over  his  head,  shone  with  an  immaculate  purity,  resembling  the 
king  of  the  stars  at  his  full,  and  two  fans  of  Yaks  tails  with 
crystal  handles  and  golden  fringes  were  waved  to  and  fro  from 
left  to  right.  All  the  titans  having  alighted,  stood  with  joined 
palms  and  bowed  heads  in  homage  to  their  king  who  was  seated 
in  his  car. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Amidst  acclamations  and  cries  of  triumph  from  those  titans, 
that  scourger  of  his  foes  made  his  solemn  entry  into  the  assembly 
hall  that  had  been  constructed  by  Vishvakarma. 

The  floor  was  of  refined  gold  and  six  hundred  evil  spirits 
guarded  it.  Into  that  excellent  audience  hall,  a  masterpiece  of 
Vishvakarma,  Ravana  made  his  entry  sparkling  with  magnifi- 
cence and  seated  himself  on  a  gorgeous  throne  wrought  of 
emeralds,  carpeted  with  skins  of  deer  and  furnished  with  thick 
cushions. 

Thereupon  he  issued  his  orders  imperiously  to  exceedingly 
fleet  messengers,  saying : — 

"  Summon  the  titans  hither  with  all  speed ! "  thereafter 
adding,  "  A  great  blow  is  about  to  be  struck  by  the  enemy  !  " 

Hearing  this  command,  his  envoys  dispersed  to  search 
throughout  Lanka,  entering  every  house  and  scouring  the  high- 
ways and  pleasure  resorts,  assembling  the  titans  without 
ceremony.  Some  started  out  in  excellent  chariots,  some  on 
swift  and  mettlesome  horses  or  elephants  and  some  on  foot. 
The  city  was  thronged  with  cars,  elephants  and  horses  and 
resembled  the  sky  filled  with  birds. 

Then  they  abandoned  their  mounts  and  chariots  of  every  kind 
in  order  to  enter  the  audience  chamber  and  they  resembled  lions 
penetrating  into  a  rocky  cavern. 

Having,  each  in  turn,  paid  homage  to  the  feet  of  the  king, 
they  took  up  their  positions,  some  on  seats,  some  on  cushions, 
some  on  the  ground,  and  gathering  in  that  hall  at  his  command 
they  grouped  themselves  according  to  rank  round  their  sovereign, 
the  Lord  of  the  Titans. 

They  came  in  hundreds;  ministers  distinguished  for  their 
skill  in  dealing  with  affairs  and  talented  sagacious  counsellors 
able  to  view  all  with  the  eye  of  understanding ;  warriors  also  in 
great  numbers  gathered  in  the  hall  that  sparkled  with  gold,  in 
order  to  prepare  for  the  success  of  their  campaign. 

At  that  moment,  arriving  in  a  magnificent  chariot,  its  various 
parts  encrusted  with  gold,  Bibishana  appeared  in  the  assembly 
presided  over  by  his  elder  brother  and,  announcing  himself  by 
name,  he  paid  obeisance  to  the  feet  of  the  king,  whereafter 
Shuka  and  Frahasta,  in  their  turn,  did  homage  to  that  monarch, 
who  conferred  special  places  upon  them  befitting  their  rank. 
36 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

The  titans  were  adorned  with  fine  gold  and  every  kind  of 
ornament,  arrayed  in  rich  vestures,  and  the  fragrance  of  aloes 
and  rare  sandalwood  from  their  garlands  perfumed  the  hall  on 
every  side. 

Neither  harsh  accents  nor  ill-advised  utterances  nor  loud 
whisperings  could  be  heard  in  the  assembly  and,  their  desires 
crowned,  all  those  titans  of  extreme  prowess  fixed  their  eyes 
on  the  face  of  their  sovereign. 

In  the  midst  of  those  skilled  warriors  full  of  energy,  the 
intelligent  Ravana  appeared  resplendent  in  that  assembly  like 
unto  the  God  with  the  Thunderbolt  amongst  the  Vasus. 


Chapter   i  2 

The  Discourse  between  Ravana  and  Kumbhakarna 

Then  Ravana,  the  conqueror  of  hostile  armies,  let  his  gaze 
wander  over  the  assembly  and  addressing  himself  to  the  General 
of  his  forces,  Prahasta,  said : — 

"  O  General,  it  is  for  thee,  who  art  conversant  with  the  four 
branches  of  strategy,  to  dispose  of  thy  forces  in  the  way  that  the 
defence  of  the  city  demands."1 

Thereupon  Prahasta,  alert  to  his  sovereign's  behests  and  eager 
to  carry  them  out,  distributed  the  whole  of  his  troops  within  and 
without  the  fortress  and,  having  disposed  of  his  entire  army  in 
the  city's  defence,  he  returned  to  his  seat  in  front  of  the  king 
and  said : — 

"  O  Mighty  Lord,  I  have  stationed  thy  forces  within  and 
without  the  city,  now  accomplish  that  which  thou  hast  resolved 
to  do  speedily  and  without  anxiety  !  " 

At  these  words  of  Prahasta's,  that  monarch,  who  aspired  to 
happiness  and  who  was  devoted  to  the  public  welfare,  expressed 
himself  thus  amidst  his  followers  : — 

"  Should  duty,  pleasure  or  self-interest  endanger  whatever  is 
pleasant  or  unpleasant,  whether  it  be  in  prosperity  or  adversity,

gain  or  loss,  whether  useful  or  disadvantageous,  you  are  bound 
to  point  it  out.  No  undertaking  of  mine,  that  I  have  engaged 
in  with  you,  re-inforced  by  the  recitation  of  sacred  formulas, 
has  ever  proved  fruitless  !  As  the  Maruts,  the  moon,  the  stars 
and  the  planets  follow  in  Vasava's  wake,  so  do  you  all  follow 
me  in  a  splendid  procession  assuring  me  of  victory ! 

"In  truth  I  intended  to  mobilize  you  all  but,  on  account  of 
Kumbhakarna  being  asleep,  I  have  not  pressed  this  matter ! 
After  sleeping  for  six  months,  the  foremost  of  those  bearing 
arms,  has  just  risen.  As  regards  the  beloved  consort  of  Rama, 
the  daughter  of  Janaka,  I  brought  her  here  from  the  solitudes  of 
the  Dandaka  Forest  which  is  frequented  by  titans.  That  princess 
of  languid  pace  does  not  wish  to  share  my  bed,  though  in  the 
Three  Worlds,  I  see  none  to  compare  with  her.  Slender- 
waisted,  with  well  developed  hips,  her  countenance  resembling 
the  autumnal  moon,  she  is  like  an  image  made  of  gold  created 
by  Maya.1  Her  palms  are  rosy,  her  feet  are  delicate  and  well 
set,  her  nails  coppery  and,  seeing  her,  I  am  overcome  with  desire. 
Shining  like  the  flame  of  the  sacrificial  fire  she  rivals  the  bright- 
ness of  the  sun ;  her  face  with  its  arched  nose  is  flawless  and 
fair,  her  eyes  beautiful.  On  beholding  her  I  am  no  longer 
master  of  myself  and  become  the  slave  of  love.  Torn  between 
anger  and  delight,  this  passion  has  proved  my  undoing,  the 
cause  of  ruin  and  the  eternal  source  of  pain  and  suffering.  In 
anticipation  of  the  advent  of  her  lord,  Rama,  that  lovely  large- 
eyed  lady  has  solicited  a  year's  grace  of  me  and  I  have  looked 
with  favour  on  the  request  of  that  one  of  tender  glances  but, 
like  unto  a  spent  steed  on  the  highway,  I  am  weary  of  the  pricks 
of  passion. 

"  How  will  those  inhabitants  of  the  woods  cross  the  impassable 
ocean  with  the  innumerable  monsters  that  inhabit  it  and  how 
can  those  two  sons  of  Dasaratha  traverse  it  ?  The  outcome  of 
this  enterprise  is  impossible  to  predict.  Say  what  you  think 
in  this  matter!  A  mere  man  causes  no  apprehension;  yet 
ponder  on  it  carefully  I 

"  Formerly,  in  the  war  between  Gods  and  Titans,  thanks  to 
your  support  I  was  victorious  and  you  are  still  ready  to  stand 
by  me.

"  Having  ascertained  where  Sita  is,  those  two  princes,  preceded 
by  the  monkeys  with  Sugriva  at  their  head,  have  reached  the 
shores  of  the  sea.  It  is  not  fox  us  to  return  Sita  but  to  destroy 
the  two  sons  of  Dasaratha,  therefore  deliberate  on  this  and  adopt 
a  judicious  line  of  conduct.  In  truth,  I  know  of  none  in  the 
world  who  can  overcome  us,  even  should  he  cross  the  water 
with  the  monkeys ;  victory  is  therefore  indubitably  mine." 

Hearing  the  ramblings  of  that  bashful  lover,  Kumbhakarna 
flew  into  a  transport  of  rage  and  said  : — 

"  On  first  seeing  Sita,  the  consort  of  Rama,  who  is  accom- 
panied by  Lakshmana,  she  who  was  brought  here  by  force,  thy 
mind  was  wholly  possessed  by  her  as  the  waters  of  the  lake  are 
rilled  by  the  Yamuna.  O  Great  King,  this  conduct  is  not 
worthy  of  thee  !  Thou  shouldst  have  consulted  us  at  the  outset 
of  this  affair.  The  king  who  acquits  himself  of  his  obligations 
punctiliously,  O  Ten-faced  One,  and  whose  mind  is  concen- 
trated on  what  he  is  about,  has  not  to  repent  later !  Those 
undertakings  that  are  carried  out  carelessly  and  against  the 
scriptural  law  turn  out  badly,  like  unto  impure  offerings  poured 
into  the  sacrificial  fire  by  those  who  are  heedless.  To  seek  to 
end  where  one  should  begin  or  to  begin  where  one  should 
conclude  is  to  ignore  what  is  proper  and  what  is  not.  If  an 
adversary  examines  the  defects  of  one  who  is  unrestrained,  he 
soon  discovers  his  weak  points,  as  birds  the  fissures  in  the 
Krauncha  Mountains.  Thou  didst  make  this  assault  without 
forethought  and  it  is  fortunate  that  Rama  did  not  slay  thee,  as 
poisoned  food  the  eater  thereof !  Nevertheless  I  shall  do  my 
part  in  this  campaign  that  thou  dost  contemplate  launching 
against  thine  enemies,  O  Irreproachable  One  !  I  shall  destroy 
thine  adversaries,  O  Ranger  of  the  Night,  even  as  India, 
Vivasvat,  Pavaka,  Maruta,  Kuvera  or  Varuna  themselves,  I 
shall  fight  against  them ! 

**  Entering  the  combat  with  my  enormous  body,  the  size  of  a 
mountain  and  my  sharp  teeth,  roaring  the  while  and  brandishing 
my  immense  mace,  I  shall  strike  terror  into  Furandara  himself ! 

"  Ere  the  foe  can  deliver  a  second  blow,  I  shall  drink  his  blood, 

therefore  take  comfort,  for  by  slaying  Dasaratha's  son  I  shall 

bring  thee  an  auspicious  victory  !    Having  destroyed  Rama  as 

also  Lakshmana,  I  shall  devour  all  the  monkey  leaders  !    Enjoy

thyself  therefore  and  drink  the  most  excellent  of  wines  to  the 
extent  of  thy  desire  without  anxiety ;  do  what  thou  judgest  to 
behest! 

"When  I  have  despatched  Rama  to  the  region  of  death, 
Sita  will  be  at  thy  disposal  for  ever." 


Chapter   13 

Ravana  tells  the  Story  of  the  Nymph  Pumikasthala 

Seeing  Ravana  wrought  up  with  ire,  the  mighty  General 
Mahaparshwa  reflected  a  moment  and,  with  joined  palms,  spoke 
thus: — 

"  He  who,  having  penetrated  into  a  wood  frequented  by  wild 
beasts  and  serpents,  does  not  partake  of  the  honey  he  finds  there, 
is  a  fool ! 

"  Who  is  thy  master  ?  Thou  art  the  master,  O  Scourge  of  Thy 
Foes  !  Enjoy  thyself  with  Vaidehi,  having  placed  thy  foot  on 
the  head  of  thy  foe  !  Act  in  the  manner  of  a  cock,  O  Valiant 
Prince  !  Approach  Sita  again  and  again  in  order  to  enjoy  her 
and  pass  the  time  in  dalliance  with  her.  Having  sated  thy 
passion,  what  is  there  to  fear  ?  Whether  taken  unawares  or  no, 
thou  art  well  able  to  meet  every  exigency  !  Without  support 
Kumbhakarna  and  Indrajita  of  immense  energy,  would  be 
capable  of  challenging  the  God  who  bears  the  Thunderbolt 
armed  with  his  mace  ! 

"Bestowal  of  gifts,  conciliation  and  sowing  dissension  in  the 
ranks  of  the  enemy  are  the  means  of  subduing  them,  according 
to  the  wise,  but  in  the  present  circumstances,  I  incline  to  the  use 
of  the  fourth !  O  Lord,  we  shall  subdue  thy  foes  by  the  strength 
of  our  arms,  do  not  doubt  it !  " 

Thus  spoke  Mahaparshwa  and  the  king,  thanking  him, 
replied  thus : — 

"  O  Mahaparshwa,  I  will  answer  thee  by  recounting  a  strange 
adventure  that  befell  me  a  long  time  ago. 

"  While  she  was  going  to  worship  the  Grandsire  of  the  World, 
I  came  upon  the  nymph,  Punjikasthala,  hashing  through  the  sky 
30 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

like  a  flame.  I  stripped  her  of  her  attire  in  order  to  deflower 
her,  after  which  like  a  faded  lotus  she  reached  the  abode  of 
Swyambhu.  The  magnanimous  Ordainer  of  the  World, 
learning  of  the  matter,  addressed  me  in  anger,  saying : — 

" '  O  Ravana,  from  to-day,  if  thou  dost  violence  to  any  other 
woman,  thy  head  will  be  split  into  a  hundred  pieces,  this  is 
certain! ' 

"This  curse  alarmed  me  and  it  is  for  this  reason  that  I  have  not 
forced  Sita,  the  Princess  of  Videha,  to  ascend  the  nuptual  couch. 
My  fury  is  like  unto  the  sea  and  my  speed  resembles  the  wind 
but  the  son  of  Dasaratha  is  unaware  of  it  and  it  is  on  this  account 
he  has  set  out  to  fight  me.  Who  would  seek  to  waken  a  lion 
lying  asleep  in  a  hidden  mountain  den  whose  anger  resembles 
the  God  of  Death  himself  ? 

"  Ramachandra  has  not  seen  my  arrows  in  combat  that  resemble 
snakes  with  forked  tongues,  wherefore  he  is  considering 
marching  against  me.  From  my  bow,  loosing  my  shafts  that 
are  like  unto  lightning  on  him  from  a  myriad  sides,  I  shall 
speedily  consume  Rama,  as  a  forest  is  set  on  fire  by  flaming 
brands.  I  shall  wipe  out  his  army  with  mine,  as  the  rising  sun 
blots  out  the  light  of  the  stars.  Neither  Vasava  of  a  thousand 
eyes  nor  Varuna  can  withstand  me  in  battle !  It  was  by  the 
strength  of  mine  arms  that  I  conquered  the  city  defended  by 
Kuvera ! " 


Chapter  14 

Bibishana  blames  the  Attitude  of  Ravana' 's  Courtiers 

Prince  Bibishana  listened  to  the  boasting  of  Ravana  and  the 
thundering  of  Kumbhakarna  and  addressed  the  king  in  words 
that  were  profitable  and  sagacious,  saying : — 

"  O  King,  why  hast  thou  brought  that  great  serpent  in  the 
form  of  Sita  hither,  her  breasts  its  coils,  her  anxieties  its  poison, 
her  laughter  its  sharp  fangs,  her  five  fingers  its  five  hoods  ? 
While  Lanka  is  yet  not  assailed  by  those  monkeys,  armed  with 
their  teeth  and  nails,  who  are  as  high  as  hills,  give  back  Maithili 
to  the  son  of  Dasaratha  ! 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"Neither  Kumbhakarna  nor  Indrajita,  O  King,  neither 
Mahaparshwa  nor  Mahodara  neither  Nikumbha  nor  Kumbha 
nor  yet  Atikaya  are  able  to  withstand  Rama  on  the  field  of  battle ! 
Thou  wouldst  never  escape  from  Rama  alive  even  wert  thou 
protected  by  Savitar  or  the  Maruts  or  if  thou  didst  take  refuge 
in  the  region  of  Yama  or  plunge  into  the  lowest  hell !  " 

Thus  spoke  Bibishana  and  Prahasta  answered  him  saying  : — 

"  We  do  not  know  what  it  is  to  fear  the  Gods  or  titans  whoever 
they  may  be,  nor  do  we  stand  in  awe  of  Yakshas,  Gandharvas 
nor  great  Serpents,  gigantic  birds  nor  great  snakes  in  the  field. 
Why  then  should  we  tremble  to  enter  into  combat  with  Rama, 
that  son  of  a  mortal  king  ?  " 

Hearing  this  injudicious  speech  of  Prahasta's,  Bibishana,  who 
sought  to  save  the  king  and  whose  intellect  was  rooted  in  the 
values  of  virtue,  profit  and  expediency,  uttered  these  words  full 
of  good  sense,  saying : — 

"  O  Prahasta,  the  intrigues  proposed  by  the  King,  Mahodara, 
thee  and  Kumbhakarna  against  me,  born  with  qualities  such  as 
Rama  possesses  are  as  unlikely  to  succeed  as  the  entry  into 
heaven  of  one  of  perverse  soul.  It  is  impossible  for  me  or  thee 
or  Prahasta  or  all  the  titans  to  slay  Rama,  who  is  supremely 
experienced.  It  is  as  if  we  sought  to  cross  the  sea  without  a 
boat !  In  the  presence  of  such  a  hero,  essentially  pious,  that 
Prince  of  the  Great  Car,  the  issue  of  the  Ikshvaku  Race  who  is 
capable  of  any  exploit,  even  the  Gods  themselves  are  con- 
founded !  It  is  because  those  sharp  arrows,  irresistible  and 
furnished  with  heron's  plumes,  that  are  loosed  by  Raghava, 
have  not  as  yet  pierced  thy  limbs,  that  thou  art  still  able  to 
boast,  O  Prahasta  !  It  is  because  those  pointed  shafts  that  Rama 
discharges,  which  quench  the  vital  breaths  and  are  equal  to  the 
lightning  in  their  velocity,  have  not  penetrated  thy  body,  that 
thou  dost  still  bluster  in  this  wise !  Neither  Ravana  nor  the 
exceedingly  powerful  Trishiras  nor  the  son  of  Kumbhakarna, 
Nikumbha  nor  Indrajita,  nor  even  thou  thyself,  are  able  to 
overcome  the  son  of  Dasaratha  in  combat,  who  is  equal  to  Indra 
himself.  Neither  Devantaka  nor  Narantaka,  neither  Akampana, 
the  magnanimous  Atiratha  nor  Atikaya  are  capable  of  resisting 
Raghava  in  battle. 

"  You,  the  friends  of  this  monarch  who  is  dominated  by  passion, 
32 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

violent  by  nature  and  whose  acts  are  thoughtless,  flatter  him,  as 
though  you  were  his  foes,  to  the  destruction  of  the  titans ! 
Rescue  and  deliver  that  king  who  is  held  fast  in  the  illimitable 
coils  of  a  serpent  possessed  of  a  thousand  hoods  and  who  is 
formidable  and  of  exceeding  energy.  It  is  for  the  sovereign's 
friends,  whose  desires  have  been  gratified  by  him,  to  save  him, 
even  were  it  by  dragging  him  by  the  hair  of  his  head,  like  one 
who  has  fallen  a  prey  to  fiends  of  immeasurable  power.  It  is 
for  you  unitedly  to  rescue  that  monarch  from  the  surging  waters 
of  the  ocean  Rama,  he  who  is  sinking  into  the  mouth  of  the 
Kakutstha  hell ! 

"  I  will  here  repeat  those  words  that  are  to  the  advantage  of 
the  city,  the  titans,  the  king  and  the  host  of  courtiers  !  I  repeat 
them  loyally  and  candidly  '  Let  Maithili  be  given  back  to  that 
Prince! ' 

"  He  who,  having  estimated  the  strength  of  his  foes,  his  own 
resources,  the  situation  and  the  loss  and  gain  of  his  undertaking 
and,  after  mature  reflection,  expresses  himself  frankly  and 
judiciously  to  his  master,  is  a  true  counsellor." 


Chapter   15 

Bibishana  reproaches  Indrajita  for  his  boasting 

This  speech  of  Bibishana's,  who  was  equal  to  Brihaspati  in 
wisdom,  displeased  the  great  Indrajita,  Leader  of  the  Nairrita 
Hosts,  who  replied  to  him  thus : — 

**  What  do  these  idle  words  fraught  with  fear  signify,  O 
Youngest  of  my  Uncles  ?  None  other,  even  were  he  the  issue 
of  another  race  than  our  own,  would  speak  thus  or  even  conceive 
such  thoughts !  Valour,  courage,  endurance,  steadfastness, 
audacity  and  strength  are  lacking  in  Bibishana  alone,  the 
youngest  brother  of  my  sire. 

"  Who  are,  in  fact,  these  two  sons  of  a  king  of  men?    One  of 

us  single-handed,  were  he  the  least  of  the  titans,  would  suffice 

to  exterminate  them  both !    O  Coward,  from  whence  springs 

thy  fear  ?    Was  I  not  able  to  cast  the  Protector  of  the  Three 

33 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Worlds  to  the  ground,  the  Lord  of  the  Devas  himself?  Struck 
with  terror,  the  Hosts  of  the  Gods  scattered  in  all  directions  and 
the  loudly  trumpeting  Airavata  was  brought  down  by  me,  whose 
tusks  I  rooted  out,  dispersing  the  celestial  armies  by  my  valour. 
I  who  humbled  the  pride  of  the  Gods  themselves  and  afflicted 
the  Daityas,  am  I  in  mine  immeasurable  energy  not  able  to 
subdue  these  two  princes,  insignificant  mortals  as  they  are  ?  " 

At  this  speech  of  that  invincible  and  powerful  rival  of  Indra, 
Bibishana  the  foremost  of  warriors  answered  him  in  words 
fraught  with  good  sense,  saying : — 

"  My  Child,  thy  reflections  are  worthless  !  Thou  art  young 
and  thine  intellect  is  not  yet  ripe ;  further,  to  our  ruin,  thou  art 
incapable  of  ascertaining  what  is  expedient  and  inexpedient. 

"Under  the  guise  of  a  son,  O  Indrajita,  thou  art  in  truth  a 
hidden  foe  to  Ravana  and,  hearing  him  prate  of  slaying  Raghava, 
thou  dost  support  him.  Thou  dost  merit  death,  as  also  he  who 
had  the  grievous  idea  of  bringing  thee  here  this  day  and  intro- 
ducing a  youthful,  rash  and  arrogant  warrior  into  an  assembly  of 
counsellors  !  O  Indrajita,  thou  art  thoughtless,  imprudent, 
feeble  of  intellect,  thy  mind  ruined  by  folly  and  extreme  frivolity 
and  thou  speakest  thus  from  childishness.  Who  can  withstand 
the  shock  of  those  shining  arrows  which  Raghava  looses  in 
combat  resembling  the  Rod  of  Brahma,  like  unto  fate  or  the 
Sceptre  of  Yama?  Do  thou  give  back  Sita  to  Rama  with 
treasure,  pearls,  rich  ornaments,  celestial  attire  and  gems,  so 
that  we  may  dwell  here  without  anxiety,  O  King." 


Chapter   16 

Ravana  rebukes  Bibishana  who  takes  his  Departure 

Bibishana,  having  uttered  these  words  that  were  reasoned  and 
full  of  good  sense,  Ravana  replied  in  harsh  accents,  saying : — 
"  It  were  better  to  live  as  a  declared  enemy  or  with  a  venomous 
serpent  than  to  dwell  with  one  who,  under  the  guise  of  a  friend, 
is  in  league  with  the  foe.  The  disposition  of  relatives  who  ever 
rejoice  in  others'  misfortunes  is  well  known,  O  Titan.  Kinsfolk 
34 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

ever  seek  to  bring  down  the  one  who  is  endowed  with  authority, 
energy,  learning  and  loyalty  and,  should  he  be  a  hero,  he  is  the 
more  condemned  by  them.  Constantly  finding  delight  in  the 
discomfiture  of  one  another,  their  bows  ready  to  strike  each 
other  down,  their  hearts  full  of  deceit,  they  are  both  formidable 
and  dangerous. 

"  Those  verses  formerly  recited  by  the  elephants  in  the  Padma 
Forest,  on  seeing  men  with  snares  in  their  hands,  are  well  known ; 
I  will  repeat  them  to  thee : — *  Neither  fire  nor  weapons  nor 
traps  strike  terror  into  us  but  those  of  our  own  kind  who  are 
cruel  and  self-interested,  it  is  they  whom  we  fear !  They  alone, 
undoubtedly  divulge  the  means  of  making  us  captive !  * 

"  Of  all  perils,  those  that  spring  from  relatives  are  the  worst, 
this  is  known  to  us.  From  cows  we  have  milk,  from  relatives 
malice,  from  women  capriciousness,  from  brahmins  asceticism. 
That  I  am  held  in  honour  by  my  subjects  and  have  been  called 
to  rule  over  an  empire  by  descent  and  have  set  my  foot  on  the 
heads  of  mine  enemies,  will  certainly  not  have  found  favour 
with  thee  !  As  drops  of  water  are  unable  to  remain  on  the  lotus 
leaves,  so  does  friendship  slip  from  the  hold  of  worthless  persons. 
As  in  autumn  the  thunderclouds,  which  empty  themselves,  fail 
to  saturate  the  earth,  so  does  friendship  fail  with  the  vicious.  As 
bees  fly  away  after  they  have  sucked  out  the  honey  they  have 
found,  so  do  the  unworthy  relinquish  a  friendship  after  it  has 
served  their  purpose.  As  the  honey  stealer  in  its  greed,  feeding 
on  the  Kusha  Flowers,  does  not  exhaust  their  nectar  neither  do 
the  wicked  savour  friendship  to  the  full. 

"  If  any  other  had  addressed  such  a  speech  to  me,  O  Ranger 
of  the  Night,  he  would  have  ceased  to  breathe  at  that  very 
instant !  As  for  thee,  a  curse  upon  thee,  O  Obloquy  of  thy 
Race!" 

At  this  affront,  Bibishana,  who  ever  spoke  what  was  true, 
rose  up  mace  in  hand  with  four  other  titans  and,  filled  with 
indignation,  that  fortunate  one,  standing  in  space,  said  to  his 
brother,  the  King  of  the  Titans  : — 

*'  Thou  hast  lost  thy  reason,  O  King,  but  say  what  thou  wilt, 

an  elder  brother  is  the  equal  of  a  father  and  must  be  reverenced 

even  if  he  leave  the  path  of  equity ;  nevertheless  I  am  unable  to 

tolerate  these  outrageous  utterances  of  thine  !    Words  of  wisdom 

35 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

that  are  dictated  by  a  desire  for  the  welfare  of  others,  O  Ten- 
necked  One,  are  not  acceptable  to  those  who  are  not  masters  of 
themselves  and  have  fallen  under  the  sway  of  death !  Those 
who  make  flattering  speeches  are  easy  to  find  but  rare  are  they 
who  utter  salutory  though  unpleasmg  words  or  those  who  will 
listen  to  them !  I  could  not  brook  seeing  thee  caught  in  the 
noose  of  death,  who  bears  away  all  beings,  neither  did  I  desire 
to  see  thee  pierced  by  the  sharp  and  golden  arrows  of  Rama 
resembling  naming  torches.  Even  stout-hearted  persons  full  of 
skill  and  courage  fall  in  combat  and  are  carried  away  like  walls 
of  sand  if  death  overcomes  them.  Thou  shouldst  accept  this 
counsel  on  account  of  its  import  for  thine  own  good  !  By  every 
means  defend  thyself  as  well  as  this  city  and  the  titans !  In 
thine  own  interest  I  sought  to  restrain  thee  but  my  words  have 
not  found  favour  with  thee,  O  Ranger  of  the  Night.  Fare-thee- 
well,  I  go ;  thou  wilt  be  happier  without  me  !  At  the  point  of 
death,  those  whose  life  has  run  its  course  do  not  listen  to  the 
advice  of  their  friends  1 " 


Chapter  17 

Words  of  the  leading  Monkeys  regarding  Bibishana 

Having  spoken  thus  severely  to  Ravana,  Bibishana  went  away 
and  almost  immediately  reached  the  place  where  Rama  and 
Lakshmana  were. 

Resembling  the  peak  of  Mount  Meru,  like  a  flash  of  lightning 
in  the  sky,  he  was  seen  by  the  leaders  of  the  monkeys  who  were 
stationed  on  the  ground. 

Accompanied  by  four  titans  of  renowned  courage,  furnished 
with  armour  and  arrows,  adorned  with  marvellous  jewels,  he 
resembled  a  mass  of  cloud,  the  equal  of  the  God  who  wields  the 
Thunderbolt  and  that  hero  was  bearing  excellent  weapons  and 
was  covered  with  celestial  gems. 

Beholding  him  with  his  four  companions,  Sugriva,  the 
sagacious  King  of  the  Monkeys,  who  was  invincible,  standing 
amidst  his  forces  became  thoughtful  and,  after  reflecting  a 

3« 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

moment,  addressed  the  monkeys  with  Hanuman  and  others 
anxiously,  saying : — 

"  Without  doubt,  this  titan,  armed  with  weapons  and 
accompanied  by  four  of  his  kind,  is  coming  to  slay  us  !  " 

Hearing  these  words  of  Sugriva,  all  the  leading  monkeys 
brandishing  great  trees  and  rocks,  said  to  him : — 

"  Do  thou  speedily  order  us  to  slay  these  evil  doers,  O  King  ! 
Let  us  strike  these  weaklings  down  so  that  they  fall  on  the  earth ! " 

As  they  were  speaking  thus,  Bibishana,  who  was  master  of 
himself,  had  reached  the  northern  shore  and  halting  there,  that 
highly  intelligent  and  powerful  titan,  who  was  fully  self- 
subdued,  on  perceiving  Sugriva  and  the  monkeys,  said  aloud 
to  them : — 

"  Ravana  is  the  name  of  a  wicked  titan  and  their  lord,  and  I  am 
his  younger  brother,  my  name  is  Bibishana.  It  is  Ravana  who, 
having  killed  Jatayu,  carried  off  Sita  from  Janasthana.  That 
unfortunate  one  is  held  captive  against  her  will  amidst  the  female 
titans  who  guard  her  jealously.  I  have  tried  to  persuade  them 
by  diverse  arguments,  continually  repeated,  to  return  Sita  to 
Rama  but  Ravana  impelled  by  fate  will  not  listen  to  my  sage 
advice.  Reviled  by  him  and  treated  like  a  slave,  I,  abandoning 
my  consort  and  my  son,  have  come  to  take  refuge  with  Rama. 
Do  thou  inform  the  high-souled  Raghava,  that  magnanimous 
protector  of  the  worlds,  that  I,  Bibishana,  have  come  hither." 

At  these  words,  the  swift-footed  Sugriva,  full  of  indignation, 
ran  to  find  Rama  and,  in  the  presence  of  Lakshmana,  said  to 
him: — 

"  Having  belonged  to  Ravana's  forces,  here  is  an  adversary 
taking  us  unawares,  who  without  warning  has  come  hither  to  slay 
us  at  the  first  opportunity,  like  an  owl  destroying  crows  !  Thou 
knowest  all  concerning  the  plans,  organization,  distribution  of 
troops  and  the  secret  service  of  the  monkeys,  as  also  of  thy  foes, 
O  Thou  who  art  their  scourge !  May  good  betide  Thee ! 
These  titans,  who  are  able  to  change  their  forms  at  will,  conceal 
their  designs ;  they  are  bold  and  inventive  in  strategy,  assuredly 
one  may  not  trust  them ! 

"  This  must  be  an  emissary  of  the  Lord  of  the  Titans  who, 
undoubtedly  has  come  to  sow  dissension  amongst  us  or  to  dis- 
cover our  weak  points  ;  having  first  gained  our  confidence  by 

d  37 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

craft,  he  himself  intends  to  attack  us  one  day.  Assistance  that 
is  provided  by  a  friend  or  an  inhabitant  of  the  woods  like  our- 
selves or  by  a  compatriot  or  a  servant,  may  be  accepted  but  one 
should  eschew  that  offered  by  a  foe,  O  Lord !  This  deserter 
who  has  come  to  us  is  a  titan  by  nature  and  the  brother  of  thine 
adversary,  how  can  we  trust  him  on  first  sight  ?  He  is  Bibishana, 
the  younger  brother  of  Ravana  and  he  has  come  with  four  titans 
to  ask  for  thy  protection.  Nay,  it  is  Ravana  who  has  sent  this 
Bibishana  ;  it  is  essential  that  thou  satisfy  thyself  regarding  him, 
O  Thou,  the  most  circumspect  of  persons !  This  titan  of 
deceitful  soul  has  come  hither  for  the  purpose  of  treacherously 
striking  thee  down  when  thou  dost  least  expect  it,  O  Irreproach- 
able Hero !  Let  him  and  his  confederates  die  in  extreme 
torture,  this  brother  of  the  wicked  Ravana  !  " 

Having  given  vent  to  his  fury  in  the  presence  of  the  eloquent 
Rama,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  a  skilled  orator,  became  silent ! 

Hearing  Sugriva's  words,  the  mighty  Rama  said  to  the 
monkeys  headed  by  Hanuman  who  stood  near : — 

"  You  have  heard  for  yourselves  what  your  Sovereign  has 
expressed  in  judicious  words  of  deep  significance  regarding 
the  younger  brother  of  Ravana  ;  in  times  of  crisis  one  should 
always  receive  the  counsel  of  one  who  desires  the  welfare  of  his 
friends,  and  who  is  intelligent  and  prudent." 

Thus  addressed  by  Rama,  all  those  monkeys,  ardently  desiring 
his  success,  hastened  to  express  their  opinion,  saying : — 

"Nothing  is  unknown  to  thee  in  the  Three  Worlds,  O 
Raghava ;  it  is  in  deference  to  us  that  thou  dost  consult  us  as 
friends !  Thou  art  loyal,  brave,  pious,  established  in  heroism 
and  dost  act  only  after  thou  hast  considered  the  matter  in  accord 
with  tradition  with  full  confidence  in  thy  friends.  Let  all  the 
intelligent  and  experienced  ministers  debate  this  matter 
thoroughly,  each  in  his  turn." 

Thus  spoke  those  monkeys  and  first  the  sagacious  Angada 
suggested  to  Raghava  that  he  should  enquire  into  Bibishana's 
intentions,  saying : — 

"  One  should  sound  a  deserter  who  presents  himself  in  every 

way.    It  would  not  befit  us  to  put  full  trust  in  Bibishana  at  once. 

It  is  in  concealing  their  real  nature  that  these  perfidious  beings 

act,  and  further  they  attack  unexpectedly,  which  would  prove 

3* 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

fatal  to  us.  Examine  him  to  discover  what  is  right  or  wrong 
before  taking  any  decision  and,  if  it  prove  to  our  advantage,  form 
an  alliance  with  him ;  if  to  our  disadvantage,  reject  it.  If  it  be 
fraught  with  danger,  then  renounce  it,  but  if  it  should  bring  us 
real  benefit,  let  us  give  him  a  fitting  welcome  1 " 

Thereafter  Sharabha,  having  reflected  awhile,  gave  his 
opinion,  revealing  his  motives,  saying : — 

"  Without  delay,  O  lion  among  Men,  send  out  a  spy  and, 
having  by  means  of  a  wary  agent,  undertaken  a  thorough 
investigation,  deal  with  him  in  a  suitable  manner." 

Then  Jambavan,  inspired  by  his  knowledge  of  the  scriptures 
and  his  own  experience,  expressed  himself  in  irreproachable 
and  lucid  terms  saying  : — 

"  Bibishana  has  come  to  us  from  a  declared  enemy,  the  wicked 
Lord  of  the  Titans,  and  he  has  arrived  here  without  any  regard 
for  time  and  place ;  let  us  be  on  our  guard  against  him !  " 

In  his  turn,  Mainda,  skilled  in  the  matter  of  truth  and  error, 
a  fluent  speaker,  uttered  these  prudent  words : — 

"  Bibishana  is  the  younger  brother  of  Ravana,  let  us  interro- 
gate him  gently  and  progressively,  O  King  of  Kings  !  When 
thou  hast  informed  thyself  of  his  feelings,  then  act  according  to 
whether  his  intentions  are  honest  or  no,  O  Prince  of  Men  !  " 

Thereafter,  Hanuman,  the  foremost  of  beings  versed  in  the 
scriptures,  spoke  in  sweet  accents  in  words  fraught  with  integrity, 
saying:— 

"  Even  Bibishana  himself  cannot  excel  thee  who  art  of  an 
exalted  intellect  and  the  foremost  of  those  skilled  in  speech.  It 
is  not  from  a  desire  to  speak  nor  out  of  emulation  nor  a  sense  of 
superiority  nor  from  a  love  of  debate  that  I  open  my  mouth,  O 
my  Lord  Rama,  but  on  account  of  the  importance  of  the  matter 
in  hand.  That  which  thy  counsellors  have  said  seems  to  me 
erroneous  and  the  real  question  does  not  lie  there.  If  one  does 
not  interrogate  this  titan,  it  is  impossible  to  discover  why  he 
has  come  hither  but  to  make  use  of  him  has  its  disadvantages 
also.  Concerning  the  sending  out  of  a  spy  to  make  investigations 
as  thy  minister  advises,  I  regard  it  as  unwise  nor  will  it  succeed. 
It  has  been  said  that  Bibishana  had  no  regard  for  time  and  place 
when  he  came  hither,  I  reserve  my  judgment  here ;  it  appears 
to  me  that  the  time  and  place  are  appropriate,  his  fault  or  merit 
39 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

consists  in  leaving  one  for  another.  Knowing  the  wickedness 
of  Ravana  and  thy  true  value,  Bibishana  has,  by  his  arrival, 
shown  his  tact  and  intelligence.  Further  it  was  said,  O  Prince, 
'  Let  emissaries  in  disguise  question  him  *  and  this  speech 
suggested  several  thoughts  to  me.  He  who  is  suddenly  in- 
terrogated, if  he  be  wise,  becomes  cautious  and  refuses  to  speak ; 
the  most  amiable  of  those,  who  come  as  friends,  will  change 
after  such  an  useless  enquiry.  It  is  not  possible,  O  King,  to 
discover  the  character  of  a  stranger  immediately  but  only  after 
frequent  conversations  when  words  may  escape  him  that  will 
betray  any  perfidy.  The  speech  of  this  titan  does  not  indicate 
an  evil  nature  and  further  he  has  an  open  countenance  and  I  have 
no  doubts  concerning  him.  He  is  in  no  way  embarrassed  and  is 
master  of  himself,  he  does  not  appear  to  be  a  knave.  His 
language  is  not  that  of  a  perverse  being  and  I  do  not  fed  any 
suspicion  regarding  him.  Inevitably  people's  real  nature  is 
only  gradually  revealed.  When  an  undertaking  is  suited  to  the 
time  and  place,  O  Most  experienced  of  Men,  and  it  is  a  practical 
proposition,  it  will  meet  with  speedy  success.  Bibishana  is 
aware  of  thy  magnanimity  and  also  of  Ravana's  baseness.  He 
has  heard  of  the  slaying  of  Bali  and  the  crowning  of  Sugriva 
and  what  is  more  he  has  a  desire  to  rule  the  kingdom  !  If  this 
is  what  has  determined  him  to  come  hither  and  these  are 
apparently  his  motives,  then  this  is  what  his  alliance  is  worth  to 
us.  I  have  said  what  I  had  to  say  to  prove  the  upright  character 
of  this  titan ;  thou  hast  listened  to  me  and  the  rest  depends  on 
thee,  O  Prince  of  the  Wise." 


Chapter  18 

Rama  listens  to  the  Advice  of  the  Monkeys  about  receiving  Bibishana 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  Wind-god's  son,  the  invincible  Rama, 
versed  in  the  scriptures,  answered  him  and,  expressing  his  own 
conclusions,  said  : — 

"  I  also  have  reflected  on  Bibishana  and  wish  to  make  the  result 
known  to  thee,  O  Thou  who  art  established  in  virtue  1   I  shall 
40 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

never  refuse  to  receive  one  who  presents  himself  as  a  friend,  even 
were  I  mistaken  no  honest  man  could  reproach  me  for 
it." 

At  these  words,  Sugriva,  that  lion  among  monkeys,  reflecting 
carefully,  replied  in  more  reasonable  words  and  in  eloquent 
terms  addressed  Rama,  saying : — 

"  What  matters  it  if  this  ranger  of  the  night  be  well  or  ill- 
intentioned,  if  in  time  of  peril  he  abandons  his  brother,  whom  will 
he  not  betray  subsequently  ?  " 

At  these  words  of  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  Kakutstha  looked 
round  on  that  company  and,  smiling  gently,  said  to  Lakshmana, 
distinguished  for  his  saintly  characteristics  : — 

"  He  who  has  not  studied  the  scriptures  nor  possessed 
reverence  for  authority  could  not  utter  such  words  as  have  been 
expressed  by  the  Lord  of  Monkeys  !  There  is  however  some- 
thing peculiar  in  these  circumstances,  it  seems  to  me,  which  is 
particularly  to  be  seen  in  monarchs.  Kings  have  two  avowed 
enemies,  their  kinsmen  and  their  neighbours,  who  turn  against 
them  in  times  of  adversity ;  this  is  what  brings  this  titan  here ! 

"  Relatives  who  are  not  of  a  perverse  nature,  honour  those  of 
their  own  family  who  have  treated  them  well  but  in  the  case  of 
kings  even  a  virtuous  relative  is  suspect !  As  to  the  fault  that 
you  point  out  which  consists  in  accepting  the  assistance  of  a  foe, 
I  will  tell  you  what  the  scriptures  say  on  this,  hear  me  ! 

"  We  are  not  related  to  the  titans  and  it  is  not  our  kingdom 
that  he  covets.  It  is  certain  his  compatriots  are  informed  about 
Bibishana's  departure  and  for  this  reason  we  should  receive 
him.  They  will  have  assembled  with  joy  and  without  anxiety  and 
thereafter  the  cry  *  This  one  or  that  is  afraid  *,  will  have  created 
a  division  amongst  them;  this  is  what  has  brought  about 
Bibishana's  arrival  here. 

"  All  brothers,  O  Dear  One,  do  not  resemble  Bharata  nor  all 
sons  what  I  was  to  my  sire  nor  do  all  friends  resemble  each 
other." 

Thus  spoke  Rama,  and  Sugriva  rising,  as  also  Lakshmana, 
bowed  low  and  thereafter  that  exceedingly  sagacious  monkey 
said: — 

"  Know  that  it  is  Ravana  who  has  sent  out  this  ranger  of  the 
night !  I  regard  it  as  imperative  that  we  should  make  an  end 
4i 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  him,  O  Thou,  the  most  circumspect  of  persons !  This  demon 
under  the  order  of  a  perverse  creature  has  come  hither  to  make 
an  assault  on  thee,  myself  and  Lafcshmana,  when  we  are  un- 
prepared for  it,  O  Irreproachable  Warrior.  He  merits  death, 
this  Bibishana,  brother  of  that  inhuman  Ravana,  as  well  as  his 
accomplices." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  the  eloquent  prince  of  the  House  of 
Raghu,  Sugriva,  the  leader  of  the  army,  a  fluent  speaker  became 
silent  and  Rama,  having  listened  to  Sugriva,  that  lion  among 
monkeys,  reflected  awhile  and  then  addressed  that  foremost  of 
monkeys  in  measured  terms,  saying : — 

"  Whether  this  titan  be  ill-intentioned  or  no,  what  does  it 
matter,  he  cannot  do  me  the  least  mischief.  On  earth,  Pisachas, 
Danavas  and  Yakshas,  as  also  the  titans  can  be  slain  by  me  with 
the  tip  of  my  finger,  if  I  so  desire  it,  O  King  of  the  Monkeys. 

"  It  is  related  how  a  pigeon  with  whom  his  adversary  had  taken 
refuge  entertained  him  and  invited  him  to  partake  of  his  own 
flesh,  even  though  he  was  the  ravisher  of  his  mate.  Such  was 
the  hospitality  offered  by  a  pigeon ;  what  should  therefore  a  man 
like  myself  not  do  ?  Hearken  to  these  verses,  pre-eminently 
sacred,  sung  aforetimes  by  the  son  of  Kanva,  that  great  ascetic 
of  truthful  speech,  Kandu : — 

"'A  miscreant  who  approaches  with  joined  palms,  seeking 
refuge,  should  not  in  the  name  of  humanity  be  slain  even  if  he  be 
a  foe,  O  Parantapa  !  The  unfortunate  or  the  fearful  who  plead 
for  shelter  or  throw  themselves  on  the  mercy  of  their  enemy, 
should  be  protected  by  him  who  is  master  of  himself.  If, 
conforming  to  the  tradition,  one  does  not  render  assistance 
according  to  one's  capacity,  either  for  reasons  of  fear,  delusion 
or  anger,  one  is  reproached  by  all  and  the  suppliant,  who  perishes 
before  the  eyes  of  the  one  of  whom  he  has  sought  help  in  vain, 
carries  away  all  his  merit !  * 

"Therefore  it  is  a  heinous  crime  not  to  give  shelter  to  those 
who  petition  it  on  this  earth;  it  is  to  deprive  oneself  of  heaven 
and  glory  and  to  lose  one's  strength  and  prowess !  Consequently 
I  shall  follow  the  excellent  counsel  of  Kandu,  which  is  pious, 
honourable  and  leads  to  heaven  as  the  fruit  of  merit.  Any 
being  who  has  sought  refuge  with  me,  saying — '  I  am  thine  * 
is  assured  of  my  protection,  I  swear  it !    Bring  this  stranger 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

to  me,  0  Monkey,  I  shall  offer  him  security  whether  he  be 
Bibishana  or  Ravana  himself!  " 

Thus  did  Rama  speak  and  Sugriva,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys, 
answered  that  son  of  Kakutstha,  whom  he  held  in  deep  affection, 
thus : — 

"  What  wonder  is  it  that  thou  who  art  loyal,  virtuous  and 
established  in  righteousness,  thou  who  shinest  like  a  jewel  in 
the  head  of  kings,  shouldst  speak  thus  ?  I,  also,  in  my  heart, 
am  convinced  of  Bibishana's  integrity.  Deduction,  feeling, 
everything  has  been  used  to  probe  this  matter  thoroughly; 
let  him  be  admitted  immediately  amongst  us  on  equal  terms,  O 
Raghava !  Let  Bibishana,  who  is  full  of  wisdom,  join  our 
alliance !  " 

At  these  words  of  Sugriva,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  Rama 
immediately  joined  Bibishana  as  Purandara  the  King  of  the 
Birds. 


Chapter  19 

Bibishana  is  brought  before  Rama 

Raghava  having  accorded  him  protection,  the  younger  brother 
of  Ravana,  the  highly  intelligent  Bibishana  bowed  to  him, 
looking  down  on  the  earth. 

Thereafter  he  descended  joyously  from  the  sky  to  the  ground 
with  his  faithful  companions  and  that  virtuous  one  ran  towards 
Rama  and,  falling  at  his  feet  with  the  four  titans,  addressed  him 
in  words  full  of  loyalty  and  discretion,  fitting  the  occasion : — 

"  I  am  Ravana's  younger  brother  and  I  have  been  greatly 
affronted  by  him.  I  have  therefore  come  to  seek  refuge  with 
thee,  the  protector  of  all  beings  !  Abandoning  Lanka,  friends 
and  possessions,  I  place  my  kingdom,  life  and  happiness  at  thy 
disposal ! " 

At  these  words,  Rama,  in  soothing  tones,  while  seeming  to 
consume  him  with  his  gaze,  said : — 

"  O  Bibishana,  tell  me  truly  what  is  the  strength  and  weakness 
of  the  titans?" 

43 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Thus  questioned  by  Rama  of  imperishable  exploits,  that  titan 
described  the  might  and  extent  of  Ravana's  power,  saying : — 
"  By  virtue  of  a  special  boon  conferred  on  him  by  Swyambhu, 
Dashagriva  is  invulnerable  to  all  beings,  Gandharvas,  Serpents 
and  Birds,  O  Prince.  I  have  also  another  brother  older  than 
myself,  the  valiant  Kumbhakarna,  the  illustrious  rival  of  India 
in  war. 

"  0  Rama,  Ravana  has  Prahasta  commanding  his  forces,  who 
is  perhaps  known  to  thee.  It  is  he  who  vanquished  Manibhadra 
in  combat  on  Mount  Kailasha  !  When  clad  in  armour  that  no 
arrow  can  pierce,  furnished  with  his  archer's  gloves,  Indrajita, 
taking  up  his  bow,  makes  himself  invisible,  and  on  the  battle- 
field, having  propitiated  the  God  of  Fire,  that  fortunate  one  sows 
carnage  amongst  the  foe,  O  Raghava.  Mahodara,  Mahaparshwa 
and  the  Titan  Akampana,  who  are  his  lieutenants,  resemble  the 
Lokapalas  on  the  field  of  battle. 

"  Ten  thousand  kotis  of  titans,  able  to  change  their  form  at 
will,  feeding  on  flesh  and  blood,  inhabit  Lanka.  At  their  head, 
their  sovereign  the  wicked  Ravana  made  war  on  the  supporters 
of  the  earth  as  also  the  Gods  who  were  all  overcome  by  him." 

Having  listened  to  Bibishana  and  weighed  his  words  carefully, 
Rama  expressed  himself  thus : — 

"  These  exploits  of  Ravana's  that  thou  hast  faithfully  described 
are  well  known  to  me ;  I  shall  slay  Dashagriva  as  also  Prahasta 
and  his  sons ;  thereafter  I  shall  install  thee  as  king ;  believe  me, 
this  is  the  truth !  Were  he  to  plunge  into  the  region  of  Rasatala 
or  even  Patala  or  take  refuge  with  the  Grandsire  of  the  World, 
he  would  not  escape  alive  !  Before  I  have  annihilated  Ravana 
with  his  sons,  his  kinsfolk  and  his  allies  in  battle,  I  shall  not 
return  to  Ayodhya,  I  swear  it  by  my  three  brothers  !  " 

Thus  did  Rama  of  imperishable  exploits  speak  and  the 
venerable  Bibishana  bowing  unto  him,  said : — 

"  In  the  slaying  of  the  titans  and  the  capture  of  Lanka,  I  will 
assist  thee  with  all  my  strength;  I  will  break  through  the 
enemy's  ranks." 

As  he  spoke  thus,  Rama  embraced  him  and  thereafter  he 
commanded  Lakshmana  saying  : — "  Do  thou  bring  water  from 
the  sea  and  anoint  the  sagacious  Bibishana  as  King  of  the  Titans 
under  my  direction,  O  Noble  Brother  1 " 
44 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Thereupon  Saumitri,  in  accord  with  Rama's  behest,  performed 
the  royal  anointing  in  the  midst  of  the  leading  monkeys  and 
immediately  those  monkeys,  beholding  Bibishana  raised  to  that 
supreme  rank,  acclaimed  that  magnanimous  titan,  crying : 
"  Excellent !  Excellent !  ". 

Meanwhile  Hanuman  and  Sugriva  enquired  of  Bibishana, 
saying : — 

"  How  shall  we,  with  the  mighty  army  of  monkeys  who 
surround  us,  cross  the  ocean,  that  indestructible  empire  of 
Varuna  ?  What  means  should  we  employ  to  traverse  the  refuge 
of  the  Lord  of  Streams  and  Rivers  speedily  with  our  troops  ?  " 

At  this  question,  the  virtuous  Bibishana  answered : — "  That 
Prince,  the  offspring  of  the  Race  of  Raghu,  should  approach  the 
ocean  that  was  excavated  by  Sagara1  and  he  will  assuredly  help 
one  of  his  own  race". 

Thus  spoke  Bibishana,  that  sagacious  titan,  and  Sugriva 
instantly  went  away  with  Laksnmana  to  join  Rama. 

Thereafter  the  thick-necked  Sugriva  conveyed  to  him  this 
salutory  counsel  of  Bibishana's  to  take  refuge  with  Sagara  and 
it  found  favour  with  the  virtuously  minded  Rama.  Then  that 
illustrious  prince  repUed  to  Sugriva,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys, 
who  was  accompanied  by  Laksnmana.  Full  of  respect  for  that 
monkey,  who  sought  to  gratify  him  in  every  way,  he  smiled 
upon  him  as  also  on  his  brother  Laksnmana  and  said : — 

"  This  plan  of  Bibishana's  pleases  me,  O  Sugriva  and 
Laksnmana.  Sugriva  is  sagacious  and  was  ever  a  prudent 
counsellor :  do  ye  both  reflect  on  the  matter  and  say  what  you 
consider  to  be  best.'* 

Having  spoken  thus  to  them,  those  two  warriors  Sugriva  and 
Lakshmana  answered  in  respectful  tones,  saying : — 

"  How  should  the  counsel  of  Bibishana  not  find  favour  with 
us  in  these  circumstances  ?  He  brings  us  the  means  to  success. 
Without  throwing  a  bridge  over  the  sea,  that  redoubtable 
dominion  of  Lanka  will  remain  inaccessible  even  to  the  Gods 
and  titans  with  their  leaders.  Let  us  carry  out  the  suggestion 
of  the  virtuous  Bibishana  scrupulously ;  enough  time  has  been 
lost.  Let  us  approach  Sagara,  so  that  with  our  army  we  may 
reach  Lanka  of  which  Ravana  is  the  support." 

1  Sagara  being  one  of  Rama's  ancestors.     His  story  is  told  in  Balakanda.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

At  these  words,  Rama  proceeded  to  the  shore  that  was  covered 
with  Kusha  Grass  belonging  to  the  Lord  of  Streams  and  Rivers 
as  the  God  of  Fire  ascends  the  altar. 


Chapter  20 

Havana  sends  Shuka  to  Sugriva 

Now  the  titan,  Shardula  by  name,  who  had  gone  out  to  recon- 
noitre, beheld  the  army  encamped  under  Sugriva's  command, 
and  that  spy  belonging  to  the  wicked  Ravana,  King  of  the  Titans, 
having  inspected  those  troops,  returned  and,  regaining  Lanka 
with  all  speed,  said  to  his  sovereign  : — 

"  Behold  a  multitude  of  monkeys  and  bears,  immeasurable 
and  boundless  as  the  sea,  approaching  Lanka.  The  sons  of 
Dasaratha,  the  brothers  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  who  are  illus- 
trious and  endowed  with  beauty,  have  come  to  search  for  Sita. 
Having  reached  the  shores  of  the  sea,  they  have  encamped  there, 
O  Illustrious  Prince.  These  forces  cover  ten  leagues  in  extent 
in  every  direction  !  O  Great  King,  it  behoves  thee  to  inform 
thyself  of  the  true  state  of  affairs  immediately !  Let  thine 
emissaries  enquire  into  the  matter  speedily ;  restitution, 
conciliation  or  sowing  dissension  are  involved  here."  * 

Hearing  Shardula's  words,  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans 
became  perturbed  and,  reflecting  on  the  matter,  instantly  gave 
orders  to  Shuka,  the  most  skilled  of  negotiators,  saying  : — 

"  Go  and  seek  out  Sugriva  on  my  behalf  and  say  to  that 
prince  in  persuasive  and  ingratiating  tones  : — 

"  Assuredly  thou,  the  offspring  of  a  race  of  great  monarchs, 
the  mighty  son  of  the  King  of  the  Bears,  art  exceedingly 
powerful !  Thou  hast  nothing  to  fear ;  thou  art  to  me  as  a 
brother,  O  Lord  of  the  Monkeys.  If  I  bore  away  the  consort 
of  that  crafty  prince,  what  is  it  to  thee  ?  Do  thou  return  to 
Kishkindha;  Lanka  cannot  be  conquered  by  these  monkeys 
by  any  means  nor  by  the  united  efforts  of  the  Gods  with  the 
Gandharvas,  how  much  less  by  men  or  apes  ? * " 

1  Tlie  Three  means  of  dealing  with  an  enemy. 

46 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

At  this  command  of  the  King  of  the  Titans,  that  Night- 
ranger  Shuka,  rising  into  the  air,  rapidly  passed  through  space 
and,  having  journeyed  for  some  time  high  over  the  waters, 
halted  and,  standing  in  the  sky,  repeated  all  he  had  been  told 
by  the  wicked  Ravana  to  say  to  Sugriva.  As  he  was  still  speak- 
ing, the  monkeys  bounded  into  the  air  and,  smiting  him  with 
their  fists,  prepared  to  tear  him  to  pieces  and  fling  him  to  the 
ground. 

Thus  maltreated  by  the  monkeys,  Shuka  spoke  in  this  wise  : — 

"  One  does  not  assault  an  ambassador,  O  Kakutstha,  therefore 
send  away  these  monkeys.  He  who  withholds  the  message  of 
his  master  and  gives  voice  to  that  which  he  has  not  been  author- 
ized to  utter,  merits  death." 

Hearing  Shuka's  complaints,  Rama  issued  a  command  to 
those  monkeys,  who  were  assaulting  that  titan,  saying : — "  Do 
not  slay  him ! "  and  Shuka  having  received  immunity  from  the 
attacks  of  the  monkeys,  steadying  himself  in  the  air  with  his 
wings,  spoke  again,  saying  : — 

"  O  Sugriva,  Thou  who  an  endowed  with  magnanimity,  O 
Hero,  who  art  full  of  energy  and  valour,  what  shall  I  say  to  thee 
on  the  part  of  Ravana,  the  Scourge  of  the  World  ?  " 

Being  thus  addressed,  that  mighty  King  of  the  Monkeys,  the 
foremost  of  all  the  apes,  interrupted  that  Ranger  of  the  Night, 
Shuka,  and  made  the  following  proud  reply,  characteristic  of 
his  nature : — 

"  Thou  art  not  my  friend  nor  art  thou  worthy  of  my  pity, 
thou  art  neither  my  benefactor  nor  dost  thou  find  favour  with 
me !  Thou  and  thy  kinsfolk  are  the  enemies  of  Rama,  thou 
shalt  perish  like  Bali  and  thou  meritest  death !  I  shall  annihilate 
thee,  thy  sons,  thy  relatives  as  also  Lanka  to  which  I  shall  lay 
siege  at  the  head  of  my  great  army  and  reduce  it  to  ashes ! 

**  Nay,  thou  insensate  Ravana,  thou  shalt  never  esca  pe  Raghava 
even  if  thou  wert  protected  by  the  Gods  themselves  with  their 
leaders.  Wert  thou  to  make  thyself  invisible  in  the  sun's  path 
or  enter  into  hell  or  take  refuge  at  the  lotus  feet  of  the  King  of 
the  Mountains,1  thou  with  thy  followers  wilt  succumb  to 
Rama's  blows.  In  the  Three  Worlds,  I  see  none  whether  be  it 
Pisacha,   Rakshasa,   Gandharva,   or   Asura,   who  is  able  to 

1  Mt.  Kailneha.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

protea  thee  !  Thou  hast  slain  the  aged  King  of  the  Vultures 
and  carried  off  the  large-eyed  Sita  in  the  presence  of  Rama  and 
Lakshmana  and,  having  made  her  captive,  dost  not  recognize 
her  for  what  she  is  !  Thou  art  unaware  how  strong,  powerful 
and  irresistible  to  the  Gods  themselves  is  this  Prince  of  the  Race 
of  Raghu,  who  shall  deprive  thee  of  thy  life." 

Thereafter  the  foremost  of  monkeys,  the  son  of  Bali,  Angada, 
took  up  the  discourse  and  said : — 

"  O  Virtuous  King,  this  is  no  ambassador,  he  has  the  appear- 
ance of  a  spy  ;  he  is  only  here  to  count  our  forces,  let  him  be 
arrested,  do  not  allow  him  to  return  to  Lanka.  Such  is  my 
opinion." 

Thereupon  at  a  sign  from  the  king,  the  monkeys  flung  them- 
selves on  that  titan,  whom  they  seized  and  bound,  whilst  he, 
without  defence,  wailed  loudly. 

Ill-treated  by  those  furious  monkeys,  Shuka  began  to  cry 
upon  the  magnanimous  Rama,  born  of  Dasaratha,  saying : — 

"  They  are  tearing  out  my  wings  ruthlessly  and  putting  out 
my  eyes,  may  the  consequences  of  all  the  evil  deeds  that  I  have 
done  since  the  day  I  was  born  till  the  night  I  die,  fall  on  thee  if 
I  lose  my  life !  " 

Hearing  his  cries,  Rama  would  not  sanction  his  death  and 
ordered  the  monkeys  to  release  him. 


CHAPTER   2  I 

Rama   looses   his   Arrows   on    Sagara 

Thereafter,  spreading  the  Darbha  Grass  on  the  shore  of  the  sea, 
Rama  with  joined  palms,  his  face  turned  towards  the  east,  made 
obeisance  in  honour  of  the  ocean  and  laid  himself  down. 

That  Scourge  of  bis  Foes  pillowed  his  head  on  his  arms  that 
resembled  the  coils  of  a  serpent  and  were  adorned  with  ornaments 
of  gold,  their  habitual  decoration ;  those  arms  that  formerly  were 
perfumed  with  sandal  and  aloes,  saffron  of  the  hue  of  the  dawn 
lending  them  lustre ;  those  arms  on  which  Sita  leant  on  the 
nuptual  couch  causing  them  to  shine  as  do  the  waters  of  the 
48 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Ganges  the  body  of  Takshaka ;  those  arms,  resembling  the  shafts 
of  a  chariot,  that  increased  the  distress  of  his  foes  and  the  delight 
of  his  friends,  were  stretched  out  on  the  shore  of  the  sea. 

The  tightening  of  the  bow-string  had  rubbed  the  skin  off  the 
left  arm  of  that  skilful  archer  and  the  right,  that  bestower  of 
thousands  of  kine  in  charity,  resembled  a  great  mace.  Leaning 
on  his  powerful  elbow,  the  mighty-armed  Rama  said  : — 

"  Sagara  will  grant  me  a  passage  or  he  shall  be  slain  by  me  !  " 

Having  thus  resolved,  he  lay  down  by  the  ocean,  restraining 
his  speech  and  with  a  concentrated  mind  in  accord  with 
tradition.  There,  following  the  scriptural  injunction,  Rama 
lay  on  the  ground  spread  with  Kusha  Grass  and  slept  peacefully 
for  three  nights.  For  three  nights  Rama,  endowed  with  learning 
and  piety,  remained  beside  Sagara,  the  Lord  of  the  Waters. 
Nevertheless  that  indolent  one  did  not  appear  to  that  hero,  who 
had  yet  paid  him  honour  as  was  his  due.  Thereupon,  his  eyes 
suffused  with  wrath,  Raghava,  enraged  against  him,  said  to 
Lakshmana,  the  bearer  of  auspicious  marks,  who  stood  near : — 

"  It  is  from  contempt  that  the  Ocean  does  not  appear  to  me 
in  person !  Deference  and  forbearance,  integrity  and  friendly 
speech,  these  qualities  belonging  to  virtuous  men  are  not  valued 
by  those  who  are  deprived  of  them,  who  regard  them  as  weakness, 
whereas  the  braggart,  the  dissolute  and  the  arrogant  who  boast 
openly  and  commit  every  kind  of  excess,  are  overwhelmed  with 
regard !  Meekness  will  never  bring  victory  on  this  earth,  O 
Lakshmana,  any  more  than  in  the  forefront  of  battle !  To-day, 
pierced  by  my  shafts,  thou  shall  behold  aquatic  monsters  by 
their  leaping  churn  up  the  waters  where  they  dwell  on  every 
side !  See,  O  Lakshmana,  how  I  shall  sever  the  serpents*  coils 
and  the  limbs  of  the  great  fish  like  unto  the  trunks  of  elephants. 
To-day  I  shall  dry  up  the  ocean  with  its  multitudinous  waves, 
shells,  pearls,  fish  and  monsters.  Because  I  have  manifested 
patience,  the  Ocean,  the  abode  of  whales,  regards  me  as  power- 
less !  Away  with  forbearance  to  such  persons  !  It  is  on 
account  of  my  mildness  that  he  manifests  his  true  nature ! 
Bring  me  my  bow,  O  Saumitri  and  mine  arrows  resembling 
venomous  snakes,  I  shall  dry  up  the  sea  and  the  monkeys  may 
then  cross  it  on  foot !  To-day,  indomitable  though  he  be, 
I  shall  yet  overthrow  Sagara  with  my  shafts ;  he  who  is  bounded 
49 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

by  the  shore  and  who  is  filled  with  a  myriad  waves !  I  shall 
wipe  out  that  Ocean,  the  Abode  of  Varuna,  that  is  inhabited  by 
great  giants." 

Speaking  thus,  bow  in  hand,  his  eyes  dilated  with  anger, 
Rama  appeared  exceedingly  terrible,  like  unto  the  Fire  at  the 
end  of  the  world  cycle.  Grasping  his  formidable  bow  with  its 
barbed  and  fearful  shafts  more  firmly,  he  caused  the  earth 
to  tremble  as  does  Shatakraru  with  his  thunderbolts.  His 
flaming  and  impetuous  arrows,  unrivalled  in  power,  penetrated 
the  waters  of  the  sea  and  struck  terror  in  the  serpents.  And 
those  waves  of  the  sea  with  their  sharks  and  monsters,  were 
extremely  agitated,  so  that  with  the  roaring  of  the  wind,  a 
formidable  clamour  arose.  In  a  trice,  the  ocean  became  a  mass 
of  clashing  waves,  throwing  up  spray,  shells  and  fragments  of 
mother  of  pearl,  and  panic  spread  among  the  Pannagas  of 
flaming  jaws  and  brassy  eyes  and  amidst  the  mighty  Danavas 
in  their  abode,  the  depths  of  hell.  Waves  in  their  millions  as 
high  as  the  Vindhya  and  Mandara  Mountains  rose  from  that 
Lord  of  Waters  with  his  crocodiles  and  great  fish  and  the  Ocean 
emitted  a  loud  roaring,  amidst  the  breaking  billows,  with  the 
terrified  serpents,  demons  and  great  crocodiles  in  flight. 

Then  Saumitri  rushed  towards  Rama,  who,  in  his  burning 
ardour,  was  stretching  bis  incomparable  bow  with  loud 
mutterings,  crying: — "Stay!  Stay!"  and  thus  speaking,  he 
took  hold  of  that  weapon,  saying : — 

"  Thou  hast  no  need  to  act  in  this  wise  to  accomplish  thine 
end  and  bring  Sagara  to  subjection,  O  Foremost  of  Heroes  ! 
Thy  peers  do  not  permit  themselves  to  be  overcome  by  anger  ! 
Call  to  mind  the  forbearance  of  virtuous  men !  " 

At  that  instant,  the  Brahmarishis  and  celestial  Rishis,  who, 
invisible,  were  stationed  in  the  sky,  cried  out : — "  Hold ! 
Hold !  do  not  act  thus !  " 


YUjDDHA     KANDA 

CHAPTER    22 

The    Army    crosses    the    Sea 

Thereafter  the  Prince  of  the  Raghus  addressed  the  Ocean  in 
menacing  tones,  saying  : — 

"  To-day  I  shall  dry  up  the  sea  with  the  nether  regions  !  O 
Sagara,  with  thy  waters  consumed  by  my  shafts,  thy  denizens 
slain  by  my  blows,  a  great  cloud  of  dust  will  arise  from  thy 
drained  bed  and  the  monkeys  will  cross  to  the  other  shore  on 
foot! 

"Thou  hast  sought  to  oppose  me  but  art  unaware  of  my 
valour  or  my  strength !  O  Abode  of  the  Danavas,  being  full  of 
pride,  thou  canst  not  foresee  thy  fate !  " 

Thereafter,  fixing  an  arrow  resembling  the  Rod  of  Brahma 
and  placing  it  on  his  excellent  bow,  Raghava  stretched  that 
weapon,  and  heaven  and  earth  seemed  to  be  riven,  as  it  were, 
and  the  mountains  trembled,  darkness  covered  the  earth  and 
all  the  regions  were  obscured.  Tremors  ran  through  the  lakes 
and  rivers ;  the  sun,  moon  and  stars  swerved  in  their  course  and 
though  the  sky  was  lit  by  the  sun's  rays,  it  was  enveloped  in 
darkness  and  blazed  with  a  hundred  meteors,  whilst  thunder 
reverberated  with  an  unparalleled  sound  in  the  firmament.  The 
five  celestial  Maruts  blew  and  like  massed  legions  tore  up  the 
trees,  dispersing  the  clouds  in  the  twinkling  of  an  eye,  breaking 
off  the  points  of  the  rocks  and  shattering  the  mountain  peaks. 
In  the  sky,  loud  thunder  claps  resounded  with  immense  power 
and  tumult.  The  invisible  beings  emitted  cries  of  fear  and, 
lying  prostrate  on  the  earth  in  their  agony,  shook  with  terror, 
convulsed  and  unable  to  move.  Thereafter  the  Ocean  with  its 
mass  of  water,  serpents  and  demons  surged  beyond  its  confines 
to  the  extent  of  a  league,  though  the  time  of  the  final  deluge  was 
not  yet  at  hand ;  nevertheless  Rama,  the  descendant  of  Raghu, 
scourge  of  his  foes,  did  not  retreat  before  the  disordered  heavings 
of  that  Lord  of  Rivers  and  Streams  ! 

Sagara  himself  rose  out  of  the  waves,  like  the  day's  orb  rising 
5* 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

over  the  eastern  mountain,  Meru,  and  that  Ocean  appeared  with 
the  Pannagas  of  naming  jaws  and  he  was  of  the  hue  of  emerald, 
adorned  with  gold ;  wreaths  of  pearls  festooned  his  attire  and  on 
his  head  he  bore  a  diadem  of  every  kind  of  flower ;  ornaments  of 
refined  gold  and  pearls  from  his  domain  were  his  decoration. 
Covered  with  gems  and  metals  of  every  kind,  resembling  the 
Himavat  Mountain,  the  waters  surging  round  him,  he  was 
encircled  by  the  clouds  and  winds,  while  the  rivers  Gunga  and 
Sindhu  were  his  escorts. 

Rising,  the  noble  Sagara,  escorted  by  the  rivers  with  the  Gunga 
and  Indus  at  their  head,  approached  Rama  with  joined  palms, 
who  stood  arrows  in  hand,  and,  reflecting  awhile  the  Ocean  said: — 

"  Earth,  wind,  air,  water  and  light,  O  Beloved  Raghava, 
remain  fixed  in  their  own  nature.  Neither  from  desire  nor 
ambition  nor  fear,  O  Prince,  nor  from  affection  am  I  able  to 
solidify  my  waters  inhabited  by  sharks  ;  nevertheless  I  will  make 
it  possible  for  thee  to  cross  over  them !  This  is  my  resolve — 
the  sharks  will  remain  inactive  while  the  army  makes  its  way 
across  and,  for  the  monkeys,  I  shall  become  like  the  earth  ! " 

On  this,  Rama  said  to  him : — "Hear  me,  O  Thou  who  art  the 
refuge  of  Varuna  !  This  arrow  of  mine  must  accomplish  its 
intended  end  !  Where  shall  I  let  this  mighty  shaft  fall  ?  " 

Hearing  Rama's  words  and  seeing  that  formidable  missile,  the 
exceedingly  powerful  Ocean  replied  : — 

"  To  the  north  of  this  place  is  a  sacred  region,  Drumakulya, 
a  name  as  renowned  in  the  world  as  thine  own !  There 
innumerable  robbers  of  fearful  aspect  and  deeds,  having  Abhiras 
as  their  chief,  drink  my  waters.  The  vicinity  of  those  perverse 
beings  is  intolerable  to  me ;  it  is  there,  O  Rama,  that  thou 
shouldst  loose  thy  shaft  that  never  misses  its  target." 

Thus  spoke  the  magnanimous  Sagara  and  Rama,  in  accord 
with  his  wish,  let  fly  that  marvellous  dart  in  his  presence.  And 
the  place,  where  that  arrow  resembling  a  flash  of  lightning  fell,  is 
known  in  the  world  as  the  desert  of  Maru1.  The  earth  pierced 
by  that  dart  emitted  a  loud  cry  and  from  its  gaping  wound  the 
waters  of  hell  gushed  forth.  As  the  arrow  fell,  it  created  a 
thunderous  sound  and  the  deep  crater  which  is  known  as  Vrana" 


1  Mam — Malwar  in  Ragasthan. 
1  Vrana— The  Wound. 


52 


YUDJDHA    KA*NDA 

was  filled  with  the  water  of  the  deeper  springs ;  it  seemed  as  if 
the  earth  was  riven  and  wells  and  ponds  appeared  there.  This 
place  became  known  as  Marukantara  and  is  famous  in  the  Three 
Worlds.  Thereafter  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  having  dried 
up  the  waters  of  the  ocean,  conferred  a  boon,  saying : — 

"  This  place  shall  be  rich  in  pasturage  and  free  from  disease ; 
it  will  abound  in  fruit,  roots,  honey,  ghee  and  milk  and  be 
fragrant  with  aromatic  herbs ;  thus  it  will  remain  retaining  those 
excellent  qualities  E " 

In  this  way  the  Desert  of  Mara  came  to  possess  these  manifold 
features  and  by  the  grace  of  Rama's  liberality,  assumed  a 
pleasant  aspect.  When  the  waters  had  been  dried  up,  Samudra, 
the  Lord  of  Streams  and  Rivers,  said  to  Raghava,  who  was 
skilled  in  the  use  of  weapons  : — 

"  My  Friend,  there  stands  Nala,  the  son  of  Vishvakarma, 
whose  father  has  overwhelmed  him  with  gifts ;  he  is  generous 
and  devoted ;  great  are  the  powers  of  that  monkey ;  let  him 
construct  a  bridge  over  my  waters,  I  will  uphold  it ;  Nala  is  as 
skilled  as  his  sire  !  " 

At  these  words  the  Ocean  disappeared  and  Nala,  that  prince 
of  monkeys  spoke  to  the  valiant  Rama  thus  : — 

"  Resorting  to  the  skill  I  have  inherited  from  my  sire,  I  shall 
build  a  bridge  over  the  spacious  and  vast  domain  of  aquatic 
monsters ;  what  the  Ocean  has  said  is  true ! 

"  When  one  has  to  do  with  the  ungrateful,  in  my  opinion  the 
rod  is  the  most  salutory  method  for  men !  A  plague  on  forbear- 
ance as  also  on  generosity  and  kindness !  Assuredly  Sagara,  that 
formidable  mass  of  water,  in  fear  of  punishment,  wished  to  see 
a  bridge  constructed  and  out  of  fear  was  willing  to  suffer 
Raghava  to  pass  over  it. 

"My  mother  received  a  boon  on  the  Mandara  Mountain 
from  Vishvakarma,  who  said  to  her  : — '  A  son  will  be  born  to 
thee  who  will  resemble  me,  O  Goddess  ! ' 

"No  one  having  questioned  me,  I  have  not  spoken  of  my 
powers  but  I  can  assuredly  construct  a  causeway  over  Varuna's 
domain ;  from  to-day  let  all  the  leading  monkeys  set  to  work  1 " 

At  Rama's  command,  those  lions  among  the  monkeys  entered 
the  mighty  forest  with  alacrity  in  hundreds  and  thousands  on 
every  side  and  those  leaders  of  the  simian  tribes,  tearing  up  the 

E  53 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

rocks,  which  in  size  they  resembled,  and  the  trees  also  dragged 
them  to  the  sea  and  they  covered  the  ocean  with  Sala,  Ashvakarna, 
Dhava,  Vamsha,  Kutaja,  Arjuna,  Tala,  Tilaka,  Tinisha, 
Balalaka,  Saptaparna  and  Karnikarna  Trees  in  full  flower,  as 
also  Cutas  and  Ashokas.  Those  foremost  of  monkeys  trans- 
ported those  trees,  with  or  without  roots,  bearing  them  like  so 
many  standards  of  Indra  and  they  heaped  Talas  and  piles  of 
Dadina,  Narikela,  Bibhitaka,  Kanya,  Bakula  and  Nimba  Trees 
here  and  there.  With  the  aid  of  mechanical  devices,  those 
powerful  colossi  dug  up  stones  as  big  as  elephants  and  rocks,  and 
the  water  suddenly  spouted  into  the  air  only  to  fell  instandy. 
Thereafter  those  monkeys  churned  up  the  sea  by  rushing  into 
it  on  all  sides  or  pulling  on  the  chains. 

That  immense  causeway  constructed  by  Nala  in  the  bosom 
of  the  sea  was  built  by  the  arms  of  those  monkeys  of  formidable 
exploits  and  it  extended  over  a  hundred  leagues. 

Some  brought  trunks  of  trees  and  others  set  them  up ;  it  was 
by  hundreds  and  thousands  that  those  monkeys,  like  unto  giants, 
made  use  of  reeds,  logs  and  blossoming  trees  to  construct  that 
bridge,  rushing  hither  and  thither  with  blocks  of  stone  resembling 
mountains  or  the  peaks  of  crags,  which,  flung  into  the  sea,  fell 
with  a  resounding  crash. 

The  first  day  those  monkeys  resembling  elephants,  of  immense 
energy,  full  of  high  spirits  and  exceedingly  merry,  erected 
fourteen  leagues  of  masonry.  The  second  day,  those  highly 
active  monkeys  of  formidable  stature  set  up  twenty  leagues. 
Bestirring  themselves,  those  giants  threw  twenty-one  leagues  of 
structure  over  the  ocean  on  the  third  day  and  on  the  fourth, 
working  feverishly,  they  built  up  twenty-two  leagues  in  extent. 
The  fifth  day,  those  monkeys,  industrious  workers,  reached  to 
twenty-three  leagues  distance  from  the  further  shore. 

That  fortunate  and  valiant  son  of  Vishvakarma,  leader  of 
monkeys,  constructed  a  causeway  worthy  of  his  sire  over  the 
ocean  and  that  bridge  erected  by  Nala  over  the  sea,  the  haunt 
of  whales,  dazzling  in  its  perfection  and  splendour,  was  like  the 
constellation  of  Svati  in  space. 

Then  the  Gods,  Gandharvas,  Siddhas  and  supreme  Rishis 

assembling,  stood  in  the  sky,  eager  to  see  that  masterpiece  and 

the  Gods  and  Gandharvas  gazed  on  that  causeway,  so  difficult 

54 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

of  construction  that  was  ten  leagues  in  width  and  a  hundred  in 
length  built  by  Nala. 

Those  monkeys  thereafter  dived,  swam  and  shouted  at  the 
sight  of  that  unimaginable  marvel  that  was  almost  inconceivable 
and  caused  one  to  tremble  !  And  all  beings  beheld  that  causeway 
thrown  over  the  ocean  and  by  hundreds  and  thousands  of  kotis, 
those  monkeys,  full  of  valour,  having  built  that  bridge  over  the 
immense  repository  of  waters,  reached  the  opposite  shore. 

Vast,  well-constructed,  magnificent  with  its  wonderful  paved 
floor,  solidly  cemented,  that  great  causeway  like  unto  a  line 
traced  on  the  waves,  resembled  the  parting  of  a  woman's  hair. 

Meanwhile  Bibishana,  mace  in  hand,  held  himself  ready  at 
his  post  with  his  companions  in  case  of  an  enemy  attack. 
Thereafter  Sugriva  addressed  Rama,  who  was  valiant  by 
nature,  saying: — 

"  Mount  on  the  shoulders  of  Hanuman  and  Lakshmana  on 
those  of  Angada.  O  Hero,  vast  is  this  ocean,  the  abode  of 
whales ;  those  two  monkeys  who  freely  range  the  sky  will 
transport  you  both !  " 

Then  the  fortunate  Rama  and  Lakshmana  advanced  thus  and 
that  magnanimous  archer  was  accompanied  by  Sugriva.  Some 
monkeys  strode  forward  in  the  centre,  some  threw  themselves 
into  the  waves,  some  sprang  into  the  sky,  others  marched  on  the 
bridge,  some  ranged  through  space  like  birds,  and  the  terrific 
tumult  of  the  tramping  of  that  formidable  army  of  monkeys, 
drowned  the  roar  of  the  ocean. 

When  those  simian  troops  had  passed  over  the  sea  by  the  grace 
of  Nala's  causeway,  the  king  ordered  them  to  camp  on  the  shore 
which  abounded  in  roots,  fruits  and  water. 

At  the  sight  of  that  masterpiece  that  had  materialized  under  the 
command  of  Raghava,  despite  the  difficulties,  the  Gods,  who  had 
drawn  near  with  the  Siddhas  and  Charanas  as  also  the  great 
Rishis,  anointed  Rama  in  secret  there,  with  water  from  the  sea 
and  said: — 

"  Mayest  thou  be  victorious  over  thy  foes,  O  Thou,  who  art  a 
God  amongst  men  !  Do  thou  rule  over  the  earth  and  the  sea 
eternally  I " 

Thus  in  various  auspicious  words  did  they  acclaim  Rama  in 
the  midst  of  the  homage  offered  to  him  by  the  brahmins. 

55 


THE    RAMAYANA     OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER    23 

Rama  sees  diverse  Portents 

The  elder  brother  of  Lakshmana  beheld  certain  portents  and 
as  their  significance  was  known  to  him,  he  embraced  Saumitri 
and  said : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  occupying  this  region  provided  with  fresh 
water,  and  woods  abounding  in  fruit,  let  us  speedily  divide  these 
innumerable  forces  and  form  ourselves  into  battalions  !  Great 
is  the  danger  I  foresee,  boding  destruction  to  the  world  and  the 
slaughter  of  the  valiant  bears,  monkeys  and  titans. 

"A  dust  storm  is  blowing  up,  die  earth  trembles  and  the 
peaks  of  the  mountains  shake ;  trees  fall,  clouds  resembling  wild 
beasts  emit  a  terrible  roaring  and  let  loose  dreadful  showers 
mingled  with  blood ;  there  is  an  awe-inspiring  twilight,  lurid 
like  unto  red  sandalwood ;  from  the  blazing  sun,  a  circle  of  fire 
falls ;  filled  with  terror,  wild  beasts  and  birds  with  harsh  voices 
are  raising  mournful  cries  to  the  sun  on  every  side.  In  the 
night,  the  moon,  bereft  of  brilliance,  burning  with  a  black  and 
red  halo  as  it  rises,  resembles  the  destruction  threatening  the 
world.  A  dark  stain  appears  on  the  solar  disc  which  is 
diminished,  sombre,  without  radiance  and  coppery.  Behold,  O 
Lakshmana,  a  thick  dust  blots  out  the  stars  and  seems  to 
foreshadow  the  end  of  the  world  !  Crows,  eagles  and  vultures 
fall  wheeling,  whilst  jackals  inspiring  the  greatest  terror  emit 
sinister  howls.  Rocks,  maces  and  spears,  hurled  by  the  monkeys 
and  demons,  cover  the  earth  which  has  become  a  morass  of 
flesh  and  blood. 

"Without  delay,  attended  by  all  the  monkeys,  let  us,  this  very 
day,  attack  this  city  difficult  of  access  of  which  Ravana  is  the 
support ! " 

Thus  spoke  the  Archer  Rama,  the  subduer  of  the  foe  in  conflict, 
and,  bearing  his  bow  and  arrows,  he  set  forth  in  the  direction  of

YUDDHA    KANDA 

Thereupon  all  the  valiant  monkeys  with  Bibishana  and  Sugriva 
at  their  head  rose  up  crying  destruction  on  their  powerful  foe 
and  the  boisterous  demonstration  of  those  heroic  monkeys, 
made  with  the  object  of  pleasing  Rama,  filled  that  son  of  the 
House  of  Raghu  with  delight. 


chapter    24 

Shuka  describes  his  Reception  by  tne  Monkeys  to  Ravana 

That  army  of  warriors  in  well-ordered,  formations  looked 
splendid  with  the  radiance  Rama  conferred  on  it  which  resembled 
the  full  moon  on  a  starry  night,  and  the  earth,  pressed  under  foot 
by  the  energetic  tread  of  that  multitude  like  unto  the  sea,  trembled 
with  fear. 

Meanwhile  those  inhabitants  of  the  woods  heard  a  great 
tumult  arising  in  Lanka  and  the  formidable  rolling  of  drums  and 
clashing  of  gongs  caused  their  hair  to  stand  on  end.  This 
clamour  filled  the  leaders  of  the  monkeys  with  joy  and,  in  their 
ardour,  they  emitted  shouts  that  surpassed  that  uproar,  and  the 
cheering  of  the  Plavamgamas,  resembling  the  rumble  of  thunder 
in  the  skies,  reached  the  ears  of  the  titans. 

Seeing  Lanka  dressed  with  many  coloured  banners,  the  son  of 
Dasaratha  bethought  himself  of  Sita  and  his  heart  was  filled 
with  grief.  He  reflected — '  It  is  there  that  that  youthful  woman, 
whose  eyes  resemble  a  gazelle's,  is  held  captive  by  Ravana,  like 
Rohini  when  she  is  overpowered  by  the  red-bodied  planet  '*. 

Heaving  long  and  burning  sighs,  that  hero  looked  at 
Lakshmana  and  spoke  words  fitting  to  the  occasion  to  him  : — 

"  See,  O  Lakshmana,  this  marvellous  city,  built  by 
Vishvakarma  on  the  summit  of  the  mountain,  set  aloft  so  that  it 
appears  to  lick  the  skies,  where  innumerable  palaces  cluster 
like  unto  the  aerial  abode  of  Vishnu  covered  with  white  clouds ; 
Lanka  with  its  blossoming  groves  looks  magnificent  like 
Chaitaratha  which  is  filled  with  the  song  of  birds  of  every  kind 
and  glowing  with  fruit  and  flowers  !  See  how  a  gentle  breeze

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

sways  the  branches  from  which  the  birds  dart,  where  bees  swarm 
and  where  cuckoos  abound." 

Thus  did  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha  address  Lakshmana  and 
thereafter  ranging  his  forces  according  to  the  traditional  methods, 
he  issued  the  following  commands  to  that  army  of  monkeys. 

"  Let  the  valiant  and  invincible  Angada  place  his  troops  in  the 
centre  with  the  General  Nila.  Surrounded  by  the  simian 
battalions,  Rishabha  should  establish  himself  on  the  right  wing 
of  the  army,  and  he  who  resembles  an  elephant  in  mustha,  the 
indomitable  and  courageous  Gandhamadana,  should  place 
himself  at  the  head  of  the  left  flank.  I  shall  go  to  the  forefront 
of  the  army  with  Lakshmana  as  mine  aide-de-camp  and 
Jambavan,  Sushena  and  Vegadarshin  to  spy  out  the 
land. 

"  Those  three  high-souled  ones,  the  leaders  of  the  bears,  should 
protect  the  centre  of  the  forces  and  the  rearguard  be  under  the 
command  of  the  Lord  of  Monkeys,  as  the  western  region  is 
dominated  by  the  sun  of  brilliant  rays." 

The  innumerable  divisions  being  thus  skilfully  distributed, 
that  army,  led  by  the  foremost  of  monkeys  armed  with  boulders 
and  huge  trees,  resembled  the  heavens  with  its  mass  of  clouds ; 
and  those  monkeys  advanced  on  Lanka  that  they  were  eager  to 
destroy. 

"  It  is  with  the  peaks  of  mountains  that  we  shall  demolish 
Lanka  or  if  need  be  with  our  bare  fists !  "  such  was  the  resolve 
of  those  powerful  monkeys. 

At  that  instant  the  exceedingly  valiant  Rama  said  to  Sugriva  : — 

"  Our  forces  are  properly  marshalled,  now  let  Shuka  be 
released !  ** 

Under  the  order  of  that  Indra  of  Monkeys,  who  was  full  of 
energy,  Havana's  agent  was  set  at  liberty.  Released  on  Rama's 
command  and  harassed  by  the  monkeys,  Shuka,  in  a  frenzy  of 
terror  went  to  seek  out  the  King  of  the  Titans,  whereupon 
Ravana  with  a  sneer  enquired  of  him : — 

"  What  is  the  meaning  of  thy  fettered  wings  ?  Why  are  thy 
flanks  torn  ?  Hast  thou  fallen  into  the  power  of  those  capricious 
monkeys  ?  " 

Thereupon  Shuka,  wrought  up  with  fear,  pressed  by  his 
exceedingly  powerful  sovereign,  made  this  reply  :— 

58 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

"  Repairing  to  the  northern  shore  of  the  sea  in  order  to  deliver 
thy  message  faithfully  by  employing  gentle  and  soothing  tones, 
those  barbarous  Plavamgamas,  barely  having  caught  sight  of  me, 
hurled  themselves  upon  me  and  began  to  beat  and  pound  me 
with  their  fists.  It  was  quite  impossible  to  enter  into  any  form 
of  mediation  with  them  or  discuss  anything ;  those  monkeys 
are  ferocious  and  violent  by  nature,  O  Lord  of  the  Titans ! 
The  slayer  of  Viradha,  Kabandha  and  Khara,  Rama,  however, 
who  is  accompanied  by  Sugriva,  is  searching  for  Sita.  Having 
thrown  a  bridge  over  the  sea  and  traversed  the  salty  waves,  that 
archer,  Raghava,  has  come  hither  and  sets  the  titans  at  nought. 

"  The  bears  and  monkeys,  gathering  in  thousands  of  divisions 
equal  to  mountains  or  clouds,  cover  the  earth.  There  is  no  more 
possibility  of  an  alliance  between  the  monkeys  and  the  titans 
than  between  a  God  and  a  demon  !  Before  they  reach  the 
ramparts  decide  quickly  how  thou  wilt  act ;  either  restore  Sita 
to  Rama  or  enter  into  conflict  with  him  !  " 

Thus  spoke  Shuka  and  Ravana,  his  eyes  red  with  anger, 
looked  at  him  as  if  he  would  consume  him  with  his  glance  and 
said: — 

"  Even  had  I  to  enter  into  conflict  with  the  Devas,  Gandharvas 
and  Danavas,  I  would  not  restore  Sita,  were  the  whole  earth  to 
shake !  When  will  my  shafts  fall  on  Raghava  as  the  intoxicated 
bees  fall  on  the  blossoming  trees  in  Spring  ?  When,  with  mine 
arrows,  shall  I  consume  his  body  flowing  with  blood  as  flaming 
torches  destroy  an  elephant. 

"  His  forces  will  suffer  eclipse  before  my  powerful  army  as  the 
brilliance  of  the  stars  at  the  rising  of  the  sun.  That  son  of 
Dasaratha  is  not  aware  that  I  possess  the  strength  of  Sagara 
and  the  swiftness  of  Manila,  that  is  why  he  desires  to  meet  me  in 
combat.  Rama  has  not  yet  seen  the  shafts  resembling  venomous 
serpents  that  repose  in  my  quiver ;  that  is  why  he  wishes  to  enter 
into  combat  with  me !  That  Raghava  is  not  yet  conversant 
with  my  great  might  nor  with  the  Vina  in  the  form  of  my  bow 
that  I  pluck  with  mine  arrows,  the  bow-string  producing  a 
formidable  sound,  the  cries  of  the  wounded  its  terrible  accom- 
paniment, the  darts  its  innumerable  notes  and  which,  when  I 
enter  the  river  of  the  enemy  ranks  as  into  a  vast  arena,  I  shall 
cause  to  resound  on  the  field  of  battle !

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"Neither  the  thousand-eyed  Vasava  in  person  nor  Yams  of 
the  fiery  missiles  nor  Vaishravana  himself  is  able  to  overcome  me 
in  battle ! " 


chapter   25 

Havana  sends  out  Shuka  and  Sarana  to  spy  on  the  Monkeys 

Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  having  traversed  the  ocean  with 
his  army,  the  boastful  Ravana  addressed  his  counsellors  Shuka 
and  Sarana,  saying  : — 

"  The  entire  army  of  monkeys  has  crossed  the  impassable 
ocean  on  a  bridge  constructed  by  Rama,  an  unprecedented 
exploit !  I  never  deemed  it  possible  to  throw  a  causeway  over 
the  sea! 

"Introduce  yourselves  into  their  ranks  without  being  dis- 
covered and  inform  meexactlyregardingthenumber  and  prowess 
of  those  monkey  leaders,  the  counsellors  who  customarily  attend 
on  Sugriva  and  Rama  and  the  scouts  and  warriors  among  them  ; 
further  how  the  dyke  was  constructed  over  the  waters  of  the  sea ; 
how  the  army  advances,  of  their  plans  and  of  the  strength  and 
weapons  used  by  Rama  and  the  courageous  Lakshmana." 

At  this  command,  the  two  Titans,  Shuka  and  Sarana,  assuming 
the  form  of  monkeys,  boldly  entered  into  the  simian  ranks  but 
they  were  unable  to  count  the  monkey  host  which  was  endowed 
with  unimaginable  energy  causing  the  hair  to  stand  on  end  and 
which  amidst  the  caves  and  waterfalls  spread  over  the  summits 
of  the  mountains.  From  every  side  those  divisions  came,  some 
having  crossed,  some  crossing  and  some  still  to  cross,  and  those 
who  were  arriving  or  had  still  to  come,  emitted  loud  roars  and, 
to  those  rangers  of  the  night,  resembled  the  infinite  sea. 

Now  the  illustrious  Bibishana  recognized  Shuka  and  Sarana 
under  their  disguise  and  arresting  them  denounced  them  to 
Rama,  saying : — 

"  Here  are  two  followers  of  the  King  of  the  Titans  who  have 
come  to  spy  out  conditions,  O  Conqueror  of  Hostile  Citadels  1  ** 
60 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Terrified  at  the  sight  of  Rama  and  despairing  of  their  lives, 
the  two  demons,  with  joined  palms,  said  to  him  in  great 
fear: — 

"  0  Most  Cherished  Issue  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  we  have 
been  sent  by  Ravana  to  find  out  about  the  whole  army !  " 

Hearing  these  words,  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  who 
delighted  in  the  welfare  of  all  beings,  smiling,  answered  them, 
saying: — 

"  If  you  have  inspected  the  whole  army  and  examined  their 
positions  carefully  and  fulfilled  the  mission  entrusted  to  you, 
then  return  in  peace.  But  if  there  is  anything  you  have  not 
investigated  and  you  still  wish  to  see,  then  Bibishana  will  show 
it  to  you  fully.  Your  arrest  should  not  cause  you  any  apprehen- 
sion with  regards  your  lives,  you  are  envoys  and,  having  laid 
aside  your  arms,  have  been  taken  captive ;  you  do  not  merit 
death! 

"  O  Bibishana,  set  these  two  rangers  of  the  night  free,  who  have 
come  in  disguise  to  spy  on  us  with  the  intention  of  creating 
division  amongst  their  foes.  And  you,  when  you  return  to  the 
great  Gty  of  Lanka,  repeat  my  words  faithfully  to  the  King  of  the 
Titans,  saying : — 

" '  That  force  on  which  thou  didst  rely  when  taking  Sita  away 
from  me,  employ  freely  with  the  aid  of  thy  troops  and  allies. 
To-morrow  at  break  of  day,  thou  shalt  see  mine  arrows  demolish 
the  City  of  Lanka  with  its  ramparts  and  arches  as  well  as  the  army 
of  titans  !  My  dreadful  ire  will  fall  on  thee  and  thy  forces  at 
dawn,  O  Ravana,  as  the  God  bearing  the  Thunderbolt, Vasava, 
discharges  it  on  the  Danavas!'" 

Receiving  this  command,  the  two  Titans,  Shuka  and  Sarana, 
admiring  his  justice,  cried  out : — "  Mayest  thou  be  victorious  1 " 
and  paid  obeisance  to  Rama. 
Returning  to  Lanka,  they  said  to  the  Lord  of  the  Titans  : — 
"  Bibishana  took  us  captive  with  the  intention  of  slaying  us, 
O  King,  but  Rama,  he  whose  valour  is  immeasurable,  seeing  us, 
let  us  go ! 

"In  that  place  four  of  the  foremost  monkey  leaders  are 

assembled  who  are  equal  to  the  Protector  of  the  Worlds.    Their 

warriors,  skilled  in  the  use  of  weapons,  of  proved  prowess,  are 

Rama  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  the  fortunate  Lakshmana,  Bibishana 

61 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  the  highly  energetic  Sugriva,  whose  strength  is  equal  to  the 
great  Indra's. 

"Even  without  the  monkeys  themselves  taking  part,  they  are 
able  to  penetrate  into  this  City  of  Lanka  with  its  walls  and  arches 
and  tear  up  the  foundations  and  transplant  them  elsewhere. 
Such  is  Rama's  capacity  and  such  his  weapons  that  he  could 
overthrow  the  city  single-handed,  his  three  companions  standing 
by !  Under  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sugriva's  protection  that 
army  is  completely  invincible  even  against  the  Gods  and  Asuras 
combined !  Now  that  army  of  powerful  and  aggressive 
monkeys,  dwellers  in  the  woods,  is  breathing  war  ;  it  is  useless 
to  dispute  with  them.  Make  peace  and  restore  Maithili  to  the 
son  of  Dasaratha !  " 


chapter  26 

Sarana  tells  Ravana  of  the  principal  Leaders  of  the  Monkeys 

Hearing  the  sincere  and  courageous  utterance  of  Sarana,  the 
King  Ravana,  answered  :— 

"  Even  did  the  Gods,  Gandharvas  and  Danavas  unitedly  seek 
to  attack  me  and  were  all  beings  to  tremble,  I  would  not  restore 
Sita .;  O  Friend,  having  been  roughly  handled  by  the  monkeys 
thou  dost  fear  them  and  for  this  deemest  it  opportune  for  me  to 
give  up  Sita  !    What  adversary  is  able  to  overcome  me  in  war  ?  " 

Having  uttered  this  arrogant  speech,  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the 
Titans,  in  order  to  survey  the  horizon,  proudly  went  up  to  his 
palace  that  was  as  white  as  snow  and  as  high  as  innumerable 
palm  trees.  Accompanied  by  his  ministers,  Ravana,  who  was 
transported  with  anger,  swept  the  mountains,  forests  and  ocean 
with  his  glance  and  he  beheld  the  entire  region  covered  with 
Plavamgamas. 

Seeing  that  illimitable  and  invincible  army  of  monkeys, 
Ravana  enquired  of  Sarana,  saying  : — 

"  Who  are  the  leaders  of  these  monkeys  ?  Who  are  their 
warriors  ?  Who  their  princes  ?  Who  are  those  marching  at 
their  head  in  order  to  demonstrate  their  valour?  Who  are 
62 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Sugriva's  counsellors  and  his  generals  ?  Tell  me  all,  O  Sarana  ! 
What  is  the  strength  of  these  monkeys  ?  " 

Sarana,  thus  interrogated  by  that  Sovereign  of  the  Titans 
being  well-informed,  pointed  out  the  leaders  of  those  dwellers 
in  the  woods  to  him. 

He  said :  "  That  monkey  who  stands  before  Lanka  roaring 
amidst  a  hundred  thousand  leaders  who  escort  him,  whose 
powerful  voice  shatters  the  whole  city  with  its  walls,  gates  and 
arches,  its  rocks,  forests  and  jungles  and  who  is  in  command  of 
the  army  of  the  magnanimous  Sugriva,  Lord  of  all  the  Deer  of 
the  Trees,  is  the  valiant  General  NUa. 

"  He  who  holds  his  arms  high  and  who  tramples  the  earth  under 
his  feet  as  he  marches,  that  hero  whose  face  is  turned  towards 
Lanka  and  who,  in  fury,  yawns  convulsively,  who  resembles 
the  peak  of  a  mountain  in  stature  and  the  filaments  of  a  lotus  in 
hue,  who,  in  an  excess  of  anger,  continuously  lashes  out  with 
his  tail,  the  swish  of  which  is  heard  in  the  ten  regions,  that 
warrior  whom  Sugtiva,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  installed  as 
heir-apparent,  is  named  Angada  and  he  is  challenging  thee  to 
combat.  That  warrior,  the  equal  of  his  sire,  Bali,  is  beloved  of 
Sugriva  and  as  devoted  to  Raghava's  interests  as  Varuna  is  to 
Shakra's.  That  Janaka's  daughter  has  been  seen  by  Hanuman, 
who  is  as  swift  as  the  wind  and  the  servant  of  Raghava,  is  all  due 
to  the  advice  of  Angada.  Having  formed  innumerable  battalions 
with  the  foremost  of  monkeys,  that  warrior  is  marching  against 
thee  at  the  head  of  his  army  in  order  to  destroy  thee. 

"Close  to  Bali's  son  and  himself  surrounded  by  a  considerable 
number  of  troops,  the  valiant  Nala,  the  builder  of  the  bridge, 
stands  ready  on  the  battlefield. 

"  Those  soldiers  clad  in  saffron  colour,  who  are  stretching  their 
limbs,  roaring  and  gnashing  their  teeth,  are  following  the  one 
who  boasts  that  he  will  overthrow  Lanka  with  his  forces :  it  is 
Shveta  of  silver  hue,  who  is  exceedingly  agile  and  brave ;  that 
intelligent  monkey,  a  warrior  renowned  in  the  Three  Worlds 
has  come  to  take  his  orders  from  Sugriva  and  will  leave  at  once 
to  place  the  army  of  monkeys  in  strategic  positions  and  inspire 
enthusiasm  amongst  his  divisions.

joyfully  draws  in  his  train  hundreds  and  thousands  of  warriors 
with  long  hair  and  immense  tails  hanging  down,  who  are 
coppery-coloured,  yellow,  black,  white  and  matted,  hideous  to 
look  upon,  is  the  intrepid  Monkey  Kanda.  He  yearns  to  fight 
and  boasts  that  he  will  destroy  Lanka  with  his  forces. 

"The  third,  who  resembles  a  tawny  lion  with  a  great  mane 
and  whose  gaze  is  fixed  attentively  on  the  city  as  if  he  wished  to 
consume  it  with  his  glances,  who  dwells  mostly  on  the  Mountains 
Krishna  and  Sahya  of  the  Vindhya  Range  of  pleasing  aspect,  is 
the  General  Rambha,  O  King.  Three  hundred  koris  of  the 
most  valiant  of  monkeys  who  are  formidable,  impetuous,  burning 
with  ardour  surround  him  and  follow  in  his  steps  for  the  purpose 
of  causing  the  destruction  of  Lanka  by  their  blows. 

"The  one  who  is  shaking  his  ears  and  yawning  continuously, 
who,  when  facing  death  remains  immoveable  and  who  never 
retreats  in  the  face  of  a  hostile  army  but  eyeing  them  askance 
foams  with  rage ;  he  who  lashes  out  with  his  tail  and  gnashes 
his  teeth,  that  hero  of  immense  energy,  wholly  devoid  of  fear, 
O  King,  has  his  abode  on  the  ravishing  Mountain  of  the  Salveyas

the  midst  of  the  monkeys,  who  is  eager  to  fight,  dwells  in 
Pariyatra,  a  mountain  that  is  exceeded  by  none  in  height ; 
that  general  ever  invincible  in  combat  is  named  Panasa.  That

ochre,  who,  in  the  pride  of  his  strength  ever  holds  the  other 
monkeys  in  contempt,  is  the  illustrious  Gavaya.  He  is  advancing

CHAPTER    27 

Sarana  continues  his  Deposition 

"  I  shall  describe  these  valiant  leaders  that  thou  art  able  to 
see,  who  are  devoted  to  Raghava,  full  of  prowess  and  who  count 
their  lives  as  nought.  That  one,  the  hairs  adhering  to  whose 
enormous  tail  are  coppery,  yellow,  black,  white  and  hideously 
matted  and  that  stand  on  end,  a  tail  that  brilliant  as  the  sun's 
rays  brushes  the  earth  as  he  advances,  is  the  Monkey  Hara. 
He  is  followed  by  hundreds  and  thousands  of  monkeys  brandish- 
ing trees,  awaiting  the  moment  to  attack  Lanka ;  they  are  the 
leaders  of  the  Monkey  King  and  in  the  service  of  the  Simian 
government. 

"  Those  warriors,  whom  thou  perceivest  in  such  incalculable 
numbers,  that  are  no  more  able  to  be  counted  than  the  sands  on 
the  limitless  shores  of  the  sea  and  who  cover  the  mountains, 
plains  and  rivers,  ranged  like  sombre  clouds,  black  as  collyrium, 
extremely  ferocious  and  valiant  fighters,  are  the  bears ; 
observe  how  they  are  advancing  to  confront  thee,  O  King.  In 
their  midst,  surrounded  on  every  side  by  them,  like  Parjanya 
by  storm  clouds,  is  their  sovereign  of  dreadful  glance  and 
fearful  aspect ;  he  inhabits  Rikshavat,  a  very  high  mountain 
and  goes  to  slake  his  thirst  at  the  Narmada  River ;  he  is  the  lord 
of  all  the  bears  and  his  name  is  Dhumra  !  He  has  a  brother,

younger  than  he,  who  resembles  him  in  stature  but  who  far 
surpasses  him  in  valour ;  behold  him,  Jambavan,  like  unto  a 
mountain !  Of  controlled  senses,  he  is  full  of  reverence  for 
his  spiritual  superiors  and  implacable  in  combat.  His  intelli- 
gence greatly  assisted  Shakra  in  the  war  between  the  Gods  and 
the  titans  and  he  was  the  recipient  of  many  boons.  These 
giants  hurl  down  great  rocks  as  large  as  clouds  from  the  mountain 
heights,  which  they  have  scaled,  nor  do  they  tremble  in  the  face 
of  death.  Shaggy,  resembling  Rakshasas  or  Pisachas,  those 
warriors  of  surpassing  energy  roam  about  in  great  numbers. 
And  that  commander  on  whom  the  eyes  of  the  monkeys  are 
fixed,  who  now  leaps  up  in  fury  and  then  stands  motionless, 
that  foremost  of  monkeys,  O  King,  dwells  on  the  Sahasraksha 
Mountain,  and  the  name  of  that  exceedingly  valiant  leader  is 
Rambha. 

"  He  who,  walking  on  all  fours  touches  the  mountain  a  league 
away  with  his  flanks,  whose  chest  is  a  league  in  height,  who  is  not 
surpassed  by  any  quadruped  in  beauty  is  the  renowned 
Samnadana,  the  Grandsire  of  the  Monkeys.  Extremely  skilful, 
he  formerly  entered  into  combat  with  Shakra  on  the  battlefield, 
who  was  unable  to  defeat  him,  such  is  that  superior  leader. 

"  Another  whose  valour  equals  Indra's  on  the  battlefield  was 
born  of  a  youthful  Gandharva  maiden  and  Krishna vartman. 
In  the  struggle  between  the  Devas  and  Asuras  he  brought  help 
to  the  Celestials.  That  illustrious  one  sits  beneath  the  Jambhu 
tree  on  that  mountain,  the  King  of  Peaks,1  frequented  by 
Kinneras,  which  constantly  affords  delight  to  thy  brother,  O 
Lord  of  the  Titans.  It  is  near  there  that  that  fortunate  one,  that 
powerful  Lord  of  the  Monkeys,  General  Krathana,  whose 
prowess  is  not  confined  to  words  and  who  ever  eschews  defeat, 
sports.  He  is  standing  surrounded  by  thousands  of  monkeys  ; 
he  also  undertakes  to  crush  Lanka  1 

"  The  one  who  usually  roams  by  the  Ganges,  sowing  terror 
among  the  elephants,  remembering,  as  he  does,  the  old  quarrel 
between  elephants  and  monkeys,  that  leader  with  a  voice  of 
thunder,  who  dwells  in  the  mountain  caves,  subduing  the  tuskers 
in  the  woods  and  uprooting  the  trees,  that  Prince  of  Monkeys, 
like  unto  Indra  himself,  passes  his  life  happily  at  the  head  of  a

host  of  monkeys  by  the  river  that  issues  from  the  Himalayas  or 
Ushirabija,  otherwise  Mandara,  the  highest  of  mountains. 
Hundreds  and  thousands  and  millions  of  monkeys,  proud  of 
their  strength  and  agility,  full  of  prowess  and  fire,  roaring  loudly, 
follow  that  indomitable  warrior,  their  leader,  named  Pramathin. 
It  is  he,  resembling  a  great  cloud  propelled  by  the  wind,  whom 
thou  hast  pointed  out,  surrounded  by  a  furious  band  of  intrepid 
monkeys  who  stir  up  a  cloud  of  yellow-coloured  dust  which  the 
wind  carries  in  all  directions.  Those  formidable  and  powerful 
black-snouted  Golangulas,  numbering  a  hundred  times  a  hundred 
thousand,  who,  having  assisted  in  the  construction  of  the 
causeway,  have  gathered  growling  round  the  General  of  the 
Golangulas,  named  Gavaksha,  threaten  to  demolish  Lanka 
themselves.  There  where,  frequented  by  bees,  the  trees  yield 
fruit  in  every  season,  on  that  mountain  encircled  by  the  sun,  the 
brightness  of  which  it  equals,  the  radiance  of  which  shed  on 
beast  and  bird,  lends  them  the  same  brilliance,  whose  plateaus 
are  never  forsaken  by  the  magnanimous  and  great  Rishis,  whose 
trees  are  laden  with  fruit  possessed  of  every  desirable  savour, 
where  exceedingly  rare  honey  abounds;  on  that  golden  and 
ravishing  mountain,  the  General  Kesharin  lives  amidst  those 
delights,  O  King. 

"  There  are  sixty  thousand  wonderful  golden  mountains  in  the 
midst  of  which  Savarnimeru  stands  out,  as  thou  amongst  the 
titans,  O  Ring  !  It  is  on  that  mountain,  that  brown,  white  and 
copper-coloured  monkeys  or  those  yellow  as  honey  dwell,  who 
possess  pointed  teeth  and  nails  and  who  resemble  lions ;  they 
are  as  indomitable  as  tigers,  the  equals  of  Vaishvanara,  with 
their  long  coiled  tails  like  unto  serpents  vomiting  poison  or  like 
elephants  intoxicated  with  ichor  as  high  as  great  hills,  and  they 
roar  like  thunder ;  their  eyes  are  grey  and  round  and  when  they 
are  on  the  march  they  create  an  appalling  uproar ;  all  of  them 
stand  looking  on  Lanka  as  if  they  were  about  to  destroy  it.  In 
their  midst  is  the  powerful  leader  who  ever  faces  the  sun ;  he  is 
eager  to  conquer  thee ;  his  name  is  renowned  in  the  world,  it  is 
Shatabali,  O  King,  and  he  swears  to  destroy  Lanka  with  his 
troops.  Courageous,  powerful,  full  of  daring,  he  prides  himself 
on  his  personal  valour.  In  his  devotion  to  Rama  that  monkey 
will  not  spare  his  life.

inhabitants  of  the  Vindhya  Range.  All,  O  Great  King,  are 
exceedingly  powerful,  their  stature  is  equal  to  high  hills  and  all

Shuka    in    his    turn    enumerates    the    Enemy 

Sarana  having  described  the  forces  of  the  enemy  to  Havana,  the 
Lord  of  the  Titans,  Shuka,  in  his  turn,  took  up  the  tale,  saying : — 

"  Dost  thou  observe  those  resembling  elephants  intoxicated 
with  ichor,  rising  up  like  banian  trees  on  the  banks  of  the  Ganges 
or  Sala  Trees  on  the  Himalayas  ? 

"  O  King,  those  warriors,  able  to  change  their  form  at  will,  are 
irresistible,  equal  to  the  Daityas  and  Danavas  and,  in  war,  are 
endowed  with  the  valour  of  the  Gods.  They  number  twenty-one 
million  or  more ;  they  are  Sugriva's  companions  and  Kishkindha 
is  their  accustomed  abode ;  those  monkeys  born  of  the  Gods  and 
Gandharvas  are  capable  of  assuming  different  shapes  at  will. 

"  The  two  who  stand  there,  who  resemble  each  other  and  nave 
the  appearance  of  Gods,  are  Mainda  and  Dvivida,  none  is  their 
equal  in  combat.  Sanctioned  by  Brahma,  they  have  drunk  the 
water  of  immortality  and  they  boast  that  they  will  demolish 
Lanka  by  their  own  prowess. 

"  As  for  that  monkey  whom  thou  seest  there,  resembling  an 
intoxicated  elephant,  who  in  strength  and  fury  is  able  to  churn 
up  the  ocean  itself,  it  is  he  who  came  to  Lanka  to  find  Vaidehi  and 
spy  on  thee,  O  Lord.  That  monkey  whom  thou  perceivest,  has 
returned,  he  is  the  eldest  son  of  Kesarin  and  his  sire  is  said  to 
be  Vayu ;  he  is  Hanuman,  who  crossed  the  ocean.  Able  to 
change  his  shape  at  will,  that  handsome  and  courageous  warrior 
is  no  more  able  to  be  stayed  in  his  course  than  Satataga1  himself.

"While  yet  a  child,  seeing  the  sun  rise,  he  desired  to  eat  it  and, 
springing  up,  followed  it  to  a  distance  of  three  thousand  leagues, 
reflecting : — *  I  shall  seize  hold  of  Aditya  and  my  hunger  will 
be  appeased  forever ! '  In  this  thought,  intoxicated  with  his 
own  strength,  he  leapt  into  the  air  but  was  unable  to  reach  that 
God,  who  is  invincible  even  to  the  Celestials,  Rishis  and  Demons, 
and  he  fell  on  the  mountain  where  that  radiant  orb  rises.  In  his 
fall  he  fractured  his  jaw  slightly  on  a  rock  and  on  account  of  the 
strength  of  his  jaw  he  was  called  Hanuman ! 

"  By  associating  with  those  monkeys  I  was  enabled  to  learn  his 
history,  yet  I  am  quite  unable  to  describe  his  prowess,  beauty 
and  vigour  adequately.  He  plumes  himself  on  being  able  to 
destroy  Lanka  single-handed  ;  it  was  he  who  formerly  set  fire  to 
the  city ;  how  is  it  that  thou  dost  not  remember  him  ? 

"  Nearby  is  a  warrior,  dark  of  hue  with  eyes  like  lotuses,  the 
Atiratha1  among  the  Ikshvakus ;  his  heroism  is  well  known  in 
the  world ;  his  sense  of  duty  never  wavers  nor  does  he  ever 
swerve  from  righteousness ;  he  knows  how  to  loose  Brahma's 
weapon  and  is  conversant  with  the  Veda  ;  indeed  he  is  the  most 
learned  of  Vedic  scholars ;  he  shatters  the  firmament  with  his 
arrows  and  rends  the  earth;  his  ire  is  equal  to  Mrityu's  and  he 
resembles  Indra  in  valour ;  his  consort  is  Sita,  whom  thou  didst 
bear  away  from  Janasthana ;  he  is  Rama,  who  has  come  to  wage 
war  on  thee,  O  Ring. 

"  He  who  stands  on  his  right,  radiant  as  gold  refined  in  the 
crucible,  with  a  broad  chest,  reddened  eyes  and  dark  curly 
locks,  is  Lakshmana,  who  is  devoted  to  his  brother's  interests 
and  fortune ;  a  general  and  a  seasoned  soldier,  he  knows  better 
than  any  how  to  handle  every  weapon.  Full  of  ardour, 
invincible,  victorious,  brave,  accustomed  to  success  and 
powerful,  he  has  ever  been  Rama's  right  hand  and  his  very 
life's  breath.  Where  it  concerns  Raghava  he  would  never  be 
the  one  to  seek  to  preserve  his  life.  He  has  also  sworn  to 
exterminate  all  the  titans  in  battle. 

"  He  who  stands  on  Rama's  left  and  who  is  surrounded  by  a 
group  of  titans,  is  Bibishana,  whom  that  king  of  kings  has 
installed  as  sovereign  of  Lanka ;  he,  filled  with  ire,  is  advancing 
in  order  to  enter  into  conflict  with  thee  !

"  The  other  whom  thou  seest  standing  in  the  centre  like  an 
immoveable  rock,  rules  over  the  foremost  of  those  deer  of  tht 
branches ;  his  prowess  is  immeasurable ;  for  energy,  glory, 
intelligence,  strength  and  nobility,  he  stands  out  among  those 
monkeys  as  Himavat  amongst  the  mountains.  He  dwells  with 
the  principal  monkey  leaders  in  Kishkindha  with  its  groves  and 
trees,  an  inaccessible  citadel  of  impenetrable  approaches, 
excavated  from  the  mountains.  He  wears  a  golden  chain, 
wrought  with  a  hundred  lotuses  in  which  Lakshmi,  who  sym- 
bolises prosperity,  beloved  of  Gods  and  men,  dwells.  That

Ravana  sends  out  fresh   Spies 

Beholding  those  foremost  of  monkey  leaders  pointed  out  by 
Shuka — the  valiant  Lakshmana,  Rama's  right  arm,  his  own 
brother  Bibishana  standing  close  to  Raghava,  the  King  of  all 
the  Monkeys,  Sugriva,  of  exceeding  prowess,  the  heroic  Angada, 
grandson  of  the  Bearer  of  the  Thunderbolt,  the  powerful 
Hanuman  and  the  invincible  Jambavan,  Sushena,  Kumuda, 
Nila  and  Nala,  those  paragons  among  the  monkeys,  Gaja, 
Gavaksha,  Sharabna,  Mainda  and  Dvivtda — Ravana,  his  heart 
agitated,  became  enraged  and  began  to  inveigh  against  those  two 
heroes,  Shuka  and  Sarana,  who  had  completed  their  report. 

In  a  voice  strangled  with  fury,  he  overwhelmed  them  with 
reproaches  as  they  stood  with  bowed  heads  before  him,  saying : — 

"  In  sooth  it  is  scarcely  fitting  that  such  unpleasing  words 
should  be  uttered  by  loyal  servants  to  their  king  who  has  the 
power  to  mete  out  punishment  or  reward.  That  you  should 
both  hymn  the  praises  of  the  foe  belonging  to  an  alien  race  who 
has  come  here  to  attack  me,  is  unbecoming !  In  vain  have  you 
sat  at  the  feet  of  your  elders,  spiritual  preceptors  and  the  aged, 
since  the  essential  traditions  of  the  scriptures  do  not  rule  your 
lives  or,  if  you  have  imbibed  them,  you  have  not  remembered 
them ;  you  are  over-burdened  with  ignorance !  Having  such 
unintelligent  servants  as  you  are,  it  is  a  miracle  that  I  am  still 
able  to  wield  the  sceptre.  Have  you  no  fear  of  death  that  you 
dare  address  me  thus  insolently,  I,  whose  tongue  dispenses 
good  and  evil  ? 

"Even  in  contact  with  fire,  the  forest  trees  may  remain 
standing  but  an  evil-doer  cannot  escape  the  condemnation  of  his 
sovereign !  Did  the  remembrance  of  your  past  services  not 
moderate  mine  ire,  I  should  certainly  punish  you  miserable 
wretches  by  death,  who  thus  hymn  the  praises  of  mine 
adversaries. 

"  Begone !  Go  hence,  leave  my  presence !  Having  regard  for 
your  past  services  I  shall  not  put  you  to  death.    You  are  already 

71 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

dead,  ungrateful  creatures,  since  you  have  no  devotion  for  me !  " 

Hearing  these  accusations,  which  covered  them  with  confusion, 
Shuka  and  Sarana  paid  obeisance  to  Ravana,  saying : — "  Be 
thou  victorious !  "  and  withdrew. 

Then  Dashagriva  said  to  Mahodara  who  stood  beside  him : — 
"  Bring  me  other  emissaries  quickly !  " 

At  this  command,  that  Ranger  of  the  Night,  Mahodara, 
without  delay  summoned  spies  and  these  presenting  themselves 
in  all  haste  before  the  king,  hailed  him  with  joined  palms  and 
expressed  their  desire  to  see  him  victorious. 

Thereupon  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  said  to  those 
agents  who  were  full  of  confidence,  courage  and  zeal  and  were 
fearless : — 

"  Go  and  find  out  Rama's  plans,  who  are  his  ministers  and 
who  stand  nearest  to  him  in  counsel  and  friendship,  what  are 
his  hours  of  sleeping  and  waking  and  what  he  intends  to  do  next. 

"A  wise  monarch  who  discovers  all  that  concerns  his  adversary 
through  his  spies,  needs  to  exert  himself  only  to  a  moderate 
degree  to  overcome  his  enemy  on  the  field  of  battle." 

"May  it  be  so!"  answered  the  emissaries  full  of  joy  and, 
placing  Shardula  at  their  head,  they  honoured  their  sovereign 
by  circumambulating  him.  Having  paid  obeisance  to  that 
powerful  Lord  of  the  Titans,  those  spies  set  out  for  where  Rama 
and  Lakshmana  were  to  be  found. 

Leaving  in  disguise  they  observed  Rama,  Lakshmana, 
Sugriva  and  Bibishana  near  the  Mountain  Suvela.  Beholding 
that  army  they  were  seized  with  terror  and  as  they  stood  there, 
the  righteous  Prince  of  the  Titans,  Bibishana,  recognized  them 
and  arrested  them  but  Shardula  alone  was  held  captive, 
Bibishana  saying : — "  This  one  is  the  traitor !  '* 

Rama  however  released  Shardula  also,  who  was  being 
harassed  by  the  monkeys,  having  already  in  his  compassion  given 
the  other  titans  their  freedom. 

Beaten  by  those  impetuous  and  agile  monkeys,  they  returned 
to  Lanka,  groaning  and  beside  themselves  :  and  those  emissaries, 
valiant  rangers  of  the  night,  who  were  wont  to  penetrate  inn) 
enemy  territory,  returned  to  Dashagriva  and  informed  him  that 
Rama's  army  was  camping  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the  Suvela 
Mountain.

CHAPTER    30 

Sfiardula  gives  an  Account  of  his  Mission  to  Ravana 

The  King  of  Lanka's  spies  informed  him  that  Rama  was  camping 
with  his  great  army  near  Mount  Suvela  and,  hearing  from  them 
of  Rama's  approach  at  the  head  of  a  vast  host,  he  was  perturbed 
and  said  to  Shardula : — 

"  Thou  appearest  to  be  unmanned  which  is  alien  to  thy 
nature,  O  Ranger  of  the  Night !  Can  it  be  that  thou  hast  fallen 
a  victim  to  those  savage  monkeys  ?  " 

Thus  questioned  by  that  tiger  among  the  titans,  Shardula, 
trembling  with  fear,  answered  in  a  faint  voice,  saying : — 

"  O  King,  it  is  impossible  to  spy  on  those  lions  among  the 
monkeys,  who  are  full  of  energy  and  prowess  and  protected  by 
Raghava  nor  can  one  interrogate  them  in  order  to  find  out 
anything !  On  all  sides  the  approaches  are  guarded  by  monkeys 
as  big  as  hills. 

"  Scarcely  had  I  penetrated  into  their  ranks  when  I  was  recog- 
nized and  forcibly  seized  and  myself  interrogated  in  every  way 
by  those  monkeys,  who  attacked  me  with  their  knees,  fists, 
teeth  and  the  palms  of  their  hands ;  thereafter  I  was  led  through 
the  entire  army  by  those  pitiless  monkeys  who,  having  paraded 
me  everywhere,  brought  me  into  Rama's  presence,  exhausted 
and  bewildered,  my  limbs  covered  with  blood  and  wounds. 
They  wished  to  murder  me  despite  my  supplications  made 
with  joined  palms,  when,  fortunately  I  was  saved  by  Rama  who 
cried  *  Stay !  *  *  Stay ! ' 

"That  prince  who  has  filled  the  sea  with  boulders  and  crags  is 
encamped  at  the  gates  of  Lanka,  well  equipped  with  weapons, 
his  forces  arranged  in  the  form  of  Garuda1  and  he  is  surrounded 
on  all  sides  by  monkeys.  Having  set  me  free,  he  is  there  full  of 
energy  advancing  on  Lanka  I  Ere  he  reaches  the  ramparts, 
do  one  thing  or  the  other  with  all  speed,  either  return  Sita  to 
him  immediately  or  give  him  battle  ! "

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Having  reflected  on  what  he  had  just  heard,  the  King  of  the 
Titans,  Ravana,  made  this  significant  reply : — 

**  Even  were  the  Gods,  Gandharvas  and  Danavas  to  arraign 
themselves  against  me  and  were  the  whole  world  in  peril,  I 
would  not  restore  Sita." 

Then  that  exceedingly  powerful  one  added : — 

"  Thou  hast  explored  the  ranks  of  their  army,  who  are  the 
warriors  among  the  Plavamgamas  ?  What  is  the  measure  of 
their  prowess  ?  Who  are  these  invincible  monkeys  ?  Whose 
sons  and  grandsons  are  they  ?  Tell  me  the  truth,  0  Faithful 
Friend ! " 

Thus  interrogated,  Shardula,  the  most  skilled  of  envoys, 
began  to  speak  thus  in  Ravana's  presence : — 

"  First  there  is  the  son  of  Riksharajas,  invincible  in  war,  O 
King,  and  the  son  of  Gadgada.  There  follows  another  son  of 
Gadgada  and  the  son  of  the  spiritual  preceptor  of  Shatakratu, 
the  father  of  the  monkey  who  slew  so  many  titans.  Thereafter 
comes  the  virtuous  Sushena,  the  valiant  son  of  Dharma,  then 
Saumya  born  of  Soma,  O  King,  and  the  monkey  Dadimukha 
and  Sumukha,  Durmukha  and  Vegadarshin,  the  equals  of 
Mrityu,  whom  Swyambhu  formerly  begot  in  the  form  of 
monkeys,  and  further  there  is  the  great  Nila  himself,  the  son 
of  the  Bearer  of  the  Sacrificial  Offerings1  and  the  son  of  the 
Wind,  Hanuman.  Then  there  is  the  grandson  of  Shakra,  the 
youthful,  invincible  and  courageous  Angada,  and  Mainda  and 
Dvivida  who  are  both  valiant  and  equal  to  the  Ashvins.  Five 
are  the  sons  of  Vivasvata  who  resembles  Time  as  the  Destroyer, 
Gaja,  Gavaya,  Gavaksha,  Sharabha  and  Gandharaadana. 

"  There  are  ten  kotis  of  monkeys  full  of  prowess  and  martial 
ardour  and  I  was  unable  to  count  the  rest  of  those  fortunate 
children  of  the  Gods. 

"  That  son  of  Dasaratha  with  the  body  of  a  lion,  that  youth, 
Rama,  to  whom  none  in  the  world  can  be  compared  for  valour, 
slew  Dushana,  Khara,  Trishiras  and  Viradha  who  fell  under 
his  blows,  as  also  Kabandha,  the  equal  of  Antaka.  No  one  is 
able  to  describe  Rama's  qualities  by  whom  the  titans  who  went 
to  Janasthana  were  slain.

of  elephants,  Matanga,  in  the  path  of  whose  shafts  Vasava 
himself  could  not  survive !  There  are  also  Shveta  and 
Jyotirmukha,  both  born  of  Bhashkara  and  the  son  of  Varuna,  the 
monkey  Hemaketu.  The  heroic  son  of  Vishvakarma,  the 
foremost  of  monkeys  Nala,  and  the  impetuous  son  of  Vasu, 
Durdhara. 

"  Finally  there  is  that  prince  of  the  titans,  thy  brother  Bibishana, 
on  whom  Rama  has  conferred  the  City  of  Lanka  as  the  reward 
for  his  devotion.  Thus  I  have  described  the  entire  army  of 
monkeys  stationed  on  the  Mount  Suvela ;  it  is  for  thee  to  decide 
what  remains  to  be  done !  "

Havana  deceives  Sita  about  the  Death  of  Rama 

Meanwhile  the  king's  spies  spread  the  tidings  in  Lanka  that 
Raghava  was  encamped  with  his  powerful  forces  on  Mount 
Suvela. 

Ravana,  who  knew,  through  bis  emissaries,  of  Rama's  arrival 
at  the  head  of  a  vast  army,  somewhat  perturbed,  said  to  his 
attendants  :— 

"  Let  all  the  ministers  assemble  here  immediately !  O  Titans, 
the  time  has  come  to  take  counsel  together !  " 

On  this  command,  his  counsellors  instantly  came  together 
and  he  entered  into  conference  with  those  loyal  titans,  then, 
having  duly  deliberated  with  them  concerning  the  immediate 
measures  to  be  taken,  Durdharsha1  dismissed  them  all  and 
returned  to  his  abode. 

Taking  with  him  the  Titan  Vidyujjihva,  a  powerful  and  skilled 
magician,  he  turned  his  steps  towards  the  place  where  Maithili 
was  to  be  found.  Thereafter  the  King  of  the  Titans  said  to 
Vidyujjihva,  who  was  proficient  in  magic  : — 

"  With  thy  spells,  create  an  illusion  in  order  to  deceive 
Janaka's  daughter!    Do  thou   produce  a   head   resembling 

1  Durdharsha-— A  name  given  to  Havana  meaning  'Dreadful, 
Unapproachable '. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Raghava's  and  a  mighty  bow,  its  arrows  set,  and  then  present 
thyself  before  me !  " 

On  this  command,  that  Ranger  of  the  Night,  Vidyujjihva, 
answered  "  Be  it  so "  and  displayed  his  powers  as  a  magician, 
whereupon  Ravana,  satisfied,  bestowed  rich  attire  upon  him. 

In  his  impatience  to  behold  Sita  once  again,  that  mighty 
monarch  of  the  Nairritas  entered  the  Ashoka  Grove  and  the 
younger  brother  of  Dhanada  beheld  that  unfortunate  One  who 
did  not  deserve  her  fate,  her  head  bowed,  plunged  in  grief, 
lying  on  the  ground  in  the  Ashoka  Grove  where  she  had  been 
banished,  absorbed  in  the  thought  of  her  lord,  hideous  titan 
women  seated  not  far  distant  from  her. 

Then  Ravana,  approaching,  manifested  his  gratification  and 
addressed  that  daughter  of  Janaka  in  confident  tones,  saying  : — 
"  O  Beautiful  One,  he  in  whom  thou  didst  trust  at  the  time 
when  thou  didst  repel  me  when  I  sought  to  console  thee,  that 
murderer  of  Khara,  thy  consort  Raghava,  has  been  slain  in 
combat.  Thy  roots  are  completely  severed  and  thy  pride 
humbled  by  me ;  in  consequence  of  the  calamity  that  has  over- 
taken thee,  thou  art  mine  I  Give  up  thy  resolution  therefore, 
what  wilt  thou  do  with  one  dead  ?  O  Beautiful  One,  become  the 
chief  Queen  over  all  my  consorts,  thou  who  till  now  hast 
enjoyed  so  little  happiness,  thou  who  art  without  resources  !  O 
Foolish  One,  who  deemest  thyself  wise,  hear  how,  like  unto 
the  destruction  of  Vritra,  thy  lord  was  slain ! 

"  In  order  to  destroy  me,  Raghava  alighted  on  the  shore  of  the 
sea  surrounded  by  a  vast  army  assembled  by  the  King  of  the 
Monkeys.  Having  ranged  the  northern  shore  with  his  great 
legions,  Rama  struck  camp  when  the  sun  set.  Sending  out 
my  spies  to  reconnoitre,  they  came  upon  that  host  stationed 
there  overcome  with  fatigue,  fast  asleep  at  midnight.. 

"  Under  the  command  of  Frahasta,  my  great  forces  destroyed 
them  during  the  night  and  Rama  and  Lakshmana  were  amongst 
them.  The  titans,  wielding  harpoons,  maces,  discus,  daggers, 
sticks,  great  arrows,  spears,  shining  Kutamudgaras,  picks, 
lances,  darts,  millstones,  massed  weapons  and  a  hail  of  missiles, 
made  use  of  them  again  and  again  in  order  to  stiike  down  the 
monkeys.  Thereafter  the  impetuous  Prahasta  with  a  steady 
hand  severed  the  head  of  the  sleeping  prince  with  his  sword, 
76 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

"  Bibishana,  who  was  wandering  about  aimlessly,  was  taken 
captive  whilst  Lakshmana  and  the  monkey  warriors  fled  in  all 
directions.  Sugriva,  the  King  of  the  Plavagas  had  his  neck 
broken,  O  Sita ;  Hanuman  of  the  fractured  jaw  was  slain  by  the 
titans.  Jamba  van,  while  attempting  to  rise  from  his  knees 
perished  in  the  m&ee  like  an  axed  tree  pierced  by  innumerable 
harpoons.  Mainda  and  Dvivida,  those  two  great  scourgers  of 
their  foes,  the  foremost  of  monkeys,  groaning  and  breathless, 
their  limbs  bathed  in  blood  were  cut  to  pieces  by  the  sword,  and 
Panasa,  crying  for  help,  was  stretched  on  the  earth  under  a  tree 
of  the  same  name.  Pierced  by  countless  Narachas,  Darimukha 
is  lying  in  a  pit  and  the  exceedingly  valiant  Kumuda  died 
shrieking,  under  a  hail  of  missiles.  Angada,  assailed  on  all 
sides  by  titans,  pierced  by  innumerable  shafts,  vomiting  blood, 
fell  on  the  earth  and  the  monkeys  themselves  were  crushed  by 
elephants  and  mowed  down  like  clouds  before  the  wind. 

"  The  enemy  fled  in  terror  under  the  blows  of  the  titans,  who 
followed  on  their  heels  like  lions  pursuing  great  elephants. 
Some  flung  themselves  into  the  sea,  others  took  refuge  in  the 
sky ;  the  bears  with  the  monkeys  climbed  the  trees  whilst  the 
titans  of  fierce  glance  brought  about  a  great  carnage  amongst 
the  Pingalas  in  the  midst  of  the  rocks  and  woods  on  the  shores 
of  the  ocean.  It  was  thus  that  thy  consort  perished  with  his 
forces !  Here  is  his  head,  which  was  gathered  up,  dripping 
with  blood  and  besmeared  with  dust !  " 

Thereafter  that  abominable  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans, 
said  to  the  titan  women  in  the  hearing  of  Sita  : — 

"Bring  hither  Vidyujjihva  of  cruel  deeds,  who  himself 
brought  back  Raghava's  head  from  the  field !  " 

Then  Vidyujjihva,  holding  the  head  and  the  bow,  bowed 
before  Ravana,  whereupon  the  King  said  to  that  Titan 
Vidyujjihva  of  the  long  tongue,  who  stood  before  him  :— 

"  Let  Sita  speedily  behold  the  head  of  Dasaratha's  son  so  that 
she  may  see  clearly  the  sad  end  of  her  lord.  " 

On  this  command,  the  titan  threw  the  cherished  head  at 
Sita's  feet  and  immediately  went  away.  Ravana,  however, 
brandishing  that  great  and  brilliant  bow,  cried  out : — 

"  Here  is  Rama's  bow  famed  in  the  Three  Worlds  !  This  is 
the  bow  with  its  cord  stretched  belonging  to  Rama  that  Prahasta 
77 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

brought  back  from  the  field  after  he  had  slain  that  hero  in  the 
night ! " 

Speaking  thus,  he  cast  the  bow  on  the  ground  near  the  head, 
which  had  been  thrown  down  by  Vidyujjihva,  and  thereafter  he 
addressed  that  illustrious  daughter  of  the  King  of  Videha, 
saying : — 

"  Now  submit  thyself  to  my  desire !  " 


chapter   32 

Sita*s  Despair 

Beholding  that  head  and  the  marvellous  bow  and  remembering 
the  alliance  with  Sugriva  of  which  Hanuman  had  spoken ;  seeing 
those  eyes  and  the  hue  of  the  countenance  resembling  that  of 
her  lord  and  the  locks  at  the  fringe  of  which  a  jewel  shone  on 
the  brow,  all  those  signs  that  convinced  her  of  her  misfortune, 
that  wretched  woman  began  to  inveigh  against  Kaikeyi  and 
cry  out  like  an  osprey,  exclaiming  : — 

"  Rest  content,  O  Kaikeyi !  He,  who  was  the  delight  of  his 
House  is  dead  and,  through  thee,  the  entire  race  has  perished, 
O  Sower  of  Discord !  What  had  the  noble  Rama  ever  done  to 
Kaikeyi  that  she  should  have  presented  him  with  a  robe  of  bark 
and  sent  him  to  the  forest  ?  " 

Speaking  thus,  Vaidehi  began  to  tremble  and  that  young 
ascetic  fell  to  the  ground  like  a  plantain  cut  to  the  roots.  After 
a  time  the  youthful  large-eyed  woman,  regaining  her  breath 
and  consciousness,  approached  the  head  and  gave  herself  up 
to  lamentation,  crying  : — 

"  Alas  !  I  am  undone  !  O  Great-armed  Warrior,  faithful  to 
thine  heroic  vow,  bereft  of  thee,  I  have  fallen  into  the  lowest 
depth  of  calamity.  It  is  said  that  for  a  woman,  the  death  of  her 
husband  is  the  greatest  of  misfortunes  !  Virtuous  consort  of  a 
faithful  companion,  thou  hast  preceded  me  in  death !  I  have 
fallen  into  the  last  extremity  and  am  swallowed  up  in  an  ocean 
of  grief,  since  thou  hast  been  struck  down,  thou  who  else  had 
risen  to  deliver  me!  My  mother-in-law,  Kaushalya,  who 
78 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

cherished  thee  tenderly,  thou,  her  son  Raghava,  now  resembles 
a  cow  that  has  lost  its  calf.  Those  who  boast  that  they  can 
foretell  the  future  prophesied  a  long  life  for  thee ;  false  were 
their  words,  for  thou  hast  barely  lived,  O  Rama,  or  does  prudence 
perchance  sometimes  desert  those  who  are  usually  prudent  as  thou 
wert,  for  time,  the  master  of  all  beings  brings  all  to  maturity  ? 
How  has  death  been  able  to  steal  upon  thee  unawares,  O  Thou, 
versed  in  the  law  of  polity  and  the  science  of  expediency,  who 
wert  so  skilled  in  warding  off  evil  ?  For  having  clasped  me  in 
thine  arms,  that  cruel  and  inhuman  night  of  death  has  robbed 
thee  of  existence  by  force,  O  Lotus-eyed  One.  Here  art  thou, 
lying  on  the  ground,  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  having  deserted 
me  for  the  earth,  thy  more  cherished  love,  O  Lion  among  Men  ! 
O  Hero,  here  lies  thy  golden  bow  so  dear  to  me,  which  I 
anointed  with  perfumes  and  decorated  with  garlands !  Thou 
art  now  re-united  in  heaven  with  thy  Sire  Dasaratha,  my 
father-in-law  and  all  thine  ancestors,  O  Irreproachable 
Prince! 

"  Thou  dost  disdain  to  rejoin  the  saintly  race  of  Rajarishis,  who 
through  the  merit  of  their  virtuous  conduct  have  taken  their 
places  amongst  the  constellations.  Why  dost  thou  not  look  on 
me,  O  King  ?  Why  dost  thou  not  speak  to  me,  I,  thy  spouse, 
who  joined  my  youth  to  thine  ?  Dost  thou  not  recall  the  promise 
made  to  me  when,  taking  my  hand  in  thine,  thou  didst  say  *  I 
shall  be  thy  companion  ? '  O  Kakutstha,  take  me  with  thee, 
wretched  as  I  am! 

"  Why,  leaving  this  world  for  the  other  hast  thou  abandoned 
me  in  mine  affliction,  O  Thou,  the  wisest  of  Sages  ?  Wild 
beasts  are  tearing  that  beautiful  body,  now  a  corpse,  which  was 
formerly  perfumed  by  my  hands  with  divine  essences.  Having 
performed  the  Agnihotra  and  other  sacrifices,  accompanied 
by  the  bestowal  of  splendid  gifts  in  charity,  how  is  it  that 
thou  art  not  honoured  by  the  performance  of  that  same 
ceremony  ? 

Kaushalya,  a  prey  to  grief  will  see  Lakshmana  alone  return 
of  the  three  who  went  into  exile  On  her  enquiry  he  will  inform 
her  of  the  destruction  of  thine  allies  and  how  thou  wert  slain 
while  asleep,  whilst  I  was  taken  into  the  abode  of  the  titans, 
whereupon  her  heart  will  break ;  Kaushalya  will  not  survive,

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

O  Ragbava  !  Miserable  creature  that  I  am,  it  is  on  my  account 
that  the  irreproachable  Rama  who  is  full  of  valour,  having 
crossed  the  ocean  has  perished  in  the  footprint  of  a  cow.  It 
was  in  an  ill-judged  moment  that  the  son  of  Dasaratha  wedded 
me,  I,  the  obloquy  of  my  race,  for  thus  did  the  illustrious  Rama 
wed  death.  Without  doubt  in  a  previous  existence  I  refused  a 
rare  gift,1 1  who  to-day  weep  for  my  lord,  who  here  was  dear  to 
all. 

"  O  Ravana,  unite  the  wife  with  the  husband  and,  without 
delay,  let  me  die  near  Rama.  Join  my  head  with  his  head  and 
my  body  with  his  body  ;  O  Ravana,  let  me  follow  in  the  path 
of  my  magnanimous  lord !  " 

Thus  in  her  burning  grief  did  that  large-eyed  princess,  born 
of  Janaka,  lament  on  seeing  the  head  and  bow  of  her  lord  and, 
as  Sita  was  thus  bewailing,  a  titan,  who  was  standing  guard  at 
the  gate,  ran  to  his  master  with  joined  palms,  crying : — 

"  Mayest  thou  be  victorious,  O  Noble  Lord ! "  thereafter, 
approaching,  he  informed  him  of  the  arrival  of  Prahasta,  the 
leader  of  the  army,  saying  : — 

"  Prahasta,  accompanied  by  all  the  ministers,  has  come  hither 
to  find  thee !  O  Mighty  Monarch,  thou  whom  the  burden  of 
royalty  has  rendered  forbearing,  accord  him  audience  for  some 
urgent  decision  must  be  taken  !  " 

Hearing  these  words  of  the  titan,  Dashagriva  left  the  Ashoka 
Grove  and  went  to  join  his  counsellors.  Then,  having  deliber- 
ated with  them  as  to  what  action  to  pursue,  he  entered  the  council 
chamber  and  issued  his  commands  in  accordance  with  the 
knowledge  he  possessed  of  Rama's  forces. 

Meanwhile  the  instant  Ravana  had  departed,  the  illusory 
head  and  bow  vanished. 

Then  the  King  of  the  Titans,  in  consultation  with  his  highly 
powerful  ministers,  decided  on  the  measures  he  would  adopt 
against  Rama.  All  the  generals  devoted  to  his  interests  stood 
near  and  Ravana  the  Lord  of  the  Titans  resembled  Death  the 
Destroyer  while  he  addressed  them,  saying : 

"  With  the  beating  of  drums,  summon  all  the  forces  without 
further  explanation ! "

"  So  be  it !  "  they  answered  obedient  to  his  commands  and 
instantly  gathered  the  vast  army  together  and,  when  they  were 
all  assembled,  informed  the  king  who  was  burning  to  fight. 


chapter   3  3 

Sarama  consoles  Sita 

Seeing  Sita  in  distress,  that  dear  Vaidehi  whom  she  loved  so 
tenderly,  a  female  titan  named  Sarama  approached  her  and,  with 
gentle  words,  sought  to  console  her,  overwhelmed  as  she  was 
with  the  grief  and  anguish  into  which  that  Indra  among  the 
titans  had  plunged  her. 

The  affectionate  Sarama,  beholding  Sita  distraught,  resembling 
a  mare,  who  having  rolled  in  the  dust  has  just  risen,  reassured 
her  and,  in  her  deep  devotion  for  that  virtuous  princess,  said 
to  her : — 

"  That  which  Ravana  uttered  and  what  thou  thyself  didst 
reply  was  overheard  by  me  as  I  stood  concealed  in  the  solitary 
grove,  for  where  thou  art  the  cause,  I  have  no  fear  of  Ravana, 
O  Lady  of  Large  Eyes  !  And  I  have  also  learnt,  through  my 
perspicacity,  why  that  Lord  of  the  Titans  has  gone  hence  in 
fear,  O  Maithili. 

"  It  is  not  possible  to  take  the  prudent  Rama  by  surprise 
during  sleep  nor  can  one  slay  the  foremost  of  those  conversant 
with  the  Self  nor  is  it  possible  to  wipe  out  the  monkeys  who  fight 
with  trees  and  who  are  under  Rama's  protection  like  the  Gods 
under  the  King  of  the  Celestials.  With  his  long  rounded  arms, 
that  broad-chested  powerful  archer,  full  of  fire,  clad  in  mail, 
who  is  essentially  virtuous  and  renowned  in  the  world,  has,  with 
the  support  of  his  brother  Lakshmana,  ever  known  how  to  defend 
himself  and  others ;  he,  that  illustrious  warrior  versed  in  the 
science  of  politics  and  warfare,  the  exterminator  of  hostile 
battalions,  of  inconceivable  courage,  nay  that  fortunate  Raghava, 
the  scourge  of  his  foes,  has  not  perished,  0  Sita. 

"  Perverse  in  thought  and  action,  that  tyrant  who  oppresses 
all  beings,  made  use  of  magic  to  deceive  thee.  Banish  thy 
8i 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

grief,  great  happiness  awaits  thee !  Assuredly  thou  art  beloved 
of  Lakshmi ;  now  hear  some  pleasant  tidings,  O  Blessed  One ! 

"  Having  crossed  the  ocean  with  his  army  of  monkeys,  Rama 
has  come  to  the  southern  shore  where  he  has  encamped.  I 
perceive  that  Kakutstha,  who  is  accompanied  by  Lakshmana, 
has  fully  attained  his  purpose,  he  is  secure  in  the  midst  of 
innumerable  allies  who  have  halted  on  the  shores  of  the 
sea. 

"  Zealous  titans  sent  out  to  reconnoitre  by  Ravana  have 
brought  him  news  of  Raghava's  crossing  the  ocean.  Learning 
of  this,  O  Large-eyed  Princess,  he  held  a  council  of  his  ministers." 

While  Sarama,  the  titan  woman,  was  conversing  thus  with 
Sita,  a  terrifying  clamour  issuing  from  the  full-throated  titans 
came  to  her  ears  and  a  great  din  of  gongs  struck  with  sticks 
could  be  heard.  Thereupon  the  gentle-speaking  Sarama  said 
to  Sita : — 

"  Listen  to  that  formidable  clang  of  gongs  struck  with  sticks 
which  resembles  thunder.  Intoxicated  elephants  are  saddled 
and  steeds  harnessed  to  chariots ;  hosts  of  combatants  are  to  be 
seen  with  darts  in  their  hands  mounted  on  their  horses,  fully 
equipped,  rushing  hither  and  thither  in  their  thousands.  The 
royal  highways  are  choked  with  soldiers  wonderful  to  behold, 
leaping  and  roaring  like  the  waves  of  the  sea.  Glittering 
armour,  breast-plates,  shields,  chariots,  horses  and  elephants 
belonging  to  the  titans  full  of  fire  and  courage,  surging  forward, 
follow  in  the  wake  of  their  king.  See  how  they  send  forth  shafts 
of  light  of  every  hue.  That  multitude  of  titans  indicates  that  a 
terrible  calamity  is  about  to  descend  on  them  causing  the  hair 
to  stand  on  end. 

"  Rama,  thy  consort,  whose  eyes  resemble  lotus  petals,  like 
unto  Vasava  the  Vanquisher  of  the  Daityas,  will  win  thee  back 
by  slaying  Ravana  in  combat  by  his  unimaginable  prowess, 
whereupon,  his  anger  appeased,  he  will  take  thee  away.  Thy 
lord  with  Lakshmana  will  fall  on  the  titans  as  Vasava  with 
Vishnu  on  his  enemies  the  Daityas.  I  shall  soon  see  thee  in  the 
lap  of  Rama  who  has  come  hither,  all  thy  desires  fulfilled  and 
the  tyrant  fallen.  Tears  of  joy  will  fall  from  thine  eyes,  O 
Janaki,  when  thy  lord,  re-united  with  thee,  will  hold  thee 
clasped  to  his  breast.  Ere  long,  O  Divine  Sita,  that  mighty 
82 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Rama  will  loosen  the  plait  that  hangs  down  thy  back  which  thou 
hast  worn  these  many  months. 

"  Beholding  his  radiant  countenance  resembling  the  full 
moon,  O  Queen,  thou  wilt  renounce  thy  tears,  born  of  grief,  as 
the  female  snake  casts  off  its  slough. 

"  Having  destroyed  Ravana  in  combat,  he  will  assuredly  not 
delay  in  rejoicing  thee,  O  Maithili,  thou,  his  beloved,  so  that  he 
may  enjoy  the  felicity  he  merits.  Embraced  by  the  magnani- 
mous Rama,  thou  shalt  be  happy,  even  as  the  open  field  bringing 
forth  a  harvest  under  plenteous  showers.  Do  thou  now  seek 
refuge  with  him,  O  Queen,  that  sun,  thine  haven,  which  spreads 
from  here  to  the  highest  of  mountains,  like  a  steed  that  courses 
rapidly  in  its  path,  he  is  the  Lord  of  all  beings  !  "

Sita,  who  had  been  overwhelmed  with  misery  on  hearing 
Ravana's  words,  was  comforted  and  rendered  happy  by  Sarama, 
as  the  parched  earth  by  rain.  Desiring  to  be  of  further  service 
to  her  friend,  the  affectionate  female  titan,  skilled  in  the  know- 
ledge of  time  and  place,  smiling,  began  to  speak  in  apposite 
terms,  saying : — 

"  O  Dark-eyed  Lady,  I  am  able  to  carry  a  message  of  goodwill 
from  thee  to  Rama  and  return  secretly,  for  when  I  am  journeying 
in  the  sky,  that  is  extended  without  support,  not  even  Pavana  or 
Garuda  can  follow  in  my  wake." 

Thus  spoke  Sarama,  and  Sita,  her  voice  no  longer  charged 
with  grief,  answered  in  gentle  and  caressing  tones,  saying : — 

"  Thou  art  capable  of  ascending  to  heaven  itself  or  descending 
into  the  nethermost  regions.  Learn  what  is  best  for  thee  to  do, 
if  thine  intention  is  to  please  me  and  thy  resolve  is  fixed.  I 
wish  to  know  what  Ravana  is  doing  now.  That  powerful 
magician,  the  ruthless  Ravana,  a  real  Ravana1  to  his  foes,  has 
bemused  me  with  his  wickedness  as  wine  recently  imbibed ; 

*  Ravana — One  who  causes  others  to  roar  or  cry  out,

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

he  threatens  me  continually  and  insults  me  unceasingly  while 
titans  of  frightful  aspect  surround  me ;  I  am  a  prey  to  terror  and 
my  spirit  is  uneasy.  He  causes  me  to  tremble  with  fear  in  this 
Ashoka  Grove  where  I  am  confined.  If  in  the  assembly  there 
be  any  talk  of  delivering  me  or  keeping  me  captive,  then  com- 
municate the  decision  taken  to  me  and  thou  wilt  render  me  a 
great  service." 

Thus  spoke  Sita  and  Sarama  answered  in  gentle  tones,  wiping 
the  tears  from  her  face  the  while : — 

"  If  this  be  thy  wish,  I  will  go  at  once  and  when  I  have 
discovered  his  design,  I  will  return,  O  Maithili,  O  Daughter  of 
Janaka ! " 

With  these  words  she  returned  to  where  Ravana  was  to  hear 
what  decision  he  had  taken  with  his  ministers. 

Having  listened  secretly  and  learnt  of  the  plans  that  perverse 
wretch  had  made,  she  returned  to  the  enchanting  Ashoka  Grove. 
On  entering  there,  she  beheld  the  daughter  of  Janaka  waiting 
for  her,  like  unto  Lakshmi  bereft  of  her  lotus. 

Thereupon  Sita  ardently  embraced  Sarama  who  had  returned 
and  addressed  her  in  friendly  tones,  offering  her  hei  own  seat, 
saying : — 

"  Rest  at  ease  and  tell  me  exactly  all  that  the  ruthless  Ravana 
of  perverse  soul  has  resolved  to  do." 

Then  Sarama  described  the  whole  interview  of  Ravana  with 
his  ministers  to  the  trembling  Sita,  saying : — 

"  The  mother  of  the  King  of  the  Titans,  through  an  aged 
counsellor,  who  is  devoted  to  her,  insisted  again  and  again  that 
they  should  let  Vaidehi  go,  saying : — 

"  'Let  them  return  Maithili  honourably  to  that  King  of  Men  1 
His  astonishing  exploits  in  Janasthana  should  be  a  lesson  to 
thee ;  what  mortal  could  have  accomplished  the  crossing  of  the 
ocean,  the  discovery  of  Sita  by  Hanuman  and  the  carnage  of 
the  titans  in  combat  ?  * 

"  Thus  did  the  elderly  minister  and  his  mother  exhort  him 
but  be  is  no  more  capable  of  giving  up  his  treasure  than  a  miser 
his  gold.  He  will  never  set  thee  free  unless  he  is  slain  in  combat, 
O  Maithili ;  such  is  the  resolve  of  that  wicked  wretch  made  with 
his  counsellors ;  impelled  by  death  his  determination  is  fixed. 
Fear  will  never  cause  Ravana  to  let  thee  go ;  nor  will  he  do  so 

84 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

till  he  is  struck  down  by  weapons  or  all  the  titans  and  he  himself 
have  succumbed.  When  he  has  destroyed  Ravana  with  bis  sharp 
arrows  in  combat,  Rama  will  take  thee  back  to  Ayodhya,  O 
Dark-eyed  Lady ! " 

At  that  moment  the  cheering  of  the  whole  army  blended 
with  the  roll  of  drums  and  the  blare  of  trumpets  arose  and  the 
earth  shook.  That  tumult  raised  by  the  monkey  forces  was 
heard  by  the  adherents  of  the  King  of  the  Titans,  who  were 
assembled  in  Lanka,  and  their  spirits  fell.  Seeing  no  hope  on 
account  of  their  sovereign's  offence  they  were  plunged  in 
despondency. 


CHAPTER    3  5 

Malyavan  advises  Ravana  to  make  peace 

It  was  to  the  beating  of  gongs  and  the  blare  of  trumpets  that 
the  long-armed  Rama,  the  conqueror  of  hostile  cities,  approached 
Lanka  and,  on  hearing  this  tumult,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans 
paused  a  moment  to  reflect  and  then  addressed  his  ministers. 

The  mighty  Ravana,  in  a  voice  that  resounded  through  the 
hall,  began  to  decry  Rama,  bis  valour,  the  strength  of  bis  arms 
and  his  crossing  of  the  ocean,  saying : — 

"  I  have  heard  all  that  is  reported  of  Rama  ;  I  know  too  of 
your  courage  in  the  field,  yet,  on  beholding  that  valiant  warrior, 
you  now  look  on  each  other  in  silence !  " 

Thereupon  hearing  the  words  of  Ravana,  whose  maternal 
grandfather  he  was,  the  highly  intelligent  Titan  Malyavan 
answered  him  thus  : — 

"  O  King,  that  monarch  who  is  versed  in  the  fourteen  sciences, 
who  follows  polity,  rules  an  empire  over  a  long  period  and 
overcomes  his  adversaries,  who  concludes  peace  or  wages 
war  at  a  fitting  time,  advances  his  own  party  and  attains 
great  power.  A  monarch  should  ally  himself  to  one  stronger 
than  himself  or  to  an  equal ;  he  should  never  underrate  a  foe  and 
if  he  is  more  powerful,  should  make  war  on  him.  On  this 
account  X  counsel  an  alliance  with  Rama  and  the  return  of  Sita 

o  85 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

who  is  the  actual  cause  of  the  dispute.  Devas,  Rishis,  Gand- 
harvas,  all  desire  him  to  triumph ;  do  not  wage  war  but  resolve 
to  make  peace  with  him ! 

"  The  blessed  Grandsire  created  two  paths  that  rest  either  on 
righteousness  or  unrighteousness,  the  path  of  the  Gods  and  the 
path  of  the  titans.  Righteousness  is  the  path  of  the  magnani- 
mous Immortals  and  unrighteousness  that  of  the  demons  and 
titans.  When  virtue  consumed  evil,  it  was  the  Krita  Age  and 
when  wrong-doing  swallowed  up  virtue,  the  Tishya  planet  was 
in  the  ascendant  and  thou,  adopting  unrighteousness,  didst 
range  the  worlds  destroying  virtue ;  it  is  on  account  of  this  that 
thy  foes  have  waxed  powerful !  The  serpent  of  evil,  nourished 
by  thy  folly,  is  now  consuming  us,  while  those  allied  with  the 
Gods  are  fortified  by  their  practice  of  virtue.  A  slave  of  the 
senses,  all  that  thou  undertakest  excites  the  wrath  of  the 
ascetics,  those  personifications  of  the  Fire-God  whose  power 
is  as  irresistible  as  the  glowing  flames.  They  purify  their  souls 
through  austerities  and  find  satisfaction  in  the  performance  of 
their  duty.  In  truth,  those  Twice-born  offer  innumerable  and 
excellent  sacrifices,  kindling  the  sacred  fire  in  accordance  with 
prescribed  rituals ;  they  recite  the  Vedas  in  a  loud  voice  and 
utter  sacred  texts  while  subduing  the  titans.  Scattered  in  all 
directions,  like  the  stormy  waves  during  the  hot  season,  the 
smoke,  arising  from  the  Agnihotra  performed  by  those  Rishis, 
the  equals  of  Agni,  spreads  over  the  ten  cardinal  points  and 
diminishes  the  titans'  energy.  In  the  various  regions  sanctified 
by  their  religious  observances,  the  burning  austerity  of  those 
ascetics  torments  the  titans. 

"  Thou  hast  received  the  boon  of  invincibility  from  Devas, 
Danavas  and  Yakshas  but  these  are  men,  bears  and  powerful 
Golangulas  who,  full  of  energy  and  prowess,  are  coming  hither 
roaring  like  lions.  Beholding  these  sinister  and  formidable 
portents  of  every  kind,  I  foresee  the  total  extermination  of  the 
titans.  With  a  terrifying  clamour,  monstrous  clouds,  inspiring 
horror,  rain  hot  blood  on  Lanka  on  every  side.  Those  beasts 
drawing  the  chariots  are  shedding  tears.  Discoloured  with 
dust,  the  four  quarters  no  longer  shine ;  serpents,  jackals  and 
vultures  are  invading  Lanka,  gathering  in  the  public  squares 
with  frightful  cries ;  standing  before  us  in  dream,  coal  black 
86 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

women  with  white  teeth  resembling  Kali  burst  into  loud 
laughter,  pillaging  the  dwellings  and  chattering  incoherently ; 
in  the  houses,  dogs  devour  the  sacred  offerings  and  donkeys  are 
born  of  cows,  rats  of  mongoose ;  cats  mate  with  tigers,  pigs 
with  dogs  and  Kinneras  with  demons  and  men.  Red-footed 
and  white  pigeons,  messengers  of  death,  by  their  flight  foretell 
the  extermination  of  the  titans ;  domesticated  parrots,  falling 
under  the  attack  of  other  birds,  call  *  Chichikuchi ' !  Birds  and 
wild  beasts,  their  eyes  fixed  on  the  sun,  cry  out !  Death  in  the 
shape  of  a  human  monster,  deformed,  bald  and  tawny-coloured, 
visits  the  dwellings  in  turn.  These  and  other  omens  equally 
sinister  appear.  Raghava  of  fixed  prowess  is,  Z  deem,  Vishnu 
in  human  form ;  he  is  undoubtedly  no  mere  man ;  he  who  built 
a  bridge  over  the  deep  is  an  exceedingly  wonderful  being  ! 
Therefore,  O  Ravana,  for  thine  own  good,  conclude  peace  with 
Rama  who  is  the  king  of  men." 

Having  spoken  thus,  Malyavan,  the  bravest  of  warriors,  aware 
of  what  was  passing  in  Ravana's  mind,  eyeing  him,  became 
silent. 


chapter   36 

Ravana  directs  Lanka's  Defences 

Dashanana1  could  not  brook  Malyavan's  salutory  utterances 
and,  scowling,  a  prey  to  anger,  tolling  his  eyes  in  fury,  answered 
him  thus : — 

"  I  have  closed  mine  ears  to  the  speech  thou  hast  made, 
albeit  with  good  intentions ;  how  canst  thou  hold  a  mere  man 
like  Rama,  who  is  single-handed,  without  any  support  but 
that  of  the  deer  of  the  trees,  cast  off  by  his  sire  and  exiled  to  the 
forest,  to  be  of  my  stature,  I,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  the  terror 
of  the  Gods  ?  Dost  thou  then  consider  me  to,  be  destitute  of 
power? 

"  I  am  at  a  loss  to  determine  if  it  be  envy  of  my  prowess  or 
predelietion  for  the  foe  that  has  brought  thee  to  address  such 

1  Ten-faced  One. 

87 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

hard  words  to  me,  unless  it  be  that  thou  desirest  to  spur  me  on  ! 
In  truth,  what  man  learned  in  the  science  of  the  Shastras  would 
speak  thus  harshly  to  a  seasoned  warrior,  were  it  not  to  incite 
him? 

"  Having  borne  Sita  away  from  the  forest,  she  who  resembles 
Shri  bereft  of  her  lotus,  why,  through  fear,  should  I  return  her 
to  Raghava  ?  Thou  shalt  see  him  fall  under  my  blows  in  the 
midst  of  the  innumerable  monkeys  who  surround  him.  How 
should  Ravana,  whom  the  Deities  themselves  dare  not  meet  in 
single  combat,  experience  fear  in  this  encounter?  Rather 
would  I  be  cut  in  twain  than  bend  before  any !  Such  was  I 
from  birth,  it  is  my  nature  and  unalterable  !  Even  if  Rama  by 
some  happy  chance  has  been  able  to  throw  a  bridge  over  the  sea, 
what  great  marvel  is  there  in  that,  that  thou  shouldst  give  way 
to  terror  ?  It  is  true  he  has  crossed  the  ocean  with  an  army  of 
monkeys  but  I  swear  to  thee  he  will  not  return  alive." 

Beholding  Ravana  to  be  highly  provoked  and  speaking  with 
such  fury,  Malyavan,  abashed,  did  not  reply  and  duly  invoking 
his  success  as  courtesy  demanded,  he  begged  permission  to 
retire. 

Meanwhile  Ravana,  assisted  by  his  ministers,  having  deliber- 
ated on  what  ought  to  be  done,  set  about  planning  the  defence 
of  Lanka. 

Thereafter  he  gave  over  the  eastern  gate  to  the  Titan  Prahasta 
and  that  of  the  south  to  the  warriors  Mahaparshwa  and 
Mahodara.  At  the  western  gate  he  placed  his  son  Indrajita, 
a  powerful  magician,  with  a  considerable  force  of  titans  and  he 
established  Shuka  and  Sarana  at  the  northern  gate,  saying : — 

"  I  myself  shall  take  up  that  position  also  !  " 

Finally  he  commanded  the  Titan  Virupaksha,  who  was  full  of 
energy  and  courage,  to  occupy  the  centre  of  the  city  with  a  large 
number  of  soldiers. 

Taking  every  precaution  for  the  safety  of  Lanka,  that  bull 
among  the  titans,  under  the  sway  of  destiny,  deemed  his  purpose 
accomplished.  Having  made  provision  for  the  defence  of  the 
city,  he  dismissed  his  ministers  and  received  the  acclamations 
of  the  assembly,  after  which  he  entered  his  sumptuous  inner 
apartments.

CHAPTER    37 

Rama  makes  his  Plans  for  the  Attack 

Meanwhile  that  King  of  Men,  the  Sovereign  of  the  Monkeys, 
the  Son  of  the  Wind,  Jambavan  the  King  of  the  Bears,  the  Titan 
Bibishana  with  Bali's  son  Angada  and  Saumitri,  the  Ape 
Sharabha,  also  Sushena  and  his  kinsfolk  Mainda  and  Dvivida, 
Gaja,  Gavaksha,  Kumuda,  Nala  and  Panasa,  all  having  reached 
the  enemy's  territory,  assembled  to  take  counsel  together. 

They  said  : — "  Yonder  under  our  very  eyes  is  the  City  of  Lanka 
defended  by  Ravana,  impregnable  even  to  the  Gods  and  Asuras 
together  or  the  Uragas  and  Gandharvas.  Let  us  take  counsel 
as  to  what  means  to  adopt  that  will  ensure  the  success  of  our 
expedition  in  order  to  penetrate  into  the  eternal  retreat  of 
Ravana,  the  King  of  the  Titans.'* 

At  this,  the  younger  brother  of  Ravana,  Bibishana,  uttered 
these  words  that  were  both  just  and  irreproachable : — 

"  Anala,  Panasa,  Sampati  and  Pramati  have  been  to  Lanka 
from  whence  they  have  returned.  Assuming  the  form  of  birds, 
all  four  entered  that  hostile  citadel  and  studied  the  measures 
taken  by  Ravana  closely.  I  will  give  a  detailed  report  as  it  was 
given  to  me  of  the  defences  organized  by  that  perverse  wretch  ; 
O  Rama,  hear  me  ! 

"  At  the  eastern  gate,  Prahasta  is  stationed  with  his  division ; 
at  the  southern  gate  are  the  warriors  Mahaparshwa  and 
Mahodara;  Indrajita  is  at  the  western  gate  where  he  is  in 
command  of  a  considerable  force  armed  with  harpoons,  swords, 
bows,  spears  and  hammers.  Ravana's  son  has  thousands  of 
warriors  under  his  command,  holding  lances  in  their  hands, 
furnished  with  weapons  of  every  kind. 

"  Apprehensive,  a  prey  to  great  anxiety,  Ravana,  versed  in  the 
sacred  formulas,  is  himself  stationed  with  the  titans  at  the 
northern  gate.  As  for  Virupaksha,  he,  with  a  strong  detachment 
armed  with  spears,  clubs  and  bows  occupies  the  centre  of  the 
city. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Having  seen  these  hosts  thus  distributed,  my  spies  have  set 
out  in  all  haste  and  returned  again.  The  elephants  number 
some  ten  thousand,  the  cavalry  twenty  thousand  and  there  are 
more  than  a  million  foot  soldiers.  Hardy  and  vigorous,  these 
intrepid  warriors  have  ever  been  their  sovereign's  favourites; 
each  of  the  titan  generals,  when  on  campaign,  commands  a 
million  soldiers,  O  Lord  of  Men." 

Having  conveyed  this  information  concerning  the  city,  the 
mighty  Bibishana  brought  his  envoys  before  Rama  and  those 
titans  confirmed  all  that  was  known  regarding  Lanka.  Thereafter 
the  younger  brother  of  Havana,  in  his  desire  to  please  Raghava, 
addressed  that  Lotus-eyed  One  further,  saying  : — 

"  O  Rama,  when  Ravana  made  war  on  Kuvera,  seven  million 
soldiers  accompanied  him.  For  vigour,  daring,  energy,  extreme 
power  of  endurance  and  pride,  they  equalled  their  wicked  king. 
There  is  no  question  here  of  my  wishing  to  agitate  thee  by  what 
I  have  said  but  a  desire  to  rouse  thine  indignation,  not  thy  fears, 
for  in  knightly  valour,  thou  art  equal  to  the  Gods  themselves. 
Having  set  out  these  monkey  forces  in  battle  airay,  thou  shalt 
destroy  Ravana  with  thy  great  army  composed  of  four  angas1 
which  surround  thee." 

Bibishana  having  spoken  thus,  Raghava  gave  his  orders  for 
the  attack,  saying  : — 

"  At  the  eastern  gate,  Nila,  that  lion  among  monkeys,  should 
oppose  Prahasta  with  his  innumerable  infantry  and  let  Bali's 
son,  Angada,  at  the  head  of  a  strong  division,  drive  away 
Mahaparshwa  and  Mahodara  from  the  southern  gate ;  that  son 
of  the  Wind,  whose  valour  is  immeasurable,  will  penetrate  into 
the  city  with  his  great  forces. 

"  I  reserve  the  right  to  slay  the  wicked  King  of  the  Titans, 
who  owing  to  the  boon  he  has  received  enjoys  oppressing  the 
Daityas  and  Danavas  as  also  the  magnanimous  Rishis  and  who 
ranges  the  worlds  persecuting  all  beings.  With  the  aid  of 
Saumitri  I  shall  force  an  entry  through  the  northern  gate  and 
follow  in  the  wake  of  Ravana  and  his  army.  Let  the  mighty 
Indra  among  Monkeys,  the  valiant  King  of  the  Bears  and  the 
younger  brother  of  the  Lord  of  the  Titans  occupy  the  central 
position.

"  The  monkeys  should  not  assume  human  form  in  the  fray 
for,  when  we  are  fighting  in  the  ranks,  the  monkey  shape  should 
serve  as  a  sign  of  recognition  amongst  us.  Seven  will  attack 
the  foe  in  human  form,  I,  my  brother  Lakshmana,  who  is  full 
of  valour,  my  friend  Bibishana  and  his  four  companions." 

Having  said  this  to  Bibishana  for  the  success  of  the  enterprise, 
Rama,  in  the  role  of  a  wise  leader,  decided  to  stay  on  Mount 
Suvela  whose  ravishing  slopes  he  had  observed. 

Thereafter  at  the  head  of  his  great  army  which  spread  over 
the  earth,  the  magnanimous  Rama  set  out  for  Lanka  with  a 
joyous  and  exultant  air,  resolved  to  destroy  his  enemy. 


chapter  3  8 

The    Ascent    of    Mount    Suvela 

Having  resolved  to  stay  on  Mount  Suvela,  Rama,  followed  by 
Lakshmana,  addressed  Sugriva  and  also  Bibishana  the  night- 
ranger,  who  was  full  of  integrity,  devotion,  sagacity  and 
experience  and,  in  tones  of  great  sweetness  and  nobility,  said  : — 

"  Let  us  ascend  the  Mount  Suvela,  that  king  of  peaks  and 
plateaus,  filled  with  hundreds  of  metallic  veins,  in  order  to  pass 
the  night  there.  Then  we  shall  be  able  to  survey  Lanka,  the 
haunt  of  that  titan,  that  wretch  who  has  borne  away  my  consort 
to  his  own  destruction !  He  has  neither  regard  for  justice, 
virtue  nor  the  honour  of  his  House,  he,  who,  in  consequence  of 
his  base  nature,  has  committed  this  heinous  deed." 

Thus  reflecting  and  censuring  Ravana,  Rama  approached 
Mount  Suvela  with  its  ravishing  slopes  and  began  the  ascent. 
Behind  him  came  Lakshmana,  proud  of  his  great  valour,  alert, 
bearing  his  bow  and  arrows  and  Sugriva,  who  with  his  ministers 
and  Bibishana  scaled  the  mountain  also.  Those  rangers  of  the 
hills  bounded  with  the  speed  of  the  wind  scrambling  from  a 
hundred  sides  at  once  in  the  steps  of  Raghava  and  did  not  take 
long  to  reach  the  summit. 

From  there  they  observed  that  splendid  city  with  its  marvellous 
gates  enclosed  in  magnificent  ramparts,  as  if  suspended  in  the 

9i 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

air ;  thus  did  Lanka,  filled  with  warriors,  appear  to  those  monkey 
leaders  and,  standing  on  those  wonderful  ramparts,  the  dark- 
hued  titans  resembled  a  second  wall  in  the  eyes  of  the  foremost 
monkeys.  Beholding  them,  the  monkeys,  in  Rama's  presence, 
burning  to  fight,  redoubled  their  cries. 

Meanwhile  the  sun,  dyed  with  the  fires  of  dusk,  moved 
towards  the  west,  and  the  night,  illumined  by  the  full  moon, 
drew  on.  Then  Rama,  the  leader  of  the  monkey  army,  having 
exchanged  salutations  with  Bibishana,  established  himself 
happily  on  the  breast  of  Mount  Suvela  with  the  leaders  of  the 
monkeys. 


chapter  39 

Description  of  Lanka 

Having  passed  the  night  on  Mount  Suvela,  the  valiant  monkey 
generals  surveyed  the  woods  and  groves  of  Lanka  and  observing 
them  to  be  so  extensive,  agreeable,  pleasant,  vast  and  wide, 
marvellous  to  behold,  they  were  seized  with  admiration. 

Champakas,  Ashokas,  Bakulas,  Salas  and  Talas  abounded ; 
Tamalas,  Hintalas,  Arjunas,  Nipas,  Saptaparnas  in  full  Mower, 
Nagas,  Tilakas,  Karnikaras  and  Patalas  grew  on  every  side.  The 
trees  with  their  flowering  crests,  round  which  magnificent 
creepers  twined,  gave  Lanka  a  brilliant  appearance  which  she 
owed  also  to  the  borders  planted  with  diverse  flowers  and  red 
and  tender  buds  as  also  innumerable  shady  avenues.  The 
blossom  and  fragrant  fruit  with  which  the  trees  were  laden 
caused  them  to  resemble  men  adorned  with  jewels  or  the  ravish- 
ing Chaitaratha,  the  equal  of  the  Nandana  Gardens,  a  grove 
resplendently  green  in  all  seasons,  filled  with  swarming  bees  and 
sparkling  with  beauty.  Then  the  valiant  monkeys  able  to  change 
their  shape  at  will  penetrated  into  those  groves  frequented  by 
waterfowl  intoxicated  with  love  and  with  honey  bees  where  the 
branches  of  the  trees  were  filled  with  cuckoos  and  resounded  to 
the  notes  of  the  shrike  and  the  cry  of  the  osprey  and,  as  they 
entered  there,  a  breeze  redolent  with  the  scent  of  flowers  blew 
like  a  soft  breath.

Meanwhile  some  of  the  leaders  broke  away  from  the  monkey 
ranks  and,  with  the  permission  of  their  prince,  approached  that 
paved  city.  Terrifying  the  birds,  deer  and  elephants,  they 
shook  Lanka  with  their  roaring,  excelling  as  they  did  in  shouting 
and,  in  their  immense  ardour,  they  trampled  down  the  earth  so 
that  the  dust  rose  in  clouds  under  their  feet. 

Bears,  lions,  buffalo,  wild  elephants,  antelopes  and  birds, 
alarmed  by  the  noise,  spread  over  the  ten  points  of  the  horizon. 

The  Trikuta  Mountain  had  an  exceedingly  lofty  summit 
that  appeared  to  touch  the  skies  ;  it  was  covered  with  blossom, 
sparkling  like  gold,  a  hundred  leagues  in  extent,  stainless, 
graceful  to  behold,  smooth,  inaccessible  in  height  even  to  birds 
and  could  not  be  scaled  even  in  thought,  much  less  in  reality ; 
it  was  on  this  promontory  that  Lanka  was  built  of  which 
Ravana  was  the  highway. 

Ten  leagues  wide,  twenty  in  length,  with  its  tall  gates  which 
resembled  white  clouds  and  its  ramparts  of  gold  and  silver, 
it  was  a  very  marvel !  Palaces  and  temples  were  the  splendid 
decoration  of  that  city,  as  clouds  at  the  end  of  summer  are  to 
the  region  of  Vishnu  that  is  found  between  earth  and  heaven. 

In  Lanka,  a  building  of  a  thousand  pillars  artistically  con- 
structed, resembling  the  peak  of  Kailasha  which  seemed  to  lick 
the  firmament,  was  to  be  seen.  This  was  the  retreat  of  the 
Indra  of  the  Titans  and  the  ornament  of  the  city,  guarded 
constantly  by  a  hundred  titans.  Ravishing  with  its  gold,  the 
mountains  served  as  its  decoration  and  it  was  dazzling  with  its 
rich  parks  and  many  squares  re-echoing  to  the  song  of  birds  of 
every  kind,  frequented  by  deer,  covered  with  various  flowers, 
inhabited  by  titans  of  every  degree,  and  that  opulent  city  of 
immense  resources  resembled  the  celestial  regions. 

Beholding  that  auspicious  capital,  the  valiant  elder  brother  of 
Lakshmana  was  seized  with  astonishment  and  Rama  with  his 
vast  army  contemplated  that  citadel  filled  with  treasure, 
abundantly  provisioned,  garlanded  with  palaces,  exceedingly 
strong,  with  its  powerful  engines  of  war  and  solid  gates.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    40 

The  extraordinary  Combat  between  Sugriva  and  Ravana 

Then  Rama,  accompanied  by  Sugriva  and  his  monkey  leaders, 
ascended  the  summit  of  Mount  Suvela  that  had  a  circumference 
of  two  leagues ;  there  he  halted  awhile,  surveying  the  ten 
cardinal  points  and  his  gaze  fell  on  Lanka  which  was  ravishing 
with  its  enchanting  groves  that  had  been  built  by  Vishvakarma 
on  the  summit  of  the  Trikuta  Mountain. 

There  above  a  gateway  stood  the  invincible  Lord  of  the 
Titans,  white  chanwaras  being  waved  above  him  and  the 
triumphal  parasol  indicating  his  rank.  Anointed  with  red 
sandal-paste,  adorned  with  scarlet  ornaments,  he  was  attired 
in  raiment  embroidered  with  gold  and  resembled  a  dark  cloud. 
The  scars  of  the  wounds,  inflicted  on  him  by  Airavata  with  his 
tusks,  pitted  his  breast,  and  he  was  wrapped  in  a  cloak  of  the 
colour  of  hare's  blood  so  that  he  appeared  like  unto  a  cloud  dyed 
with  the  tints  of  sunset. 

The  Indra  of  the  Monkeys  beheld  him  asRaghava  also  and,  on 
seeing  him,  Sugriva,  gathering  up  his  strength,  in  an  impulse  of 
fury  suddenly  bounded  from  the  summit  of  the  mountain  and 
descended  at  the  gate.  For  a  moment  he  paused,  then  with  a 
fearless  soul  he  eyed  that  titan  whom  be  regarded  as  a  mere 
straw  and  thereafter  addressed  him  harshly,  saying : — 

"  I  am  the  friend  of  the  Protector  of  the  Worlds,  Rama ;  by 
the  grace  of  that  King  of  Kings  thou  shalt  not  escape  me  to-day." 

Speaking  thus  he  suddenly  leapt  upon  him  and,  snatching 
off  his  brilliant  diadem,  threw  it  on  the  earth. 

Seeing  him  about  to  rush  upon  him  again,  that  Ranger  of  the 
Night  said  to  him : — 

"  Sugriva  thou  wert  unknown  to  me,  now  thou  shalt  be 
Hinagriva  I1 " 

Speaking  thus,  he  threw  himself  upon  him  and  with  his  two 
arms  flung  him  to  the  ground.  Bouncing  up  like  a  ball,  that 
monkey  struck  his  adversary  in  his  turn  and  perspiration  broke 

1  Sugriva  meaning  '  handsome-necked  '  and  Hinagriva  '  necklet*  '. 

94 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

out  on  the  limbs  of  both  and  their  bodies  were  red  with  blood ; 
each  clung  to  the  other,  paralysing  his  opponent's  movements 
and  they  resembled  the  Shalmali  and  Kimshuka  Trees. 

Then  followed  blows  and  slaps  with  hands  and  arms  and  an 
indescribable  struggle  arose  between  the  two  powerful  kings, 
the  Lords  of  the  Titans  and  Monkeys.  Hard  and  long  was  the 
combat  between  these  two  doughty  champions  in  the  gateway, 
each  in  turn  lifting  the  other  up,  crouching  and  changing  their 
positions,  tripping  each  other  and  throwing  each  other  down, 
crushing  one  another,  bruising  each  other's  limbs,  and,  falling 
between  the  Sala  Trees  and  the  moat,  they  would  leap  up  again, 
pausing  an  instant  to  regain  their  breath.  Then,  with  arms 
interlaced  like  ropes,  they  remained  locked  together,  struggling 
and  furious,  full  of  skill  and  energy,  moving  to  and  fro.  Like 
a  lion  and  a  tiger  or  two  young  elephants,  that  have  just  grown 
their  tusks,  scrutinising  each  other,  with  arms  interlaced  and 
grappling  with  one  another,  they  fell  on  the  earth  together. 
Thereafter,  rising,  they  hurled  themselves  on  each  other  afresh, 
circling  round  the  arena  again  and  again,  like  skilled  and  mighty 
wrestlers  nor  were  they  easily  fatigued.  Like  unto  great  tuskers, 
with  their  enormous  arms  resembling  the  trunks,  they  gripped 
each  other  tightly.  Circling  round  and  round  in  that  duel 
which  was  long  and  fierce,  they  trampled  down  the  earth  and, 
approaching  each  other,  like  two  wild  cats  fighting  over  a  piece 
of  meat,  each  tried  to  kill  his  adversary.  Taking  up  diverse 
postures,  describing  innumerable  evolutions,  running  like  an 
ox's  urine,  halting,  coming  and  going,  they  executed  a  myriad 
different  movements;  stepping  sideways,  making  feints,  twisting 
to  avoid  a  blow,  turning  about,  darting  to  the  attack,  each 
hurling  himself  on  his  opponent,  standing  firm  and  erect, 
disengaging  themselves,  presenting  back  and  flank,  preparing  to 
leap,  letting  go  or  stealing  away,  thus  Sugriva  and  Ravana,  to 
their  utmost  satisfaction,  multiplied  such  feats  in  which  they 
excelled. 

Meanwhile  the  titan  had  recourse  to  magic  and  when  the 
King  of  the  Monkeys  perceived  it,  he  flew  into  the  sky  triumph- 
ant, shaking  off  all  fatigue  whilst  Ravana,  overcome  with 
exhaustion,  breathing  heavily,  baffled  by  the  King  of  the 
Monkeys,  stood  confounded. 

95 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Thus  the  Lord  of  the  Monkeys,  acquiring  fame  as  a  warrior, 
having  wearied  Ravana  in  combat,  ascended  into  the  infinite 
blue  with  the  swiftness  of  thought,  and  that  offspring  of  the  Sun, 
having  accomplished  this  feat,  delighted,  rejoined  the  army, 
honoured  by  the  monkey  leaders,  thereby  increasing  the  joy 
of  the  foremost  of  the  Raghus. 


CHAPTER    41 

Rama  sends  Angada  to  Ravana 

Seeing  him  bearing  the  marks  of  valour,  the  elder  brother  of 
Lakshmana,  Rama,  embracing  him,  said  to  Sugriva : — 

"  Without  consulting  me  thou  hast  acted  thus  imprudently  ; 
such  rashness  is  not  seemly  in  a  king.  By  thy  recklessness 
thou  hast  caused  me  great  anxiety  as  also  the  army  and  Bibishana! 
O  Warrior,  thou  art  enamoured  of  deeds  of  daring  !  Do  not  act 
thus  in  the  future,  0  Vanquisher  of  thy  Foes  !  If  thou  hadst 
come  by  some  misfortune,  what  would  Sita  or  Bharata  or  my 
younger  brothers,  Lakshmana  or  Shatrughna  have  availed  me  ? 

"  O  Valiant  Scourge  of  Thy  Foes,  if  thou  hadst  not  returned, 
though  I  am  conversant  with  thy  valour,  this  was  my  fixed 
resolve  ;  having  destroyed  Ravana  in  fight  with  his  sons,  forces 
and  chariots,  I  should  have  installed  Bibishana  as  King  of 
Lanka,  suffered  Bharata  to  ascend  the  throne  and  renounced 
my  life,  O  Great  Prince." 

At  these  words  of  Rama,  Sugriva  answered,  saying : — 

"  Seeing  the  one  who  had  borne  away  thy  consort,  O  Brave 
Descendant  of  Raghu,  conscious  of  mine  own  strength,  how 
could  I  have  acted  otherwise  ?  " 

Thus  spoke  that  warrior,  and  Raghava,  having  commended 
him,  addressed  Lakshmana  who  was  endowed  with  auspicious 
marks,  saying : — 

"  Beside  these  cool  waters  and  trees  laden  with  fruit,  let  us 

divide  and  marshal  our  forces,  O  Lakshmana  !    I  foresee  a 

terrible  calamity  boding  universal  destruction  and  death  to  the 

intrepid  bears,  monkeys  and  titans.    Harsh  winds  blow,  the 

96 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

earth  trembles  and  the  mountains  quake ;  trees  crash  to  the 
earth,  sinister  clouds  resembling  birds  of  prey  roar  in  terrifying 
wise  and  let  fall  rain  mixed  with  blood  ;  the  dusk,  red  as  sandal, 
is  full  of  horror  and  from  the  sun,  a  flaming  circle  falls.  Wild 
beasts  and  birds  emit  frantic  cries  and  are  ill  at  ease  ;  their  voices 
and  fierce  aspect  deprive  them  of  their  beauty.  In  the  night, 
the  moon,  shorn  of  its  radiance,  surrounded  by  black  and  fiery 
rays,  burns  red,  as  at  the  time  of  the  destruction  of  the  world. 
A  thin,  dark,  sinister  rim  of  coppery  hue  is  seen  round  the  sun 
and  on  its  surface  a  black  mark  appears  nor  does  that  orb 
approach  any  other  planets  as  is  usual,  all  of  which  prefigures 
the  final  dissolution  of  the  world. 

"  Behold,  O  Lakshmana,  how  crows,  eagles  and  vultures  are 
flying  low,  circulating  rapidly,  emitting  piercing  and  lugubrious 
cries  !  The  earth  changed  to  mud  and  gore  will  be  covered 
with  rocks,  javelins  and  darts  hurled  by  the  monkeys  and  titans  ! 
This  very  day,  surrounded  by  the  monkeys  on  all  sides,  let  us 
mate  an  attack  on  that  citadel  defended  by  Ravana." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Lakshmana,  his  younger  brother,  that 
mighty  warrior  rapidly  descended  from  the  summit  of  the 
mountain  and  coming  to  the  bottom  of  that  hill,  the  virtuous 
Raghava  inspected  his  army  which  was  invincible  to  the  foe. 
Then,  the  time  having  come,  Rama,  who  was  conversant  with  the 
fitting  moment  to  act,  gave  the  signal  to  advance  and,  at  an 
auspicious  moment,  bow  in  hand,  turned  towards  Lanka. 

Bibishana,  Sugriva,  Hanuman,  Nala,  Jambavan  the  King  of 
the  Bears,  as  also  Nila  and  Lakshmana  followed,  and  behind 
them  the  mighty  host  of  bears  and  monkeys,  covering  a  vast 
stretch  of  earth,  threw  themselves  in  Raghava's  wake.  Hundreds 
of  rocks  and  enormous  trees  served  as  weapons  to  those  monkeys, 
verily  the  vanquishers  of  their  foes,  who  resembled  elephants. 

Soon  the  two  brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  those  subduers 
of  the  foe,  reached  the  city  of  Ravana,  garlanded  with  banners, 
enchanting  with  the  pleasure  gardens  which  adorned  it, 
inaccessible  with  its  many  gateways,  high  walls  and  arches. 
Then  those  denizens  of  the  forests,  encouraged  by  the  sound  of 
Rama's  voice  and  obedient  to  his  commands,  halted  before 
Lanka,  which  was  impregnable,  even  to  the  Gods. 

Thereafter  Rama,  accompanied  by  his  younger  brother,  bow 

97 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

in  hand,  surveyed  the  northern  gate,  which  was  as  high  as  the 
peak  of  a  mountain  and  took  up  his  position  there.  That 
valiant  son  of  Dasaratha,  followed  by  Lakshmana,  advanced 
under  the  walls  of  Lanka,  whose  highway  was  Ravana.  None 
but  Rama  could  have  approached  and  examined  the  northern 
gate  where  Ravana  stood,  which  was  formidable  and  guarded  by 
him  as  the  ocean  by  Varuna  and  which  was  defended  on  all 
sides  by  titans,  as  the  Danavas,  who  sow  terror  in  the  hearts  of 
the  weak,  guard  Patala.  And  Rama  observed  innumerable 
weapons  and  armour  of  every  kind  heaped  there  for  the  combat- 
ants. 

Meanwhile  Nila  took  up  his  position  with  Mainda  and 
Dvivida  at  the  eastern  gate  at  the  head  of  a  host  of  monkeys. 

Angada  with  his  vast  forces,  assisted  by  Rishabha,  Gavaksha, 
Ga)a  and  Gavaya,  occupied  the  southern  gate.  Hanuman, 
that  virtuous  monkey,  was  stationed  at  the  western  gate  with 
Prajangha,  Tarasa  and  other  warriors  grouped  round  him, 
whilst  Sugriva,  personally  occupied  an  observation  post  in  the 
centre.  At  the  head  of  all  those  leading  monkeys,  the  equals  of 
Suparna  and  Pavana,  thirty-six  kotis  of  renowned  warriors  were 
grouped  round  Sugriva. 

Meanwhile,  under  Rama's  command,  Lakshmana,  assisted 
by  Bibishana,  distributed  his  innumerable  divisions  at  each 
gate.  Behind  Rama,  Sushena  and  Jarabavan,  those  lions  among 
the  monkeys,  possessing  the  teeth  of  tigers,  furnished  with  trees 
and  rocks,  waited  delightedly  for  the  signal  to  fight.  Lashing 
their  tails  feverishly,  they  used  their  jaws  and  nails  as  weapons ; 
trembling  in  every  limb,  their  faces  were  set  grimly  and  they 
were  extremely  strong,  some  having  the  strength  of  ten 
elephants,  some  ten  times  more  powerful,  some  equalling  a 
thousand  elephants  in  might  and  there  were  some  who  had  the 
vigour  of  a  million  elephants  and  even  more,  for  the  might  of 
those  monkey  leaders  was  immeasurable !  Marvellous  and 
astonishing  was  the  gathering  of  those  monkey  forces  resembling 
a  cloud  of  locusts !  The  earth  and  the  air  were  filled  with 
monkeys  rushing  towards  Lanka  or  already  stationed  beneath 
its  walls.  By  hundreds  and  hundreds  of  thousands,  bears  and 
monkeys  poured  towards  the  gates  of  Lanka  that  others  assailed 
on  every  side.  The  hills  disappeared  completely  under  that 
98 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

host  of  Plavamgamas,  numbering  millions,  who  were  ranging 
round  the  city  and  those  heroic  monkeys,  with  tree  trunks 
in  their  hands,  surrounded  the  whole  of  Lanka  that  even  the 
winds  were  unable  to  penetrate. 

Then  the  titans,  who  in  their  valour  rivalled  Shafcra,  seeing 
themselves  besieged  by  those  monkeys  like  massed  clouds,  were 
struck  with  a  sudden  terror,  and,  as  they  broke  rank,  a 
tremendous  clamour  arose  from  that  host  of  combatants  which 
resembled  the  roar  of  the  ocean  beating  against  the  shore !  At 
this  tumult,  the  whole  of  Lanka  with  its  ramparts,  arches,  hills, 
woods  and  forests,  began  to  tremble. 

Under  the  direction  of  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Sugriva,  that 
army  became  even  more  invincible  than  the  hosts  of  the  Gods 
and  titans.  Raghava,  however,  having  ranged  his  forces  in 
order  to  wipe  out  the  demons,  took  counsel  with  his  ministers 
and  pondered  deeply  again  and  again.  Desiring  to  act  without 
delay  and  with  circumspection,  he,  in  his  consummate  experience 
with  Bibishana's  approbation,  calling  to  mind  the  duty  of  kings1, 
summoned  Bali's  son,  Angada  and  said  to  him : — 

"  Go  My  Friend  on  my  behalf  and,  passing  through  the  Gty 
of  Lanka  without  fear,  say  to  Dashagriva : — '  Thou  hast 
sacrificed  thy  renown,  destroyed  thy  kingdom  and,  in  thine 
haste  to  die,  hast  lost  thy  wits !  Rishis,  Devas,  Gandharvas, 
Apsaras,  Nagas,  Yakshas  and  kings,  O  Ranger  of  the  Night, 
have  been  oppressed  by  thee  in  thy  reckless  pride.  O  Titan, 
from  now  on,  that  arrogance,  begot  of  the  boon  thou  didst 
receive  from  Swyambhu,  shall  be  subdued !  I  shall  inflict  a 
fitting  penalty  for  thy  ruthless  abduction  of  my  consort ;  it  is 
with  the  Rod  of  Chastisement,  that  I  have  stationed  myself  at 
Lanka's  gates.*  Having  displayed  thy  martial  valour,  slain  by 
me  thou  shalt  attain  the  region  of  the  Gods  !  Do  thou  demon- 
strate the  same  courage  that  thou  didst  employ  in  bearing  Ska 
away  from  me,  having  first  deceived  me  by  magic  arts.  O 
Most  Vile  of  Titans,  I  shall  rid  the  earth  of  titans  with  my 
pointed  shafts,  if  thou  dost  not  make  an  appeal  to  my  clemency 
by  returning  Maithili  to  me. 

1  Doty  of  Kings — If  a  king  is  able  to  accomplish  his  purpose  by  conciliation, 
he  must  not  use  force. 

•  That  is,  in  the  form  of  Dandadhara,  a  name  of  Death  as  the  Bearer  of 
the  Rod  of  Retribution.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  *  That  virtuous  prince  of  the  titans,  the  illustrious  Bibishana, 
who  is  here,  will  undoubtedly  reign  in  Lanka  without  opposition. 
Nay,  it  is  not  fitting  that,  even  for  an  instant,  the  crown  should 
belong  to  one  as  perfidious  as  thou  art,  a  wicked  creature  who 
surroundest  thyself  with  fools  and  who  is  not  conversant  with  the 
Self! 

"  *  Enter  into  combat  with  me,  O  Titan,  exert  thy  strength  and 
valour  in  the  fight,  mine  arrows  will  chasten  thee  and  thou  wilt 
be  subdued !  Even  shouldst  thou  range  the  Three  Worlds  in 
the  form  of  a  bird,  O  Night-ranger,  my  glance  would  follow 
thee  and  thou  wouldst  not  return  alive.  I  give  thee  this  salutory 
counsel — prepare  for  thine  obsequies,  let  Lanka  regain  her 
splendour,  thy  life  is  in  my  hands  1 '  " 

Furnished  with  Rama's  instructions,  the  son  of  Tara  ascended 
into  the  air,  like  unto  the  God  bearing  away  a  sacrificial  offering, 
and  in  an  instant  arrived  at  Ravana's  palace  where  he  beheld  him 
seated  at  ease  amidst  his  ministers. 

That  youthful  Prince  of  the  Monkeys,  Angada  of  golden 
bracelets,  like  a  flaming  torch  descended  close  to  the  king  and 
having  made  himself  known,  addressed  the  whole  of  Rama's 
exceedingly  significant  speech,  without  adding  or  subtracting 
anything,  to  him  in  the  presence  of  his  court,  saying : — 

"  I  am  the  messenger  of  the  King  of  Koshala,  Rama  of 
imperishable  exploits.  I  am  the  son  of  Bali,  Angada  is  my 
name ;  perchance  thou  hast  heard  of  me  ?  The  descendant  of 
Raghu,  Rama,  the  increaser  of  Kaushalya's  delight,  speaks  thus 
to  thee : — 

"'Come  forth  and  enter  into  combat  with  me!  Manifest 
thy  valour !  I  shall  destroy  thee,  thy  counsellors,  thy  sons, 
relatives  and  allies.  Thou  being  dead,  the  Three  Worlds  will 
cease  to  be  troubled,  O  Thou  whose  enemies  are  the  Devas, 
Danavas,  Yakshas,  Gandharvas,  Uragas  and  Rakshasas ;  thou 
thorn  in  the  side  of  the  ascetics  !  Bibishana  will  become  king 
when  thou  art  slain  by  me,  if  thou  dost  not  return  Vaidehi, 
having  paid  her  every  homage,  and  cast  thyself  at  my  feet  1 '  " 

Hearing  these  harsh  words  from  that  lion  among  the 
monkeys,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  infuriated,  issued  the  following 
command  repeatedly  to  his  attendants,  saying: — "Seize  him 
and  put  him  to  death ! " 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

On  this  order  being  given  by  Ravana,  Angada,  who  in  his 
splendour  resembled  a  blazing  torch,  was  seized  by  four 
terrible  titans  and  the  son  of  Tara  suffered  himself  to  be  made 
captive,  without  offering  any  resistance,  for  that  valiant  warrior 
desired  to  display  his  prowess  to  the  host  of  Yatudhanas. 
Thereafter,  seizing  three  of  the  titans,  like  unto  serpents  in  his 
arms,  he  leapt  on  to  the  palace  that  resembled  a  mountain. 
Shaken  by  his  impetuous  bound  the  three  titans  fell  to  the 
ground  under  the  eyes  of  their  king.  Then  the  powerful  son  of 
Bali  scaled  the  palace  up  to  its  roof,  which  equalled  the  summit 
of  a  mountain  in  height,  and  the  impact  of  his  bounds  caused  it  to 
crumble  before  Dashagriva's  gaze  as  a  peak  in  the  Himalayas 
is  shattered  by  lightning. 

Having  destroyed  the  roof  of  the  palace,  Angada  proclaimed 
his  name  and  with  a  triumphant  roar  rose  into  the  air.  To  the 
exceeding  terror  of  the  titans  and  the  great  delight  of  the  apes, 
he  alighted  in  the  midst  of  the  monkeys  beside  Rama. 

Thereupon  Ravana,  transported  with  anger,  giving  himself 
up  for  lost  began  to  sigh  heavily.  Meanwhile  Rama,  who  was 
surrounded  by  Plavamgamas  emitting  joyful  cries,  eager  to 
destroy  his  adversary,  advanced  to  meet  him  in  combat. 

Now  Sushena  was  at  the  head  of  innumerable  monkeys  who 
were  able  to  change  their  form  at  will  and,  under  the  order  of 
Sugriva,  he  patrolled  the  gates  and  that  invincible  warrior 
resembled  the  moon  moving  amidst  the  stars. 

Seeing  the  hundreds  of  divisions  encamped  under  the  walls 
of  Lanka  and  marshalled  on  the  shores  of  the  sea,  the  titans  were 
amazed  whilst  some  were  terror-struck  and  others,  overjoyed  at 
the  prospect  of  fighting,  leapt  in  exultation.  Beholding 
those  hosts  occupying  the  whole  space  between  the  walls  and 
the  moat,  however,  and  seeing  the  monkeys  like  unto  a  second 
rampart,  those  rangers  of  the  night,  cast  down,  cried  out : — 
"  Woe !  Alas  !  "  in  their  terror. 

In  the  midst  of  that  appalling  tumult,  the  soldiers  of  Ravana 
seized  hold  of  their  powerful  weapons  and  advanced  like  the 
winds  that  blow  at  the  dissolution  of  the  worlds. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER    42 

The  Titans  make  a  Sortie 

Then  those  titans  approached  the  abode  of  Ravana  and  informed 
him  that  Rama  and  the  monkeys  had  laid  siege  to  the  city. 

This  news  enraged  that  Ranger  of  the  Night,  who,  repeating 
his  former  commands  went  up  into  the  palace.  From  there 
he  surveyed  Lanka  with  its  hilis,  woods  and  groves,  which 
was  besieged  on  all  sides  by  countless  divisions  of  monkeys, 
eager  to  fight.  Beholding  the  earth  all  brown  with  innumerable 
Plavagas,  in  great  perplexity  he  reflected  :  "  How  can  they  be 
exterminated  ?  " 

Having  pondered  long,  Ravana  regained  his  confidence  and, 
opening  his  great  eyes  wide,  he  gazed  on  Raghava  and  the  simian 
battalions. 

Meanwhile  Rama,  at  the  head  of  his  army  was  rapidly 
advancing  on  Lanka  which  was  guarded  on  all  sides  and  thronged 
with  titans.  Thereafter  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  seeing  that  city 
furnished  with  flags  and  banners,  remembered  Sita  and  was 
filled  with  anguish.  He  reflected  "  That  daughter  of  Janaka 
whose  eyes  resemble  a  young  doe's,  will  be  a  prey  to  anxiety  on 
my  account !  Consumed  with  grief  and  emaciated,  she  is 
pining  away,  the  bare  ground  her  bed !  " 

Reflecting  on  the  sufferings  of  Vaidehi,  the  virtuous  Raghava 
speedily  issued  a  command  to  the  monkeys  to  prepare  for  the 
enemy's  destruction. 

Hearing  the  order  of  Raghava  of  imperishable  exploits,  the 
Plavagas,  urging  each  other  on,  filled  the  air  with  their  roaring. 

"  Let  us  demolish  Lanka  with  rocks  and  stones  or  with  our 
fists  alone  "  was  the  resolve  of  the  monkey  leaders  and,  under 
the  eyes  of  the  King  of  the  Titans,  in  order  to  accomplish  Rama's 
cherished  desire,  those  troops  divided  themselves  into  columns 
and  began  to  scale  the  heights  of  Lanka.  Hurling  themselves 
on  that  city  with  rocks  and  trees,  those  golden-hued  Plavamgamas 
of  coppery  countenance,  willing  to  lay  down  their  lives  in 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Rama's  service,  destroyed  innumerable  battlements,  ramparts 
and  arches  with  blows  from  trees,  rocks  and  fists  and  filled  the 
moats  and  trenches  of  clear  water  with  sand,  stones,  grass  and  logs. 

The  commanders  led  their  divisions  by  thousands  and 
hundreds  of  millions  of  thousands  to  attack  Lanka  and  the 
Plavamgamas  tore  up  the  golden  arches,  broke  down  the  gates, 
that  equalled  the  peak  of  Kailasha  in  height  and  from  the 
sides  and  the  centre,  hurled  themselves  on  the  city  like  great 
elephants  with  cries  of  "  Victory  to  the  mighty  Rama  and 
the  valiant  Lakshmana  !  "  "  Victory  to  Sugriva  protected  fay 
Raghava !  "  Shouting  thus,  the  monkeys,  who  were  able  to 
change  their  form  at  will,  roaring,  rushed  to  attack  the  city. 

Virabahu,  Subahu,  Nala  and  Fanasa,  having  demolished  some 
of  the  outposts,  reached  the  foot  of  the  walls  and  assigned  each 
column  to  a  post  of  attack.  The  eastern  gate  was  besieged  by 
the  valiant  Kumuda  surrounded  by  ten  kotis  of  triumphant 
monkeys ;  his  lieutenants  were  Prasabha  and  the  long-armed 
Fanasa,  who  were  at  the  head  of  those  forces. 

At  the  southern  gate  was  the  warrior  Shatabali,  a  monkey  of 
proved  valour,  who  was  stationed  with  twenty  kotis  to  obstruct 
the  exit.  Sushena,  the  father  of  Tara,  full  of  courage  and 
strength,  with  a  hundred  thousand  monkeys  surrounded  the 
western  gate.  The  northern  gate  was  blockaded  by  the  mighty 
Rama  assisted  by  Saumitri  and  Sugriva,  the  King  of  the 
Monkeys. 

The  colossal  Golangula,  Gavaksha,  of  grim  aspect  and 
immense  energy,  supported  one  of  Rama's  flanks  with  a  koti  of 
warriors  and  the  valiant  Dhumra,  scourger  of  his  foes,  supported 
the  other  flank  with  a  koti  of  bears  of  redoubtable  fury. 

The  intrepid  Bibishana,  attended  by  his  loyal  ministers, 
followed  his  ally,  the  heroic  Rama,  everywhere,  whilst  Gaja, 
Gavaksha,  Gavaya,  Sharabha  and  Gandhamadana  patrolled 
every  side  in  defence  of  the  simian  army. 

Meanwhile,  his  heart  filled  with  rage,  the  King  of  the  Titans 
ordered  his  troops  to  make  a  rapid  sortie.  At  this  command 
falling  from  Ravana's  lips,  a  tremendous  clamour  arose  among 
the  rangers  of  the  night  and  the  sound  of  kettledrums,  their 
discs  white  as  the  moon,  on  which  the  titans  beat  with  sticks  of 
gold,  broke  out  on  every  side,  while  hundreds  and  thousands  of 
103 


THE    R'AMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

trumpets  blared  forth}  blown  by  the  titans  with  their  cheeks 
extended  to  the  full.  With  their  dark  limbs  adorned  with 
ornaments  and  their  conches,  those  rangers  of  the  night 
resembled  clouds  bordered  with  lightning  or  rows  of  cranes ; 
and  their  battalions  advanced  gaily  under  Ravana's  imperious 
commands  as,  at  the  time  of  Pralaya,  the  tumultuous  sea 
overflows. 

At  that  moment  from  every  side,  a  clamour  arose  from  the 
army  of  the  monkeys  which  filled  Malaya  with  its  plains, 
valleys  and  chasms,  and  the  sound  of  the  trumpets  and  drums 
and  the  leonine  roars  of  those  warriors  re-echoed  over  the  earth, 
sky  and  sea,  as  also  the  trumpeting  of  elephants,  the  neighing 
of  horses,  the  clatter  of  chariot  wheels  and  the  thunder  of  the 
titans  marching. 

Thereafter  a  terrible  struggle  ensued  between  the  monkeys  and 
the  titans  as,  in  former  times  between  Gods  and  Asuras.  With 
their  naming  maces,  their  spears,  harpoons  and  axes,  the  titans, 
demonstrating  their  native  prowess,  struck  the  army  of  the 
monkeys  and  from  their  side,  those  gigantic  apes  attacked  their 
adversaries  ferociously  with  blows  from  trees,  rocks,  teeth  and 
nails. 

"  Victory  to  King  Sugriva  !  "  yelled  the  monkeys,  "  May  our 
Sovereign  prevail ! "  shouted  the  titans  and  each  proclaimed 
his  name,  while  other  demons,  standing  on  the  walls,  hacked  at 
the  monkeys  below  with  hooks  and  harpoons  and  they,  in- 
furiated, leapt  into  the  air  and  dragged  down  those  soldiers 
stationed  on  the  walls  by  seizing  them  with  their  arms,  and 
that  conflict  between  demons  and  monkeys  was  appalling  and 
the  earth  was  covered  with  mud  and  flesh  in  that  astonishing 
fight. 


CHAPTER    43 

The  Conflict  between  the  Monkeys  and  Titans 

Those  high-souled  monkey  troops  fought  with  terrible  ferocity 

whilst  the  titans  wakened  the  ten  regions  as,  mounted  on  steeds 

with  golden  trappings  or  elephants  bright  as  fire  or  in  cars 

104 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

flashing  like  the  sun,  they  issued  forth  clad  in  marvellous  suits 
of  mail,  eager  to  triumph  in  Havana's  name. 

On  their  side,  the  mighty  army  of  monkeys,  burning  for 
victory,  hurled  themselves  on  those  demons  of  formidable 
exploits  and  extraordinary  duels  arose  between  titans  and 
monkeys  who  rushed  upon  each  other. 

As  Tryambaka  fought  against  Andhaka,  so  did  the  son  of  Bali, 
Angada,  fight  with  Indrajita,  who  was  endowed  with  immense 
energy.  Prajangha  was  attacked  by  the  ever  indomitable 
Sampati  and  the  Monkey  Hanuman  measured  his  strength  with 
Jambumali.  A  prey  to  violent  anger,  Bibishana,  the  younger 
brother  of  Ravana,  entered  into  a  furious  combat  with  the 
exceedingly  impetuous  Shatrughna.  The  valiant  Gaja  fought 
with  the  Titan  Tapana  and  the  powerful  Nila  with  Nikumbha. 
That  India  of  Monkeys,  Sugriva,  attacked  Praghasa  with 
violence  and  the  fortunate  Lakshmana  engaged  in  combat  with 
Virupaksha.  The  unapproachable  Agniketu  with  the  Titan 
Rashmiketu,  Mitraghna  and  Yajnakopa  unitedly  entered  into 
combat  with  Rama,  Vajramushti  fought  against  Mainda  and 
Ashanipratha  against  Dvivida,  those  two  foremost  of  monkeys 
with  the  greatest  of  titans.  The  valiant  son  of  Dharma, 
Sushena,  that  great  monkey  of  illustrious  name,  grappled 
with  Vidyunmalin  and,  from  every  side,  other  monkeys 
heroically  engaged  in  countless  duels  with  other  titans.  Then 
an  appalling  batde,  causing  the  hair  to  stand  on  end,  took  place 
between  titans  and  monkeys  who  were  full  of  prowess  and  eager 
to  triumph. 

From  the  bodies  of  those  monkeys  and  rangers  of  the  night, 
torrents  flowed,  their  hair  being  the  grass,  their  blood  the  water 
bearing  away  heaps  of  corpses. 

As  Shatakratu  with  his  thunderbolt,  so  Indrajita,  with  his 
mace,  in  fury,  struck  at  Angada  but  that  intrepid  destroyer  of 
enemy  hosts  shattered  his  chariot,  the  framework  of  which  being 
encrusted  with  gold,  and  slew  his  horses  and  driver.  Sampati, 
wounded  by  Parjangha  with  three  arrows,  struck  him  over  the 
head  with  an  Ashvakarna  Tree ;  Jambumali,  standing  in  his 
chariot,  full  of  strength  and  fury  tore  open  Hanuman's  breast 
in  the  fight  with  the  force  of  his  driving,  but  he,  who  was  born 
of  the  Wind-god,  approaching  that  car,  soon  overthrew  it  with 
105 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  palm  of  his  hand.  The  redoubtable  Pratapana,  yelling, 
rushed  on  Nala,  who  with  his  limbs  pierced  by  the  pointed 
shafts  of  that  skilful  titan,  suddenly  scratched  out  his  eyes. 

As  Praghasa  appeared  to  be  consuming  the  hosts  of  the  King 
of  the  Monkeys,  Sugriva  hastily  struck  him  with  a  Saptaparna 
Tree,  while  Lakshmana,  overwhelmed  by  a  hail  of  missiles  by 
Virupaksha,  that  titan  of  ferocious  aspect,  struck  him  down  with 
a  single  blow.  Thereafter  the  indomitable  Agniketu,  the  Titans 
Rashmiketu,  Mitraghna  and  Yajnakopa  sought  to  consume  Rama 
with  their  arrows,  whereupon  he,  in  fury,  with  four  formidable 
shafts,  resembling  tongues  of  fire,  severed  the  heads  of  all  four 
in  the  struggle.  Vajramushti,  struck  by  a  blow  from  Mainda's 
fist  in  the  fight,  was  overthrown  with  his  chariot,  driver  and 
horses,  which  resembled  an  aerial  car  belonging  to  the  Gods ; 
Nikumbha  battling  against  Nila,  who  was  like  unto  a  piece  of 
collyrium,  pierced  him  with  his  whetted  shafts  as  the  sun  with 
its  rays  pierces  a  cloud  ;  and,  again  and  again  that  deft-handed 
ranger  of  the  night  Nikumbha,  with  a  hundred  arrows  wounded 
Nila  in  the  fray  whereupon  that  monkey  began  to  laugh  and 
seizing  the  wheel  of  his  adversary's  chariot,  he  who  resembled 
Vishnu  on  the  battlefield,  severed  the  head  of  that  titan  and  that 
of  his  charioteer. 

Dvivida,  whose  impact  was  like  unto  a  flash  of  lightning, 
struck  Samaprabha  with  a  great  rock  at  which  the  titans  stared 
in  amazement  and  that  foremost  of  monkeys,  Dvivida,  who 
fought  with  blows  of  trees,  was  pierced  in  his  turn  with  arrows 
resembling  lightning  and  his  limbs  being  lacerated  by  those 
shafts,  that  monkey  grew  enraged  and  with  a  single  blow  from 
a  Sala  Tree  struck  down  the  titan,  his  chariot  and  his  horses. 

Thereafter  Vidyunmalin  repeatedly  emitting  loud  cries,  stand- 
ing in  his  car,  wounded  Sushena  with  gold  encrusted  arrows 
and  seeing  him,  that  foremost  of  monkeys  suddenly  overthrew 
the  chariot  with  a  great  rock.  Vidyunmalin  however,  that  agile 
night  ranger,  sprang  down  from  his  car  and,  mace  in  hand, 
stood  ready  on  the  field  whereupon  that  lion  among  monkeys, 
infuriated,  seizing  a  great  rock,  rushed  at  the  titan  but  as  he 
precipitated  himself  upon  him,  Vidyunmalin  with  a  deft  stroke, 
wounded  him  in  the  belly  with  bis  mace.  Then  the  excellent 
Plavaga,  receiving  that  terrible  and  unexpected  blow  dealt  by 

106 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

his  opponent,  immediately  turned  and,  in  a  desperate  encounter, 
hurled  a  rock  upon  him.  Struck  by  that  missile,  Vidyunmalin, 
that  prowler  of  the  night,  his  chest  crushed,  fell  lifeless  on  the 
earth.  Thus,  under  the  blows  of  the  simian  warriors,  the 
heroic  titans  perished  in  a  series  of  hand  to  hand  encounters  as 
the  Daityas  under  the  blows  of  the  inhabitants  of  the  Celestial 
Region.  Bhallas  and  other  weapons,  maces,  lances,  darts, 
shattered  chariots,  war-horses  that  had  been  slain,  as  also 
elephants  from  whose  temples  ichor  exuded  and  the  bodies  of 
monkeys  and  titans,  with  wheels,  axles,  yokes  and  shafts  strewed 
the  earth ;  the  carnage  was  fearful,  a  veritable  jackal's  feast. 
The  headless  trunks  of  monkeys  and  titans  lay  in  heaps  every- 
where in  the  midst  of  that  appalling  conflict  which  resembled 
the  war  between  Gods  and  Asuras. 

In  that  stubborn  engagement,  decimated  by  the  foremost  of 
monkeys,  the  rangers  of  the  night  as  the  day  ended,  maddened 
by  the  smell  of  blood,  in  desperation  made  preparations  for  the 
morrow,  and  those  titans,  their  limbs  covered  with  blood, 
desired  nothing  so  greatly  as  that  night  should  fall. 


CHAPTER    44 

Angada's  Exploit 

During  the  combat  between  monkeys  and  titans,  the  sun  sank 
below  the  horizon,  giving  place  to  a  night  of  carriage.  In  their 
mutual  hostility,  monkeys  and  titans,  burning  for  victory, 
continued  to  fight  in  the  gathering  gloom. 

"  Art  thou  a  titan  ?  "  asked  the  monkeys — "  Art  thou  a 
monkey  ?  "  questioned  the  titans  and  struck  at  each  other  in  the 
darkness.  "  Strike !  "  "  Kill !  "  "  Come  hither  !  "  "  Why 
fleest  thou  ?  "  could  be  heard  in  that  appalling  struggle. 

Clad  in  mail,  the  titans,  their  dark  hue  intensified  by  the 
impenetrable  gloom,  resembled  bills  covered  with  woods 
abounding  in  phosphorescent  herbs  and,  transported  with  anger, 
they  bounded  forward  in  order  to  fall  on  the  Plavamgamas 
and  devour  them,  but  these  hurled  themselves  on  the  horses 
with  golden  plumes  and  the  banners,  like  unto  tongues  of  fire, 
107 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  with  indescribable  fury  tore  them  down  with  their  sharp 
claws.  Thus  did  those  mighty  monkey  warriors  sow  contusion 
amongst  the  titans  and  they  clawed  the  elephants  and  those 
mounted  upon  them  and  the  chariots  from  which  the  banners 
streamed,  breaking  them  to  pieces  with  their  teeth. 

Full  of  fury,  Lakshmana  and  Rama,  with  their  arrows 
resembling  venomous  snakes  pierced  the  foremost  of  the  titans, 
both  those  who  were  visible  and  those  who  were  invisible,  and 
the  dust  rising  from  the  hooves  of  the  horses  and  the  wheels 
of  the  chariots  filled  the  ears  and  eyes  of  the  combatants,  whilst 
rivers  of  blood  flowed  in  dreadful  torrents  in  that  ghastly  tumult 
which  caused  the  hair  to  stand  on  end. 

Meanwhile  the  sound  of  gongs  and  drums,  marvellous  to  hear, 
joined  to  the  blare  of  conches  and  the  rattle  of  wheels,  and  a 
terrible  clamour  arose  of  horses  neighing  mingling  with  the 
cries  of  the  wounded.  The  corpses  of  great  monkeys,  spears, 
maces  and  the  bodies  of  the  titans,  who  were  able  to  change 
their  form  at  will,  lay  in  heaps  as  high  as  a  mountain  on  the 
battlefield.  And  those  weapons  appeared  to  be  offered  up 
as  a  profusion  of  flowers  by  the  earth,  which  was  entirely  hidden 
and  rendered  impassable  by  rivers  of  blood.  That  fatal  night 
was  as  calamitous  to  the  monkeys  and  titans  as  the  night  of 
dissolution  wherein  no  being  survives. 

Meanwhile  the  titans,  aided  by  that  impenetrable  darkness, 
with  great  ferocity  showered  a  hail  of  weapons  on  Rama  and, 
yelling,  advanced  upon  him  in  fury  like  the  ocean  at  the  time  of 
the  destruction  of  all  creatures.  And  Rama,  in  the  twinkling 
of  an  eye,  with  six  shafts  resembling  tongues  of  Same  struck 
down  six  titans — the  indomitable  Yajnashatru,  Mahaparshwa, 
Mahodara,  Vajradamshtra  of  colossal  stature  and  the  two 
emissaries,  Shuka  and  Sarana.  With  his  innumerable  shafts, 
Rama  thereafter  pierced  them  all  in  their  vital  parts,  so  that 
under  that  shower  of  arrows  they  fled  from  the  field,  barely 
escaping  with  their  lives.  In  an  instant,  that  warrior  of  die 
great  car  tit  up  the  cardinal  points  with  his  formidable  missiles 
resembling  tongues  of  fire  so  that  every  quarter  became 
luminous.  All  those  titans,  who  dared  to  challenge  Rama, 
perished  like  moths  in  a  flame,  and  those  arrows,  whose  points 
were  of  fine  gold,  flying  everywhere,  illumined  the  night  as  do 
108 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

the  fireflies  in  autumn.  The  cries  of  the  titans  and  the  roll  of 
drums  increased  the  horrors  of  that  night  beyond  imagining 
and,  in  that  terrible  uproar  which  re-echoed  on  every  side,  it 
seemed  as  if  the  Mount  Trikuta  was  emitting  confused  murmurs 
from  its  innumerable  caves. 

The  gigantic  Golangulas,  black  as  night,  crushed  the  rangers 
of  the  night  in  their  arms  in  order  to  devour  them  and  Angada 
destroyed  his  foes  with  savagery  in  the  struggle. 

Then  Indrajita,  after  that  monkey  had  slain  his  steeds  and 
charioteer,  overcome  with  fatigue,  made  himself  invisible  and 
vanished. 

For  this  feat,  Bali's  son,  worthy  of  being  honoured,  was 
lauded  by  the  Gods  and  Rishis  as  also  by  the  brothers,  Rama 
and  Lakshmana.  All  beings  aware  of  the  prowess  of  the  mighty 
Indrajita  in  war,  witnessing  his  discomfiture  and,  beholding 
that  high-souled  one,  were  elated  and,  in  the  height  of  joy,  the 
monkeys  with  Sugriva  and  Bibishana,  seeing  the  enemy's 
defeat,  cried  out  "  Excellent !   Excellent !  " 

Meanwhile  Indrajita,  who  had  been  overcome  in  the  duel 
with  Bali's  son  of  redoubtable  deeds,  was  seized  with  violent 
wrath.  Rendering  himself  invisible  by  virtue  of  the  boon  he 
had  received  from  Brahma,  that  wicked  wretch,  who  was 
exhausted  by  the  fight,  transported  with  anger,  loosed  some 
sharp  arrows  bright  as  lightning  on  Rama  and  Lakshmana. 
On  die  field  of  battle,  in  his  rage,  he  pierced  the  limbs  of  those 
two  Raghavas  with  formidable  shafts  resembling  serpents. 
Enveloped  by  illusion,  he  sought  to  confuse  them  in  the  struggle 
and,  invisible  to  all  beings  through  his  magic  arts,  that  ranger 
of  the  night  bound  those  two  brothers  Rama  and  Lakshmana 
with  a  network  of  arrows.  Then  the  monkeys  beheld  the  two 
warriors,  those  lions  among  men,  enmeshed  by  the  serpentine 
darts  of  that  furious  titan.  Not  being  able  to  overcome  those 
two  princes  in  his  manifest  form,  the  son  of  the  King  of  the 
Titans,  in  his  perversity,  had  recourse  to  magic  in  order  to  make 
them  captive.

CHAPTER    45 

Rama  and  Lakshmana  are  struck  doztm  by  Indrajita 

Anxious  to  ascertain  what  had  become  of  Indrajita,  Rama, 
that  illustrious  and  mighty  prince  sent  out  ten  monkey  leaders 
in  his  pursuit ;  the  two  sons  of  Sushena,  the  monkey,  General 
Nila,  Angada  the  son  of  Bah,  the  valiant  Sharabha,  Dvivida, 
Hanuman,  the  exceedingly  courageous  Sanuprastha,  Rishabha 
and  Rishabaskandha. 

Those  monkeys  flung  themselves  joyfully  into  the  air 
brandishing  huge  trunks  of  trees  in  order  to  explore  the  ten 
regions,  but  Ravani1,  by  means  of  his  arrows,  loosed  with  force 
from  the  most  excellent  of  bows,  arrested  their  impetuous  flight 
and  those  monkeys  of  terrific  bounds,  who  were  cruelly  pierced 
by  those  shafts,  were  unable  to  discern  Indrajita  in  the  darkness, 
as  the  sun  is  obscured  when  veiled  in  cloud.  With  those  darts, 
that  lacerated  the  flesh,  the  titan  transfixed  Rama  and  Lakshmana 
and  remained  master  of  the  field  and  there  was  no  part  of  Rama 
or  Lakshmana's  body  that  was  not  pierced  by  those  serpentine 
shafts  so  that  streams  of  blood  flowed  from  their  gaping  wounds, 
and  they  appeared  like  two  Kimshuka  Trees  in  flower. 

At  that  instant,  his  eyes  inflamed,  Ravana's  son,  who  resembled 
a  mass  of  collyrium  mixed  with  oil,  though  still  invisible,  said 
to  those  two  brothers  : — "  When  I,  making  myself  invisible, 
enter  into  combat,  even  the  Chief  of  the  Gods,  Shakra  himself, 
is  not  able  to  discern  or  approach  me,  how  much  less  you  two! 
O  Descendants  of  Raghu,  having  imprisoned  you  in  this  network 
of  plumed  darts,  I,  yielding  myself  up  to  the  violence  of  my 
wrath,  am  about  to  dispatch  you  to  the  region  of  Yama  !  " 

Thus  addressing  those  virtuous  brothers,  Rama  and 
Lakshmana,  he  pierced  them  afresh  with  his  pointed  arrows 
shouting  exultantly. 

Resembling  a  heap  of  antimony,  the  swarthy  Indrajita, 
stretching  his  immense  bow,  let  fly  an  even  thicker  shower  of

formidable  arrows  in  the  fight.  That  warrior,  who  knew  how  to 
make  his  darts  pierce  Rama  and  Lakshmana's  vital  parts,  set  up 
a  continual  shouting  and  the  two  princes  in  the  forefront  of 
battle,  imprisoned  in  the  net  of  arrows  and  darts,  in  the  twinkling 
of  an  eye,  became  incapable  of  distinguishing  anything.  Para- 
lysed, pierced  in  their  vital  pans,  exhausted,  those  two  mighty 
and  courageous  archers  fell  to  the  earth,  they  who  were  her 
lords  !  Lying  on  that  heroes'  bed,  those  two  warriors,  covered 
with  blood,  their  limbs  bristling  with  arrows,  swooned  away 
in  their  extremity.  And  there  was  not  a  hair's  breadth  on 
their  bodies  from  the  tips  of  their  fingers  to  the  end  of  their 
feet  that  was  not  lacerated,  pricked  and  pierced  by  those 
irresistible  darts  and  from  both  those  warriors  who  had  been 
struck  down  by  that  ferocious  titan,  able  to  change  his  shape 
at  will,  the  hot  blood  gushed  forth  as  water  from  a  spring. 
And  Rama  fell  first,  his  vital  parts  pierced  by  the  shafts  of  the 
wrathful  Indrajita,  who  had  formerly  vanquished  Shakra,  and 
Havana's  son  riddled  Raghava's  body  with  smooth  and  polished 
darts  as  thick  as  dust  clouds.  Naracas,  Demi-naracas,  Bhallas, 
Anjalis,  Vatsadantas,  Sinhadantas,1  and  those  shafts  like  unto 
razors  fell  on  that  warrior,  who  lay  on  the  earth  like  a  hero, 
allowing  his  golden  bow,  which  was  severed,  to  sink  from  his 
grasp. 

Beholding  Rama,  that  lion  among  men,  fall  under  a  hail  of 
arrows,  Lakshmana  gave  up  all  hope  of  living  and  he  was 
overcome  by  grief  on  beholding  the  lotus-eyed  Rama,  his  refuge, 
who  ever  delighted  in  battle,  lying  on  the  earth. 

The  monkeys  too,  witnessing  this,  suffered  extreme  distress 
and,  their  eyes  full  of  tears,  overcome  with  despair,  emitted 
mournful  cries ;  and  while  those  two  warriors  lay  unconscious 
on  that  heroes'  bed,  the  monkeys  surrounded  them  and, 
assembling  there,  with  the  son  of  the  Wind  at  their  head, 
remained  inconsolable  and  a  prey  to  despair.

CHAPTER    46 

The  despair  of  Sugriva  and  his  Army.    Bibishana 
reassures  him 

Meanwhile  those  inhabitants  of  the  woods,  surveying  the  earth 
and  the  sky,  beheld  the  brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  covered 
with  arrows  and  the  titan  resting,  like  unto  Indra  having  loosed 
the  rains.  Accompanied  by  Sugriva,  Bibishana,  lamenting, 
came  to  that  place  in  haste,  and  Nila,  Dvivida,  Mainda,  Sushena, 
Kumuda,  Angada  and  Hanuman  approached,  weeping  for  the 
sons  of  Raghu. 

Breathing  but  faintly,  bathed  in  blood,  riddled  with  in- 
numerable darts,  motionless,  they  lay  stretched  on  a  bed  of 
arrows  sighing  like  serpents,  washed  in  blood,  resembling  two 
golden  standards,  and  those  warriors,  lying  on  a  hero's  couch, 
were  surrounded  by  monkey  leaders  whose  eyes  were  suffused 
with  tears. 

Beholding  the  two  Raghavas  pierced  with  darts,  a  profound 
emotion  stirred  those  monkeys,  who  were  accompanied  by 
Bibishana,  and  they  surveyed  the  four  quarters  without  being 
able  to  discover  Ravani,  who  had  veiled  himself  in  his  magic 
during  the  fight.  But  while  he  was  hidden  by  his  occult 
power,  Bibishana,  also  having  recourse  to  magic  arts,  looking 
round,  beheld  his  nephew  of  incomparable  exploits,  who  was 
invincible  in  battle,  standing  nearby.  Although  that  warrior, 
who  had  no  peer  in  the  field,  had  made  himself  invisible  by 
virtue  of  the  boon  he  had  received,  he  was  recognized  by 
Bibishana,  who  was  full  of  energy,  glory  and  prowess. 

Indrajita,  however,  contemplating  his  own  feat,  gazed  on 
those  two  warriors  stretched  on  the  earth  and,  in  an  excess  of  joy, 
wishing  to  share  it  with  all  the  titans,  said  : — 

"  Those  two  mighty  brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  the 
slayers  of  Khara  and  Dushana,  are  now  struck  down  by  my 
darts  !    Even  were  they  aided  by  the  Gods  and  Asuras  with  the 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

hosts  of  Rishis,  they  would  never  be  able  to  release  themselves 
from  those  arrows  that  paralyse  them  !  I  have  overcome  Rama 
for  the  sake  of  my  sire,  who  is  a  prey  to  anxiety  and  fear,  passing 
the  three  watches  of  the  night  without  allowing  his  limbs  to  rest 
on  his  couch,  I  have  subdued  that  wretch,  who  destroys  all 
beings  to  their  very  root,  on  account  of  whom  the  whole  of 
Lanka  is  agitated  like  a  river  in  the  rainy  season.  As  clouds 
are  dispersed  in  the  autumn,  so  have  the  exploits  of  Rama  and 
Lakshmana  and  all  the  inhabitants  of  the  woods  been  rendered 
void." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  all  the  titans,  who  had  witnessed  the 
scene,  Ravani  began  to  assail  all  the  monkey  leaders.  First  he 
struck  down  Nila  with  nine  exceedingly  powerful  javelins, 
thereafter  he  wounded  Mainda  and  Dvivida  with  three  more 
and  that  mighty  bowman,  having  pierced  Jambavan  in  the  breast 
with  an  arrow,  loosed  ten  shafts  on  the  impetuous  Hanuman. 
Then  Ravani,  in  the  fight,  full  of  ire,  with  twin  arrows  pierced 
Gavaksha  and  Sharabha,  those  two  of  immeasurable  prowess, 
and  the  leader  of  the  Golangulas  and  the  son  of  Bali,  Angada, 
were  overcome  by  innumerable  darts  by  the  swift-coursing 
Ravani.  Transfixing  the  leading  monkeys  with  shafts  resembling 
tongues  of  fire,  that  mighty  and  colossal  son  of  Ravana  began 
to  shout  in  triumph  and,  having  overwhelmed  and  routed  the 
monkeys  with  a  hail  of  weapons,  that  long-armed  hero  burst  into 
loud  laughter,  exclaining : — 

"  Behold,  O  Titans,  with  a  formidable  net  I  have  bound  those 
two  brothers  in  the  presence  of  their  forces  !  " 

Thus  did  he  speak  and  all  those  titans,  versed  in  magic,  were 
exceedingly  delighted  by  his  exploit  and  cheered  him  un- 
animously with  a  roar  like  unto  thunder,  crying : —  "  Rama  is 
dead ! "  and  hearing  these  tidings  and  beholding  the  two 
brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  lying  on  the  earth  without 
breath  or  movement,  they  all  paid  homage  to  Ravana's  son, 
reflecting  "  They  are  slain ! "  In  a  transport  of  joy,  Indrajita, 
victorious  in  conflict,  returned  to  Lanka  spreading  happiness 
among  the  Nairritas. 

A  great  fear  however  had  taken  possession  of  Sugriva,  who 
was  overcome  with  terror  on  beholding  Rama  and  Lakshmana 
riddled  with  arrows  and  pierced  in  every  limb  and  bone, 
"3 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

whereupon  Bibishana  said  to  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  who  was 
afflicted,  his  face  bathed  in  tears,  his  eyes  wild  with  terror : — 

"  Have  no  fear,  O  Sugriva,  stay  this  rain  of  tears ;  these  are 
the  fortunes  of  war ;  the  titan's  victory  is  not  assured ;  fate  may 
still  smile  upon  us,  O  Warrior.  These  two  heroes,  full  of  prowess 
will  recover  from  their  swoon.  Take  courage  and  inspire  me 
with  courage  also,  who  am  bereft  of  a  protector,  O  Monkey  1 
Death  cannot  strike  terror  in  those  who  find  their  felicity  in 
truth  and  justice." 

Thus  speaking,  Bibishana,  dipping  his  hand  in  water,  washed 
Sugriva's  beautiful  eyes  and,  after  taking  water  and  uttering  a 
sacred  formula,  the  virtuous  Bibishana  then  dried  the  face  of  that 
intelligent  King  of  the  Monkeys  and  addressing  him  in  words 
full  of  good  sense  and  comfort,  said : — 

"  This  is  not  the  moment,  O  Greatest  of  Monkey  Kings,  to 
manifest  agitation,  excessive  emotion  in  such  a  situation  leads 
to  death,  therefore  abandon  this  faint-heartedness  that  will 
prove  thine  undoing  and  consider  how  thou  canst  best  serve  the 
troops.  Keep  watch  over  Rama  so  long  as  he  has  not  regained 
consciousness,  for  when  they  come  to  themselves,  the  two 
Kakutsthas  will  remove  all  fear  from  us.  This  is  nothing  to 
Rama  nor  is  he  dying,  and  Lakshmi1,  who  is  inaccessible  to  those 
who  are  doomed,  has  not  abandoned  him.  Therefore  pluck 
up  thy  courage  and  call  on  thy  prowess  while  I  seek  to  inspire 
the  ranks  with  renewed  confidence.  Those  monkeys,  their 
eyes  dilated,  trembling  and  discouraged  by  the  rumours  whis- 
pered from  ear  to  ear,  on  seeing  me  cheerfully  going  about 
amongst  the  ranks  of  the  army,  will  abandon  their  fears  like  a 
discarded  garland,  O  King  of  the  Monkeys !  " 

Having  reassured  Sugriva,  that  Indra  among  the  Titans, 
Bibishana,  passed  through  the  monkey  lines  reviving  their 
confidence. 

Meanwhile  Indrajita,  that  great  magician,  surrounded  by  all 
his  forces  re-entered  the  City  of  Lanka  and  sought  out  his  sire. 
Approaching  Ravana,  with  joined  palms,  he  imparted  the 
pleasant  tidings  to  him,  saying : — 

"  Rama  and  Lakshmana  are  slain  !  "  Then  Ravana  joyfully 
springing  up  in  the  midst  of  the  titans,  on  hearing  that  bis  two 

1  Goddess  of  prosperity.

enemies  had  succumbed,  smelt  the  head  of  his  son  and  in  great 
delight  questioned  him  concerning  the  matter. 

Being  interrogated  by  his  sire  regarding  what  had  taken  place, 
Indrajita  related  how  the  two  brothers,  bound  by  his  shafts,  were 
lying  without  strength  or  movement.  On  hearing  those  tidings 
from  that  warrior  of  the  great  car,  joy  flooded  Ravana's  inmost 
being  and  Dashagriva,  banishing  his  fears  regarding  the  son  of 
Dasaratha,  warmly  felicitated  his  offspring  who  stood  beside  him. 


CHAPTER    47 

Sita  sees  Rama  and  Lakshmana  lying  on  the  Battlefield 

The  son  of  Ravana  having  returned  to  Lanka,  his  purpose 
accomplished,  the  leading  monkeys  surrounded  Raghava  in 
order  to  watch  over  him,  and  Hanuman,  Angada,  Nila,  Sushena, 
Kumuda,  Nala,  Gaja,  Gavaksha,  Panasa,  Sanuprastha  and  the 
mighty  Jambavan  with  Sunda,  Rambha,  Shatabali  and  Prithu, 
having  re-organized  their  ranks,  alert,  armed  with  trees 
surveyed  the  quarters  of  the  sky  up  and  down  and  on  every  side 
and,  even  if  a  grass  stirred,  they  exclaimed  "  It  is  a  titan  !  " 

Ravana,  meanwhile,  full  of  joy  dismissed  bis  son  Indrajita 
and  thereafter  summoned  the  female  titans  who  guarded  Sita 
and  they  with  Trijata,  having  hastened  there  at  bis  command, 
were  addressed  by  that  monarch  in  his  delight  who  said  to 
them: — 

"  Inform  Vaidehi  that  Indrajita  has  slain  Rama  and 
Lakshmana !  Compel  her  to  enter  the  Pushpaka  Plane  and 
show  them  to  her  lying  on  the  field  of  battle !  Her  consort, 
the  One  depending  on  whom  rendered  her  so  proud  that  she 
refused  to  be  united  with  me,  lies  there  struck  down  with 
his  brother  in  the  presence  of  bis  army !  From  now  on,  free 
from  anxiety,  grief  and  expectation  of  re-union,  Maithili, 
adorned  in  all  her  jewels,  will  submit  herself  to  me.  To-day, 
beholding  Rama  with  Lakshmana  fallen  under  the  sway  of 
death  on  the  battlefield,  seeing  no  other  haven  and  hoping 
for  nought  else,  the  large-eyed  Sita  will  voluntarily  seek  refuge 
with  me  1 " 

«5 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

At  these  words  of  that  wicked  monarch,  they  all  replied — 
"  Be  it  so !  "  and  went  to  where  the  Pushpaka  Chariot  was, 
thereafter  ascending  it.  Taking  that  aerial  car,  the  female 
titans,  in  obedience  to  Ravana's  behests,  rejoined  Maithili  in 
the  Ashoka  Grove. 

There  they  found  her  overcome  with  the  grief  that  separation 
from  her  lord  caused  her,  nevertheless  they  placed  her  in  the 
Chariot  Pushpaka  and  when  they  were  seated  therein  with 
Trijata,  Ravana  took  her  round  the  city  garlanded  with  flags 
and  banners  and  at  the  same  time  the  delighted  Monarch  of 
the  Titans  caused  a  proclamation  to  be  made  in  Lanka  announcing 
that  Rama  as  also  Lakshmana  had  been  slain  by  Indrajita  in 
combat. 

Sita,  transported  with  Trijata  in  that  car,  beheld  the  monkey 
troops  who  had  been  slain  and  witnessed  the  joy  exhibited  by 
those  eaters  of  flesh  and  the  monkeys  afflicted  with  grief  standing 
round  Rama  and  Lakshmana.  And  she  beheld  those  two 
warriors  also,  lying  pierced  with  arrows,  unconscious,  riddled 
with  weapons,  their  armour  shattered,  their  bows  broken, 
transfixed  by  darts.  Those  two  brothers,  who  were  filled  with 
valour,  the  foremost  of  heroes  were  lying  stretched  on  the  earth 
resembling  two  youthful  sons  of  Pavaka. 

And  when  the  unfortunate  Maithili  beheld  those  two  intrepid 
lions  among  men,  pierced  with  spears,  she  broke  into  piteous 
lamentations,  and  the  dark-eyed  Sita,  the  daughter  of  janaka, 
of  faultless  limbs,  beholding  her  lord  and  Lakshmana  lying  on 
the  earth,  burst  into  sobs.  Exhausted  with  weeping  and  grief 
on  seeing  those  two  brothers  resembling  the  offspring  of  the 
Gods  and,  believing  them  to  be  dead,  overwhelmed  with 
affliction,  she  spoke  thus  ;— 


CHAPTER    48 

Sita's  Lamentations 

Seeing  her  lord  lying  on  the  earth  as  also  the  valiant  Lakshmana, 
Sita,  in  the  grief  that  overwhelmed  her,  gave  voice  to  her 
complaint,  saying : — 

116 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

"The  soothsayers,  reading  the  lineaments  of  my  body, 
prophesized  thus : — 

*  Thou  shalt  bear  sons  and  never  be  widowed  ! ' — now  that 
Rama  has  been  slain,  their  words  have  proved  to  be  untrue ! 
Since  Rama  is  slain,  those  who  predicted  that  I  should  be  the 
companion  and  consort  of  the  performer  of  great  sacrifices, 
have  uttered  a  falsehood !  Now  that  Rama  has  been  slain, 
those  soothsayers,  who  told  me  I  should  be  highly  honoured  by 
the  wives  of  warriors  and  kings,  are  proved  not  to  have  spoken 
truly  !  Now  that  Rama  has  been  slain,  the  astrologers  among 
the  brahmins,  who  openly  foretold  happiness  for  me,  are  proved 
to  have  spoken  falsely ! 

"  Yet  I  bear  the  marks  of  the  lotus  on  my  feet  by  which 
high-born  women  receive  the  supreme  consecration  with  their 
lords  at  their  coronation  nor  do  I  find  in  myself  any  marks  of 
ill-fortune  which  betoken  widowhood  in  those  who  are  ill- 
starred,  yet  all  the  auspicious  signs  appear  to  be  rendered  void 
for  me !  These  marks  of  the  lotus,  said  to  be  of  good  augury  by 
the  Pundits,  have  no  meaning  for  me,  now  that  Rama  is  slain ! 

"  My  locks  are  fine,  of  even  length  and  dark,  my  eyebrows 
meet,  my  legs  are  round  and  smooth,  my  teeth  evenly  separated, 
the  corners  of  my  eyes  are  shaped  like  the  conch,  my  breasts, 
bands,  feet  and  thighs  well  proportioned,  my  nails  smooth  and 
polished,  my  fingers  well-shaped,  my  breasts  touch  each  other 
and  have  depressed  nipples,  my  navel  too  is  deeply  indented,  my 
bosom  well-formed,  my  complexion  has  the  sheen  of  a  pearl, 
the  down  on  my  skin  is  soft.  It  is  said  I  possess  the  twelve 
auspicious  signs :  my  feet  and  hands  are  without  hollows  and 
marked  with  the  barley  corn1  and  my  smile  is  langorous.  Thus 
did  those,  who  interpret  the  marks  of  youthful  maidens,  speak 
of  me. 

"  Having  purified  Janasthana8,  received  the  tidings  of  my 
fate  and  crossed  the  impassable  ocean,  those  two  brothers  have 
perished  in  the  imprint  of  a  cow's  hoof.  Did  they  not  recollect 
(that  they  possessed)  the  arrows  of  Varuna,  Agni,  Indra  and 
Vayu,  as  also  the  Brahmashira  weapon  ?

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  By  means  of  magic  arts,  an  invisible  foe  has  slain  those  two, 
Rama  and  Lakshmana,  my  protectors,  who  are  equal  to  Vasava 
in  combat  and  I  am  now  bereft  of  any  support.  Nay,  if  he  had 
come  into  Rama's  presence,  he  would  not  have  returned  alive 
even  were  he  possessed  of  the  swiftness  of  thought  but  since 
Rama  and  his  brother  are  lying  struck  down  on  the  battlefield, 
there  is  no  burden  too  heavy  for  death  to  shoulder !  Fate  is 
inexorable.  I  do  not  weep  so  much  for  Rama  and  Lakshmana 
or  for  myself  or  my  mother  but  for  my  unfortunate  mother-in- 
law,  Kaushalya,  who  dwells  constantly  on  her  son's  return  after 
fulfilling  his  vows,  she  who  asks  herself,  *  When  shall  I  behold 
Lakshmana  and  Sita  with  Raghava  once  more  ?  * " 

Thus  did  Janaki  lament  and  Trijata  said  to  her : — "  Do  not 
despair,  O  Goddess,  thy  lord  lives  !  I  will  tell  thee  what 
powerful  considerations  have  convinced  me  that  those  two 
brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana  still  live,  O  Queen.  They  are, 
that  resolution  and  martial  ardour  do  not  animate  the  faces  of 
soldiers  who  have  lost  their  leader,  neither  would  the  celestial 
car,  Pushpaka,  have  brought  thee  hither,  O  Vaidehi,  if  those  two 
heroes  had  succumbed.  An  army  that  sees  its  valiant  commander 
fall  is  bereft  of  courage  and  wanders  aimlessly  about  on  tile 
battlefield  like  a  ship  which  has  lost  its  rudder.  Yet  there  is 
neither  confusion  nor  disorder  among  the  intrepid  forces  that 
mount  guard  over  the  two  Kakutsthas.  I  am  pointing  this  out 
to  thee  on  account  of  mine  affection  for  thee.  These  auspicious 
omens  should  re-assure  thee  fully,  for  know  well,  the  two 
Kakutsthas  are  not  dead,  I  hasten  to  tell  thee  this  out  of  love 
for  thee. 

"  I  have  never  spoken  what  is  not  true  to  thee  nor  shall  I 
ever  do  so,  O  Maithili,  for  by  thy  conduct  and  natural  gaiety 
thou  hast  found  a  place  in  my  heart !  Nay,  those  two  warriors 
are  not  able  to  be  vanquished  even  by  the  Gods  and  Asuras 
with  their  leaders.  This  is  what  I  have  observed  and  com- 
municate to  thee.  Yea,  there  is  a  great  marvel  to  be  seen,  O 
Maithili ;  behold  how,  fallen  under  those  shafts  and  deprived 
of  their  senses,  their  beauty  has  not  deserted  them. 

"  In  the  natural  course,  when  men  have  lost  their  lives,  their 
features  exhibit  appalling  alteration,  it  is  therefore  impossible 
that  these  two  do  not  still  live.  Banish  thy  grief  on  account  of

YUDDHA    KANDA 

Rama  and  Lakshmana,  abandon  thy  sorrow,  O  Daughter  of 
Janaka ! " 

At  these  words,  Sita,  who  resembled  a  daughter  of  the  Gods, 
with  joined  palms,  exclaimed  "  May  it  be  so !  " 

Meanwhile  the  Chariot  Pushpaka,  swift  as  the  wind,  had 
returned  and  the  plaintive  Sita  re-entered  the  city  with  Trijata, 
whereupon  descending  from  the  car,  she  entered  the  Ashoka 
Grove  with  the  female  titans. 

Having  returned  to  the  royal  enclosure  planted  with  in- 
numerable trees,  Sita,  recalling  the  two  princes  whom  she  had 
just  seen,  became  a  prey  to  extreme  grief. 


chapter  49 

Rama  returns  to  consciousness  and  weeps  over  Lakshmana 

Bound  by  those  formidable  weapons,  the  two  sons  of  Dasaratha, 
breathing  like  serpents,  lay  bleeding  on  the  earth. 

Those  foremost  of  monkeys,  the  valiant  companions  of 
Sugriva,  plunged  in  grief,  were  all  standing  round  the  two 
illustrious  warriors. 

Then  the  mighty  Raghava,  by  virtue  of  his  hardihood  and 
native  strength,  awoke  from  his  swoon  despite  the  shafts  that 
held  him  captive.  Beholding  his  brother  bleeding,  unconscious, 
tightly  bound  and  his  features  changed,  Rama,  full  of  grief, 
lamented  thus : — "  Of  what  use  to  me  is  the  recovery  of  Sita 
or  even  life  itself,  since  my  brother,  now  lying  before  mine  eyes, 
has  been  struck  down  in  the  fight  ?  It  were  possible  for  me  to 
find  a  consort  equal  to  Sita  in  this  world  of  mortals  but  not  a 
brother,  friend  and  comrade  in  arms  such  as  Lakshmana  ! 
If  he  has  returned  to  the  five  elements,  he,  the  increaser  of 
Sumitra's  joy,  I  will  yield  up  my  life  breaths  in  the  presence  of 
the  monkeys ! 

"  What  shall  I  say  to  my  mother,  Kaushalya,  or  to  Kaikeyi  ? 

If  I  return  without  Lakshmana,  how  shall  I  console  Sumitra 

trembling  and  crying  out  like  an  osprey,  who  sighs  for  her  son's 

return  from  whom  she  has  been  separated  so  long?    What 

119 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

answer  shall  I  give  to  Shatrughna  and  the  illustrious  Bharata 
when  I  return  without  the  one  who  followed  me  to  the  forest  ? 
Nay,  I  should  not  be  able  to  endure  Sumitra's  reproaches ; 
I  will  leave  my  body  here ;  I  am  unable  to  continue  living.  Woe 
unto  me  and  to  my  lack  of  nobility,  since,  through  my  fault, 
Lakshmana  has  fallen  and  lies  on  a  bed  of  arrows  as  one  who  has 
yielded  up  his  life ! 

"  O  Lakshmana,  thou  didst  ever  console  me  in  my  great 
misfortune  ;  now  that  thou  art  slain,  thou  wilt  no  longer  be  able 
to  allay  my  sufferings  by  thy  words.  Thou,  who,  in  this  battle, 
struck  down  innumerable  titans,  art  fallen,  pierced  by  darts, 
like  a  hero  on  the  selfsame  field.  Lying  on  a  bed  of  arrows, 
bathed  in  blood,  thou  art  nought  but  a  heap  of  weapons  !  It 
appears  as  if  the  sun  has  set  behind  the  Astachala  Mountains  ! 
Pierced  with  spears,  thy  limbs  express  thine  agony  without  the 
aid  of  words.  I  shall  follow  that  illustrious  warrior  to  the  region 
of  Yama,  as  he  accompanied  me  when  I  retired  to  the  forest ; 
he,  who  ever  loved  his  own  and  was  filled  with  devotion  for  me, 
lies  in  the  state  to  which  my  misdeeds  have  brought  him,  wretch 
that  I  am ! 

"  Even  when  deeply  provoked,  that  valiant  hero  never  uttered 
an  unpleasant  or  harsh  word ;  he  who  was  able  to  loose  five 
hundred  arrows  in  one  shot  and  who  excelled  Kartavirya 
himself  in  the  science  of  archery ;  Lakshmana,  who  was 
accustomed  to  a  rich  couch  and  who,  with  his  arrows  could 
sever  those  of  the  mighty  Shakra,  is  lying  slain  on  the  earth. 

"  Those  vain  words,  which  I  uttered,  will  undoubtedly 
consume  me  since  I  have  not  enthroned  Bibishana  as  King  of 
the  Titans  !  Return  at  once,  O  Sugriva,  since  bereft  of  my 
support  thou  and  thy  leaders  will  be  overcome  by  Ravana. 
Recross  the  sea  accompanied  by  thine  army  led  by  Angada  with 
Nila  and  Nala,  O  King.  I  am  fully  satisfied  by  the  great 
military  exploit  of  Hanuman,  impossible  to  any  other  and  by  that 
accomplished  by  the  King  of  the  Bears  and  the  General  of  the 
Golangulas.  That  which  Angada,  Mainda  and  Dvivida  did, 
the  terrible  combat  that  Kesarin  and  Sampati  sustained,  the 
formidable  struggle  in  which  Gavaya,  Gavaksha,  Sharabha, 
Gaja  and  other  monkeys,  who  are  willing  to  sacrifice  their  lives 
for  me,  took  part,  are  sufficient  for  me.    Nay,  it  is  not  possible 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

for  mortals  to  avoid  their  destiny.  O  Sugriva,  tearing  to  fail 
in  thy  duty,  thou  hast  done  all  that  a  friend  and  comrade  could 
do ;  all  that  is  due  to  friendship,  thou  hast  accomplished,  O 
Foremost  of  Monkeys !  I  take  leave  of  you  all ;  go  where 
it  seems  best  to  you  ! " 

Hearing  Rama  lament  thus,  the  monkeys  allowed  tears  to  fall 
from  their  reddened  eyes,  when,  at  that  moment,  Bibishana, 
having  established  order  in  the  ranks,  mace  in  hand  hurried  to 
rejoin  Raghava.  Seeing  him,  who  resembled  a  mass  of  collyrium, 
hastening  towards  them  thus,  the  monkeys  thinking  him  to  be 
Ravani,  tied  away. 


chaptsr  50 

Garuda  liberates  Rama  and  Lakshmana 

Meanwhile  the  illustrious  and  powerful  King  of  the  Monkeys 
enquired  saying : — "  What  does  this  stampede  signify  ?  The 
army  resembles  a  ship  amidst  the  waves  struck  by  a  tempest !  " 

Hearing  Sugriva's  speech,  Angada,  the  son  of  Bali,  answered : 

"  Dost  thou  not  see  Rama  and  Lakshmana  of  the  Great  Car, 
those  two  valiant  and  illustrious  sons  of  Dasaratha,  covered  with 
darts  lying  all  bloody  on  a  bed  of  arrows  ?  " 

Thereupon  that  Indra  among  monkeys,  Sugriva,  said  to  his 
son  : — "  To  my  mind  there  is  some  other  cause  why  the  monkeys, 
bewildered,  their  eyes  distended  with  terror,  are  throwing  down 
their  arms  in  order  to  flee  in  all  directions  without  shame  and 
without  looking  behind  them,  jostling  each  other  and  leaping 
over  those  who  have  fallen  1 " 

In  the  midst  of  this  turmoil,  the  warrior  Bibishana  came  there, 
a  great  mace  in  his  hand  and  said  "  Victory  to  Rama !  Victory 
to  Rama !"  and  Sugriva  observed  that  it  was  this  titan  who  had 
caused  the  panic  among  the  monkeys  whereat  he  addressed  the 
illustrious  King  of  the  Bears,  who  stood  near,  and  said : — 

"  It  is  Bibishana  who  has  come  hither  !  On  seeing  him  the 
monkeys,  seized  with  terror,  have  fled,  deeming  him  to  be 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Havana's  son ;  do  thou  rally  those  fugitives  immediately,  who, 
in  fear,  have  scattered  in  all  directions  and  inform  them  that  it  is 
Bibishana  who  has  come !  " 

In  obedience  to  Sugriva's  command,  Jambavan  perceiving 
it  to  be  Bibishana  and  recognizing  his  voice,  re-assured  the 
monkeys  and  arrested  the  stampede,  whereupon  freed  from 
anxiety  they  all  retraced  their  steps. 

Meanwhile  the  faithful  Bibishana,  on  beholding  Rama's  body 
as  also  Lakshmana's  covered  with  arrows,  was  overcome  with 
distress  in  his  turn.  Dipping  his  hand  in  water,  he  washed  their 
eyes,  but,  anguish  seizing  his  heart,  he  began  to  weep  and 
lament,  saying : — 

"  Behold  to  what  a  pass  these  two  powerful  and  valiant 
warriors  have  been  brought  by  that  titan  with  his  crafty  ways  ! 
The  son  of  my  brother,  that  wicked  youth  of  perverse  soul, 
in  his  demoniacal  cunning,  has  deceived  those  two  honourable 
fighters.  Pierced  by  arrows,  covered  with  blood,  they  are 
lying  on  the  earth  like  two  porcupines.  Those  two  gallant 
beings,  those  two  lions  among  men,  on  whom  depended  the 
position  to  which  I  aspired,  to  my  destruction  are  lying  here 
insensible.  I  am  as  one  dead  and,  deprived  of  the  hope  of 
becoming  king  am  lost,  whilst  my  rival  Ravana  sees  his  vow 
fulfilled  and  his  desires  realised  !  " 

Thus  did  Bibishana  lament,  whereupon  Sugriva  embraced 
him  and  that  magnanimous  King  of  the  Monkeys  spoke  to  him 
in  this  wise  : — 

"  O  Virtuous  Prince,  thou  shalt  certainly  reign  over  Lanka ; 
Ravana  and  his  son  will  not  achieve  their  purpose ;  the  injury 
done  to  Rama  and  Lakshmana  is  not  grave,  they  will  both 
emerge  from  their  swoon  and  destroy  Ravana  and  his  hordes 
in  battle. " 

When  he  had  thus  consoled  and  comforted  the  titan,  Sugriva 
issued  his  commands  to  Sushena,  his  stepfather,  who  stood 
before  him,  saying  : — 

"  Take  these  two  brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana  with  the 
foremost  of  the  monkey  divisions  to  Kishkindha,  till  these  two 
scourgers  of  their  foes  have  recovered  consciousness.  As  for 
me,  I  shall  slay  Ravana  with  his  son  and  his  relatives  and  bring 
back  Maithili  as  did  Shakra  the  prosperity  he  had  lost." 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Thus  did  that  King  of  the  Monkeys  speak  and  Sushena 
answered  him  saying : — 

"  Formerly  a  great  war  took  place  between  the  Devas  and 
Asuras  and,  by  making  themselves  invisible  again  and  again, 
the  Danavas  overcame  the  Gods  despite  their  skill  in  bearing 
arms.  Experienced  warriors  though  they  were,  wounded, 
unconscious  and  almost  deprived  of  life,  yet  Brihaspati  revived 
them  by  the  aid  of  remedies  accompanied  by  the  recitation  of 
sacred  formulas. 

"  Let  the  monkeys,  Sampari,  Fanasa  and  others  go  in  haste 
to  gather  those  simples  by  the  ocean  of  milk ;  undoubtedly 
those  monkeys  are  conversant  with  the  two  mountain  herbs, 
the  celestial  Samjivakarana  and  Vishalya,  which  were  created 
by  a  God.  From  the  bosom  of  the  milky  ocean  rise  the 
Mountains  Chandra  and  Drona,  where  the  divine  *  Amrita ' 
emerged  after  the  churning,1  it  is  there  that  these  miraculous 
herbs  are  to  be  found.  Let  the  Son  of  the  Wind,  Hanuman  go 
to  those  two  mountains  placed  in  that  vast  sea  by  the  Gods." 

As  he  was  speaking,  a  great  wind  arose  accompanied  by 
massed  clouds  and  lightning,  whipping  up  the  salty  waves  and 
causing  the  mountains  to  tremble  as  from  an  earthquake.  Under 
the  mighty  stroke  of  Vata's  wing  the  great  trees  fell  headlong 
into  the  briny  waters  of  the  sea,  their  branches  broken,  whilst 
terror  seized  the  great  snakes  who  inhabited  these  regions 
and  those  monsters  plunged  into  the  depths. 

Suddenly  Garuda,  the  valiant  son  of  Vinata  like  unto  a  blazing 
torch  appeared  to  all  those  monkeys  and,  on  beholding  him, 
the  serpents  who  bound  those  two  warriors  in  the  form  of 
mighty  arrows,  Med  away.  Thereafter  Suparna,  touching  the 
two  Kakutsthas  and  offering  them  his  good  wishes,  with  his 
hands  wiped  their  faces  that  shone  like  the  moon. 

Under  Vainateya's  touch,  the  wounds  of  both  were  closed  and 
their  bodies  immediately  assumed  a  brilliant  and  glowing  hue. 
Their  valour,  vigour,  strength,  endurance  and  resolution,  those 
great  qualities,  also  perspicacity,  intelligence  and  memory  were 
redoubled. 

Having  raised  up  those  equals  of  Vasava,  the  exceedingly 
valiant  Garuda  embraced  them  warmly  and  Rama  said  to  him : — 

1  Referring  to  the  churning  of  the  Ocean  by  Gods  and  Asuras. 

123 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Thanks  to  thy  beneficence  and  grace  we  have  both  been 
delivered  from  the  strange  evil  that  Ravana  brought  upon  us  and 
our  strength  has  returned.  As  in  the  presence  of  my  father 
Dasaratha,  or  my  grandfather  Aja,  in  thy  presence  also  my 
heart  is  filled  with  felicity.  Who  art  thou  endowed  with  a 
beauty  which  distinguishes  thee,  thou  bearing  crowns,  divine 
perfumes  and  celestial  ornaments,  the  raiment  which  clothes 
thee  being  free  from  dust  ?  " 

Then  the  extremely  illustrious  Vainateya,  who  was  full  of 
valour  and  the  Lord  of  Winged  Creatures,  his  heart  enraptured, 
addressed  Rama,  whose  eyes  sparkled  with  delight,  and  said : — 

"  I  am  thy  dear  friend,  O  Kakutstha,  thy  very  breath,  Garuda, 
who  have  come  hither  to  assist  you  both.  The  mighty  Asuras 
and  exceedingly  energetic  monkeys  as  also  the  Gandharvas 
with  Shatakratu  at  their  head  or  the  Gods  themselves  would  not 
have  been  able  to  sever  these  formidable  bonds  wrought  with 
arrows,  woven  with  the  aid  of  great  magic  by  Indrajita  of 
ruthless  deeds.  These  offspring  of  Kadru  of  sharp  fangs  and 
subtle  poison,  which  the  potent  arts  of  the  titan  had  changed 
to  arrows,  had  fettered  thee.  Fortunate  art  thou,  O  Virtuous 
Rama,  thou  true  hero,  as  also  Lakshmana,  thy  brother,  the 
destroyer  of  his  foes  in  combat. 

Hearing  of  thy  plight,  summoning  up  mine  energy  in 
affection  for  you  both,  giving  ear  to  the  call  of  friendship  alone, 
I  came  hither  with  all  speed.  Now  that  you  are  liberated  from 
these  formidable  bonds  let  both  of  you  be  constantly  on  your 
guard  !  All  titans  by  nature  have  recourse  to  treachery  in  war, 
whilst  for  you,  O  Chivalrous  Warriors,  honour  is  your  only 
weapon.  Never  trust  the  titans  on  the  battlefield  for  such 
perfidious  means  are  ever  employed  by  them." 

Having  counselled  him  in  this  wise,  the  mighty  Suparna 
embraced  Rama  tenderly  and  craved  his  permission  to  depart, 
saying : — 

"  Dear  and  Virtuous  Raghava,  thou  art  a  friend  to  thy  foes, 
allow  me  to  take  my  leave.  Do  not  enquire  indiscreetly  into  the 
cause  of  my  friendship,  O  Raghava,  who  am  as  near  to  thee  as 
thy  breath,  though  external  to  thee.  Thou  sbalt  know  of  it  when 
thou  hast  achieved  success  in  battle,  O  Hero !  When,  under  the 
rain  of  thy  missiles,  Lanka  has  been  destroyed  save  for  the  aged 
124 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

and  the  children  and  thou  hast  slain  Ravana,  thine  adversary, 
thou  shalt  bring  back  Sita  !  " 

Having  said  this,  Suparna  of  swift  flight,  who  had  just  healed 
Rama's  wounds  in  the  presence  of  the  monkeys,  having  paid 
obeisance  to  him  and  taken  him  into  his  arms,  mounted  into 
the  sky  with  the  speed  of  the  wind. 

Seeing  the  two  Raghavas  healed  of  their  wounds,  the  leaders 
of  the  monkeys,  lashing  their  tails,  roared  like  lions.  Thereafter 
gongs  were  beaten  and  drums  resounded,  whilst  conches  were 
blown  amidst  general  rejoicing.  Some  manifested  their  strength 
by  breaking  down  the  trees  which  they  used  as  maces  and,  in  their 
warlike  frenzy,  those  Plavamgamas  hurled  themselves  on  the 
gates  of  Lanka. 

Thereafter  a  terrible  and  appalling  clamour  arose  amongst  the 
foremost  of  monkeys  as,  at  the  end  of  summer,  the  roaring  of 
thunderclouds  in  the  night. 


CHAPTER    5  I 

Dhumraksha  goes  out  to  fight  the  Monkeys 

That  formidable  clamour,  set  up  by  the  monkeys  who  were 
full  of  martial  ardour,  arrested  the  attention  of  Ravana  and  his 
titans,  and  he,  hearing  the  joyful  and  spirited  acclamations  and 
the  distant  tumult,  said  to  his  ministers  who  surrounded  him : — 

"  A  great  uproar,  resembling  the  muttering  of  clouds,  has 
arisen  from  that  horde  of  delighted  monkeys.  Undoubtedly 
their  joy  is  great,  their  mighty  shouts  are  agitating  the  ocean 
itself.  Nevertheless  whetted  shafts  have  rendered  the  two 
brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  insensible,  therefore  this 
tremendous  outcry  almost  alarms  me !  " 

Having  spoken  thus  to  his  ministers,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans 
said  to  his  Nairritas,  who  stood  round  him : — 

"  Do  ye  speedily  discover  from  what  cause  this  general 
rejoicing  among  those  forest  dwellers  proceeds  in  their  present 
painful  situation  !  " 

At  this  command,  the  titans  hastily  climbed  the  ramparts 
125 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

from  where  they  beheld  the  army  and  its  leader  the  illustrious 
Sugriva  with  the  two  Raghavas  also,  freed  of  their  bonds,  seated 
in  noble  ease,  whereupon  the  titans  were  thunderstruck.  With 
terror  in  their  hearts,  those  fierce  warriors  jumped  down  from 
the  walls  and,  deadly  pale,  returned  to  their  king.  With 
downcast  mien,  those  titans,  skilled  in  speech,  faithfully 
informed  Ravana  of  those  unpleasant  tidings,  saying  : — 

"  The  two  brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  whom  Indrajita 
had  bound  with  his  benumbing  shafts  and  whose  arms  he  had 
pinioned,  are  freed  from  the  arrows  which  paralysed  them  and 
now  appear  on  the  field  of  battle  in  theirnative  vigour,  resembling 
two  elephants  who  have  snapped  their  fetters." 

At  these  words,  the  powerful  King  of  the  Titans,  full  of 
anxiety  and  highly  incensed,  grew  pale  and  said : — 

"  If  mine  adversaries,  having  thus  been  bound,  are  now  free 
despite  those  formidable  arrows,  those  rare  boons  resembling 
serpents  bright  as  the  sun,  that  were  infallible  and  with  which 
Indrajita  secured  them  after  overcoming  them  in  combat,  then 
mine  entire  authority  is  in  jeopardy !  Verily  those  darts,  bright 
as  fire,  which  in  battle  deprived  mine  enemies  of  life  have  been 
rendered  void." 

Having  uttered  these  words  in  furious  tones,  hissing  like  a 
snake,  he  addressed  one  named  Dhumraksha  who  was  seated 
amidst  the  titans  and  said : — 

"  Taking  with  thee  a  considerable  force  of  titans  go  without 
delay  and  slay  Rama  and  Lakshmana." 

At  the  command  of  that  crafty  monarch,  Dhumraksha 
circumambulated  him  and  immediately  left  the  palace,  thereafter 
having  crossed  the  threshold  he  said  to  the  General  of  the  Forces: 

"  Mobilize  the  army,  what  need  is  there  for  delay  when  the 
battle  is  joined !  " 

Thus  spoke  Dhumraksha  and  the  General  gathered  together 
a  large  number  of  troops  in  accord  with  Ravana's  command. 

Thereafter  those  prowlers  of  the  night,  who  were  valiant 
and  of  a  formidable  aspect,  with  girdles  of  bells  round 
their  waists,  shouted  exultantly  and  ranged  themselves  round 
Dhumraksha. 

Furnished  with  every  kind  of  weapon,  brandishing  spears, 
hammers,  maces,  harpoons,  sticks,  iron  cudgels,  bars,  hooks, 
126 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

picks,  nooses  and  axes,  those  terrible  titans  sallied  forth  with  the 
noise  of  thunder.  Clad  in  mail  and  mounted  on  chariots  that 
were  magnificently  dressed  with  flags  and  decorated  with  bands 
of  pure  gold,  harnessed  to  mules  of  many  heads  or  steeds  of 
exceeding  fleetness  or  elephants  maddened  with  Mada  juice, 
some  of  those  titans  bounded  forward  like  veritable  tigers. 

And  Dhumraksha,  with  a  great  clatter  set  out  in  a  celestial 
car  to  which  mules  with  golden  harness  and  the  heads  of  deer 
and  lions  were  hitched ;  and  that  valiant  general  surrounded  by 
the  titans  set  forth  amidst  mocking  laughter  through  the 
western  gate,  where  Hanuman  was  stationed.  As  he  advanced 
in  his  excellent  car  harnessed  to  mules,  whose  voices  he  emulated, 
birds  of  ill-omen  planed  above  him  and  on  the  top  of  his  chariot 
a  terrible  vulture  alighted  while  those  devourers  of  corpses 
clustered  on  the  point  of  his  standard.  Streaming  with  blood 
a  huge  decapitated  and  livid  trunk  fell  to  earth  emitting  in- 
articulate cries  at  Dhumraksha's  approach  and  the  sky  rained 
down  blood,  the  earth  shook,  the  wind  blew  adversely  with  the 
roar  of  thunder  and  darkness  obscured  every  quarter. 

Beholding  those  terrible  portents  that  appeared  in  all  their 
horror,  boding  ill-fortune  to  the  titans,  Dhumraksha  was  filled 
with  alarm,  and  terror  seized  all  the  soldiers  who  accompanied 
him.  At  the  moment  when,  full  of  fear,  amidst  his  coundess 
titans,  eager  to  enter  into  combat,  that  valiant  general  set  out, 
he  beheld  the  vast  army  of  the  monkeys  resembling  a  great 
flood,  protected  by  the  arms  of  the  Raghavas. 


chapter  52 

Dhumraksha  Jights   and   is    slain    by    Hanuman 

Seeing  Dhumraksha  of  redoubtable  courage  set  forth,  all  the 
monkeys  in  their  martial  ardour  emitted  loud  cries  and  a  terrific 
struggle  ensued  between  those  forest  dwellers  and  the  titans, 
who  attacked  each  other  with  huge  trees,  spears  and  maces. 

On  all  sides  ferocious  monkeys  were  massacred  by  titans  and 
titans  felled  to  the  earth  by  monkeys  employing  trees.    The 
"7 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

titans  struck  their  opponents  with  pointed  arrows  furnished 
with  heron's  plumes,  fearful  to  behold,  which  never  missed 
their  target  and  terrible  maces,  harpoons,  axes,  formidable  bars 
and  tridents  of  all  kinds,  which,  brandished  by  them,  mutilated 
those  powerful  monkeys,  while  they,  exasperated,  redoubled 
their  efforts  and,  without  flagging,  continued  the  fight.  Their 
limbs  pierced  with  arrows,  their  bodies  transfixed  with  spears, 
those  foremost  of  the  monkeys  armed  themselves  with  trees 
and  rocks  and,  with  terrific  bounds,  having  proclaimed  their 
names  to  the  accompaniment  of  yells,  crushed  those  intrepid 
titans. 

Thereafter  the  battle  waxed  exceedingly  furious  between 
monkeys  and  demons  and  the  former  amidst  shouts  of  triumph 
seized  hold  of  stones  of  every  kind  and  trees  with  countless 
branches  and  rocks  in  order  to  destroy  the  enemy ;  the  titans, 
who  fed  on  gore,  fell  in  heaps,  vomiting  blood,  their  sides 
slashed  open  by  the  trees,  whilst  others  were  crushed  by  the 
stones  and  yet  others  torn  to  pieces  by  the  monkeys'  teeth. 

Their  standards  broken,  their  swords  snapped,  their  chariots 
overturned,  they  wandered  about  blindly  and  the  earth  was 
covered  with  the  corpses  of  great  elephants  resembling  hills  and 
horses  with  their  riders  crushed  by  the  great  rocks  hurled  on 
them  by  those  dwellers  in  the  woods ;  and  the  monkeys  of 
exceeding  valour  rushed  on  the  titans,  flinging  themselves  upon 
them  with  gTeat  bounds  and  scratching  their  races  with  their 
sharp  nails. 

Mutilated,  their  hair  torn  out,  maddened  by  the  smell  of 
blood,  the  titans  fell  in  great  numbers ;  some  of  those  fierce 
warriors  however,  in  a  paroxysm  of  fury  hurled  themselves 
on  the  monkeys  and  struck  them  with  the  palms  of  their  hands, 
which  resounded  like  the  clap  of  thunder,  and  the  monkeys, 
receiving  that  sharp  shock,  with  an  even  greater  ferocity  crushed 
the  titans  with  blows  of  their  feet,  teeth  and  trees. 

Seeing  his  army  routed,  Dhumraksha,  that  Hon  among  the 
titans,  in  his  rage,  began  to  create  carnage  among  those  bellicose 
apes  and  some  pierced  with  spears  lost  rivers  of  blood  whilst 
others,  struck  down  by  the  blows  of  the  axe,  fell  to  earth. 

Here  some  were  crushed  by  iron  bars,  others  torn  by  harpoons 
or  pierced  by  javelins,  stumbled  and  fell,  yielding  up  their  vital 

138 


YUDDHA     KANDA 

breaths.  Mowed  down,  covered  with  blood,  put  to  flight, 
those  inhabitants  of  the  woods  fell  dying  under  the  furious 
onslaught  of  the  titans  in  the  struggle.  Their  breasts  torn  open 
they  lay  on  their  side  or,  slashed  with  tridents,  their  entrails 
gushed  forth. 

Then  that  mighty  conflict  took  on  fearful  proportions  by 
virtue  of  the  number  of  monkeys  and  titans  who  took  part  and 
the  innumerable  darts,  stones  and  trees  that  were  used.  With 
the  bowstrings  as  the  tuneful  lute,  the  neighing  of  the  horses, 
the  clapping  of  the  hands  and  the  trumpeting  of  the  elephants 
as  the  melody,  the  whole  battle  resembled  a  symphony. 

Meanwhile  Dhumraksha,  armed  with  his  bow,  in  the  forefront 
of  battle,  under  a  hail  of  missiles,  dispersed  the  monkeys  as  in 
sport  on  every  side,  and  Maruti,  beholding  the  monkey  army 
being  exterminated  and  put  to  flight  by  that  titan,  hurled  himself 
upon  him  in  fury,  a  great  rock  in  his  hand.  His  eyes  inflamed 
with  anger,  the  equal  of  his  sire  in  courage,  he  flung  the  rock  on 
the  chariot  of  his  foe  and  seeing  the  stone  fall,  Dhumraksha, 
brandishing  his  mace,  in  his  agitation  leapt  quickly  from  the 
car  to  the  ground.  Then  that  rock  rolled  on  the  earth,  having 
shattered  the  chariot  with  its  wheels,  its  pole,  its  shafts,  banner 
and  Dhumraksha's  bow. 

Thereafter  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta,  leaving  the  car  lying, 
slew  the  titans  with  die  trunks  of  trees  furnished  with  their 
branches,  and  their  heads  crushed,  covered  with  blood,  mangled 
by  those  trees,  they  fell  to  the  earth. 

Having  routed  the  army  of  the  enemy,  Hanuman,  born  of 
Maruta,  breaking  off  the  peak  of  a  mountain  hurled  himself  on 
Dhumraksha,  who,  brandishing  his  mace,  rushed  on  his 
adversary  and  he  advanced  with  haste  towards  him  shouting. 
Then  Dhumraksha,  in  his  rage,  brought  down  that  weapon 
studded  with  countless  points  on  the  head  of  the  infuriated 
Hanuman  and  assailed  by  that  violent  and  fearful  stroke,  the 
monkey,  who  was  endowed  with  the  strength  of  Maruta,  was 
in  no  wise  disturbed  but  struck  the  titan  full  on  the  skull  with 
his  rocky  peak  which  shattered  all  his  limbs,  whereupon 
Dhumraksha  suddenly  fell  to  the  earth  like  a  mountain 
crumbling. 

Beholding  him  slain,  the  night-rangers  who  had  survived  the 

129 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

slaughter,    terrified,    re-entered    Lanka,    harassed    by    the 
Plavamgamas. 

The  Illustrious  son  of  Pavana,  however,  having  destroyed 
his  enemies,  causing  rivers  of  blood  to  flow,  weary  of  slaughter, 
with  delight  received  the  cordial  felicitations  of  the  monkey 
leaders. 


chapter  53 

Vajradamshtra  enters  the  Lists 

Hearing  of  the  death  of  Dhumraksha,  Ravana  the  King  of  the 
Titans  fell  into  a  transport  of  fury  and  began  to  hiss  like  a 
serpent.  Wrought  up  with  ire,  with  long  and  burning  sighs 
he  addressed  the  exceedingly  powerful  Vajradamshtra,  saying : — 

"  O  Warrior,  go  forth  at  the  head  of  the  titans  and  triumph 
over  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  Rama,  as  also  over  Sugriva  and  the 
monkeys ! " 

"  Be  it  so !  "  answered  the  general  who  was  versed  in  the  art 
of  magic,  and  he  departed  speedily  with  the  innumerable 
divisions  that  surrounded  him. 

With  the  utmost  care  he  assembled  teams  of  elephants,  horses, 
donkeys  and  mules,  adorning  them  with  countless  flags  of 
different  colours,  and  that  titan,  wearing  bracelets  and  a  diadem 
of  great  price,  set  out  immediately,  bearing  his  bow  and,  having 
circumambulated  his  chariot  dressed  with  pennants,  which 
dazzled  the  gaze  with  its  facings  of  pure  gold,  he  ascended  it. 

Thereafter  infantry  of  every  kind  issued  forth,  furnished  with 
weapons,  such  as  cutlasses,  innumerable  darts,  gleaming  maces, 
harpoons,  bows,  lances,  spears,  swords,  discus,  hammers  and 
sharp  axes.  All  those  illustrious  lions  among  the  titans  in  their 
resplendent  and  many-coloured  uniforms,  full  of  ardour 
mounted  on  elephants  intoxicated  with  ichor,  resembled 
moving  hills.  Their  mounts  equipped  for  combat,  driven  by 
mahouts  bearing  lances  and  goads,  were  headed  by  those 
distinguished  for  their  trappings  and  great  strength. 

And  the  whole  army  of  titans  filed  out,  looking  as  brilliant 
as  the  clouds  riven  by  lightning  in  the  rainy  season  and  they 
130 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

emerged  from  the  northern  gate  where  the  General  Angada  was 
stationed. 

Thereafter,  as  they  set  forth,  fearful  portents  appeared  and, 
from  a  cloudless  yet  burning  sky,  meteors  fell  while  jackals, 
emitting  fearful  howls,  belched  forth  flames  and  fire.  Hideous 
beasts  foretold  the  destruction  of  the  titans  who  entered  into  the 
combat  stumbling  miserably. 

Yet  despite  those  ill-omens,  the  mighty  Vajradamshtra,  full 
of  energy  and  prowess,  went  forward  eager  to  meet  the  foe  and, 
seeing  their  adversaries  advancing,  the  monkeys,  burning  for 
victory,  set  up  tremendous  shouts  which  echoed  in  every  quarter. 

Thereafter  a  furious  struggle  ensued  between  the  monkeys  and 
the  titans  and  those  redoubtable  warriors  of  ferocious  aspect 
sought  to  bring  about  each  other's  destruction.  Some  of  those 
warriors,  their  heads  and  bodies  severed,  fell  to  the  earth  bathed 
in  blood,  whilst  others,  whose  arms  resembled  steel,  approached 
one  another,  attacking  with  various  weapons,  neither  giving 
ground.  Trees,  stones  and  javelins  clashed  with  a  tremendous 
noise,  striking  terror  in  the  heart  of  the  listeners  and  the  appalling 
clatter  of  chariot  wheels,  the  twanging  of  bow-strings,  the  blare 
of  trumpets,  the  roll  of  drums,  the  booming  of  gongs,  created  an 
indescribable  uproar. 

Then,  throwing  away  their  weapons,  they  wrestled  with 
one  another  in  hand-to-hand  combat,  striking  each  other  with 
the  palms  of  their  hands,  their  feet,  their  knees  and  even  with 
trees.  Some  of  the  titans  had  their  bodies  torn  open,  some  were 
crushed  by  rocks  and  some  were  beaten  down  by  the  blows  of 
the  monkeys  in  the  fight. 

Now  Vajradamshtra,  having  surveyed  the  scene,  began  to  sow 
terror  among  the  monkeys,  as  Antaka,  noose  in  hand,  at  the 
destruction  of  the  worlds. 

Full  of  vigour,  those  skilled  warriors,  the  titans,  transported 
with  rage,  decimated  the  monkey  forces  with  every  kind  of 
weapon  and,  on  his  side  the  audacious  son  of  Vayu  struck 
down  all  those  titans  in  the  fight,  fury  re-doubling  his  strength, 
so  that  he  appeared  like  the  Fire  of  Dissolution.  Then  the 
valiant  Angada,  the  equal  of  Shakra  in  valour,  brandishing  a 
tree,  his  eyes  red  with  anger,  like  a  lion  amidst  defenceless  deer, 
caused  a  terrible  carnage.  By  the  force  of  his  blows,  the  titans 
131 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  redoubtable  courage,  their  skulls  crushed,  fell  like  trees 
under  the  blows  of  the  axe  and  the  earth,  strewn  with  chariots 
of  every  kind,  standards,  horses,  bodies  of  monkeys  and  titans 
and  rivers  of  blood,  was  fearful  to  behold.  Strings  of  pearls, 
bracelets,  raiment,  and  parasols  decorated  the  battlefield,  which 
glowed  like  an  autumnal  night  and  the  tempestuous  Angada 
scattered  the  great  army  of  the  titans  as  the  wind  dispels  the 
clouds. 


chapter  54 

Angada  slays  Vajradamshtra 

The  extermination  of  his  army  through  Angada' s  prowess  filled 
the  valiant  Vajradamshtra  with  fury.  Stretching  his  formidable 
bow,  like  unto  Shakra's  thunderbolt,  he  assailed  the  monkey 
battalions  with  a  hail  of  shafts  whereupon  the  foremost  of  the 
titans  mounted  on  chariots,  armed  with  every  kind  of  weapon 
and  full  of  courage,  entered  the  lists  whilst  the  monkeys,  those 
powerful  bulls  among  the  Plavagas,  assembling  on  all  sides, 
fought  with  rocks. 

Thousands  of  weapons  were  hurled  in  that  desperate  encounter 
by  the  titan  and  monkey  leaders  and,  from  their  side,  the  great 
monkeys  with  the  ardour  of  elephants  in  rut,  showered  down 
giant  trees  and  huge  lumps  of  rock  on  the  demons  so  that  between 
those  intrepid  warriors,  the  titans  and  the  monkeys,  who  never 
retreated  in  battle,  a  tremendous  struggle  ensued. 

Monkeys  and  titans,  still  possessing  heads  but  bereft  of  arms 
and  legs,  lay  on  the  earth  bathed  in  blood  and  bristling  with 
arrows,  a  prey  to  herons,  vultures  and  crows  or  devoured  by 
troops  of  jackals. 

Monkeys  and  night-rangers  fell  on  the  battlefield ;  headless 
trunks  leapt  up  to  the  terror  of  all,  their  arms,  hands  and  heads 
severed  and  their  limbs  hacked  to  pieces  in  the  fight. 

Meanwhile  the  army  of  Vajradamshtra,  overcome  by  the 

monkeys,  broke  up  under  his  eyes,  whereupon  that  leader,  seeing 

the  titans  terrorised  and  decimated  by  the  Plavamgamas,  his 

eyes  red  with  anger,  bow  in  hand,  penetrated  the  enemy  ranks, 

13a 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

sowing  panic  amongst  them.  Thereafter  he  dispatched  those 
monkeys  with  arrows  furnished  with  heron's  plumes  that  flew 
straight  to  their  target  and  pierced  seven,  eight,  nine  or  five 
of  his  opponents  simultaneously,  thus  destroying  them  in  his 
fury.  Put  to  flight,  those  simian  battalions,  their  limbs  crippled 
by  those  darts,  sought  refuge  with  Angada  as  all  creatures  with 
Prajapati ;  and  when  he  beheld  those  monkey  divisions  fleeing 
in  disorder,  the  son  of  Bali  exchanged  glances  of  hatred  with 
Vajradamshtra  and,  in  a  paroxysm  of  rage,  they  entered  into  a 
terrible  duel  one  with  the  other  so  that  it  seemed  a  Hon  and  an 
elephant  intoxicated  with  ichor  fought  together.  And  the  son 
of  Bali  full  of  valour,  was  struck  in  his  vital  parts  by  a  hundred 
thousand  arrows  resembling  tongues  of  fire  and  all  his  limbs  were 
besprinkled  with  blood.  Then  that  exceedingly  energetic 
monkey  of  redoubtable  courage  hurled  a  tree  at  Vajradamshtra 
but  that  intrepid  titan,  seeing  it  fall,  cut  it  into  innumerable 
pieces  which  fell  in  heaps  on  the  earth. 

Witnessing  the  strength  of  his  rival,  that  lion  among  the 
Plavagas  seized  hold  of  a  huge  rock  which  he  spun  round, 
emitting  a  shout  and,  as  it  descended,  that  hero  leaping  down 
from  his  chariot,  armed  with  his  mace,  stood  waiting  un- 
perturbed. Meanwhile  that  rock  discharged  by  Angada  fell 
on  the  forefront  of  the  battle  where  it  shattered  the  chariot  with 
its  wheels,  shafts  and  horses. 

Then  the  monkey  broke  off  a  great  crag  from  the  mountain 
once  more  and  it  was  covered  with  trees  and  he  brought  it  down 
on  the  head  of  his  adversary  so  that  Vajradamshtra,  seized  with 
a  sudden  giddiness,  faltered  and  began  to  vomit  blood,  clenching 
his  mace  convulsively  and  breathing  heavily.  Thereafter, 
coming  to  his  senses,  in  a  transport  of  fury  he  hit  the  son  of 
Bali  full  on  the  chest  with  his  mace  and,  letting  it  fall,  began  to 
fight  with  his  fists  whereupon  a  hand-to-hand  struggle  ensued 
between  monkey  and  titan.  Exhausted  by  the  blows,  spitting 
blood,  those  valiant  warriors  resembled  the  planets  Mars  and 
Mercury. 

Meanwhile  the  exceedingly  powerful  Angada,  that  lion  of 
Plavagas  stood  waiting  and  he  seized  hold  of  a  shield  covered 
with  the  hide  of  a  bull  and  a  great  sword  decorated  with  golden 
bells  enveloped  in  a  leathern  sheath. 

«  133 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

In  the  midst  of  innumerable  graceful  evolutions,  the  monkey 
and  the  titan  attacked  each  other,  roaring  and  thirsting  for  victory. 
With  their  gaping  wounds,  they  shone  like  two  Kimshuka  Trees 
in  flower  and  the  straggle  robbed  them  of  their  breath  so  that 
they  sank  to  their  knees  on  the  earth.  Thereafter  in  the 
twinkling  of  an  eye,  Angada,  that  elephant  among  monkeys, 
rose  up,  his  eyes  inflamed  like  a  serpent  that  has  been  struck 
with  a  stick  and,  with  his  stainless  sword  that  was  well  sharpened, 
the  son  of  Bali  who  was  full  of  vigour,  struck  off  the  huge  head 
of  Vajradamshtra,  whose  limbs  were  bathed  in  blood.  Under 
the  stroke  of  that  sword,  his  beautiful  head  fell,  cleft  in  twain, 
the  eyes  rolling. 

Beholding  Vajradamshtra  slain,  the  titans,  wild  with  terror, 
tied  panic-stricken  towards  Lanka,  harassed  by  the  Plavamgamas, 
their  faces  woe-begone,  their  heads  bowed  in  shame. 

Having  struck  down  the  enemy  with  his  powerful  arm,  the 
mighty  son  of  Bali  experienced  great  joy  amidst  the  monkey 
army,  honoured  by  them  for  his  high  courage  and  he  resembled 
the  God  of  a  Thousand  Eyes  surrounded  by  the  Celestials. 


chapter  55 

Akampana  goes  out  to  fight  against  the  Monkeys 

HEARING  that  Vajradamshtra  had  been  slain  by  the  son  of  Bali, 
Ravana  addressed  the  General  of  his  forces  who,  with  joined 
palms,  stood  near  him  and  said  : — 

"  Let  the  invincible  titans  of  irresistible  courage  go  forth 
immediately  with  Akampana  at  their  head,  who  is  conversant 
with  the  use  of  every  weapon  and  missile;  he  excels  in  vanquishing 
the  foe  and  in  preserving  and  leading  his  own  forces ;  he  has 
ever  desired  my  welfare  and  loved  war ;  he  will  prove  victorious 
over  the  two  Kakutsthas  and  the  exceedingly  energetic  Sugriva. 
The  rest  of  the  monkeys  too  are  formidable  but  without  doubt 
he  will  exterminate  them  all." 

At  this  command  from  Ravana,  the  valiant  titan,  in  great  haste, 
mobilized  an  entire  division  of  the  army.    Furnished  with  every 

*34 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

kind  of  weapon,  those  foremost  of  titans  of  terrifying  aspect, 
fearful  to  look  upon,  rushed  into  the  fray  where  their  general 
had  despatched  them. 

Akampana  of  the  stature  and  colour  of  a  cloud,  whose  voice 
resembled  thunder,  ascended  his  car  decorated  with  fine  gold 
and  set  out  surrounded  by  dreadful  demons.  He,  who  was 
incapable  of  trembling  in  battle  even  before  the  Gods  themselves, 
seemed  to  the  monkeys  to  be  as  splendid  as  the  sun.  As  he 
sped  on  his  way,  furious  and  eager  to  enter  into  combat,  the 
horses  drawing  his  chariot  were  suddenly  deprived  of  their 
energy  and  the  left  eye  of  that  one  who  delighted  in  warfare  began 
to  twitch.  His  countenance  grew  pale,  his  voice  trembled,  the 
day  which  had  seemed  so  fair  became  threatening  and  a  bitter 
wind  began  to  blow.  Birds  and  beasts  uttered  mournful  cries 
but  that  titan,  who  had  the  shoulders  of  a  lion  and  the  agility 
of  a  tiger,  disregarding  those  portents,  rushed  towards  the 
battlefield  and,  as  he  went  forward  with  his  troops,  an  immense 
tumult  arose  that  seemed  to  convulse  the  ocean  and  the  sound 
appalled  the  simian  army,  who,  furnished  with  trees,  prepared  to 
enter  into  combat. 

Thereafter  a  fearful  struggle  ensued  between  monkeys  and 
demons  and,  ready  to  sacrifice  their  lives  in  the  cause  of  Rama 
and  Ravana,  those  monkey  and  titan  warriors  of  exceeding 
valour,  who  resembled  hills,  contended  with  each  other  and, 
the  yells  they  emitted  in  the  thick  of  the  fight  and  the  shouts  of 
defiance  that  they  let  forth  in  their  rage  created  an  indescribable 
clamour.  A  thick  coppery  dust,  raised  by  the  monkeys  and 
the  titans  enveloped  the  whole  horizon  and,  in  the  midst  of  that 
yellow  cloud  resembling  silk  which  covered  them,  the  combatants 
could  no  longer  distinguish  each  other  on  the  field.  Neither 
standard,  banner,  shield,  weapon  nor  chariot  could  be  discerned 
in  that  pall  of  dust  and  the  terrific  clamour  of  warriors  challenging 
and  rushing  upon  each  other  was  appalling  to  hear,  yet  in  the 
confusion  no  form  was  visible. 

In  that  fight  monkeys  fell  under  the  blows  of  enraged  monkeys, 
titans  massacred  titans  in  the  darkness ;  Plavagas  and  demons 
slew  foe  and  friend,  and  the  earth  drenched  with  gore  was  thick 
with  mud. 

Under  the  rain  of  blood  the  dust  was  laid,  revealing  the 

*35 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

earth  covered  with  corpses.  Then  the  monkeys  and  titans 
assailed  each  other  with  blows  from  trees,  spears,  maces, 
javelins,  stones,  bars  and  picks,  wrestling  with  their  adversaries 
who  resembled  mountains.  In  that  encounter  those  monkeys 
slew  the  titans  of  dreadful  deeds  and  they,  transported  with  rage, 
bearing  darts  and  javelins  in  their  hands,  destroyed  the  monkeys 
with  their  cruel  weapons. 

Thereafter  Akampana,  the  leader  of  the  titans,  full  of  ire, 
consoled  all  those  fierce  and  valiant  soldiers ;  the  monkeys 
however,  leaping  upon  them,  shattered  their  weapons  and 
crushed  those  titans  with  blows  from  trees  and  stones. 

At  that  instant,  the  courageous  monkey  Leaders,  Kumuda, 
Nala  and  Mainda,  in  a  paroxysm  of  rage,  as  in  sport,  with 
mighty  bounds  and  blows  of  trees  created  a  great  carnage 
amongst  the  titans  and  all  those  lions  among  the  monkeys 
brought  about  complete  disorder  in  the  enemy  ranks  with 
their    countless  missiles. 


CHAPTER    56 

Akampana    is    slain    by    Hanuman 

Witnessing  this  great  exploit  executed  by  the  monkey  leaders, 
Akampana  was  seized  with  violent  anger  and  his  features 
became  distorted.  Brandishing  his  powerful  bow,  he  addressed 
his  charioteer  in  these  words  : — 

"  Drive  the  chariot  with  all  speed  to  that  place,  for  those 
warriors  axe  slaying  countless  titans  on  the  battlefield.  Those 
arrogant  monkeys  of  exceeding  ferocity,  armed  with  trees  and 
rocks,  dare  to  affront  me  !  I  shall  exterminate  those  audacious 
warriors  who  are  seen  sowing  confusion  in  the  ranks  of  the 
titans! " 

Thereupon,  in  his  chariot  drawn  by  fast-moving  horses, 

Akampana,  the  most  skilful  of  car-warriors,  with  a  hail  of  darts, 

overwhelmed  the  monkeys  so  that  they  were  no  longer  able  to 

maintain  their  formation  nor  for  this  reason  could  they  fight 

136 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

and,  crushed  under  die  shafts  of  the  than,  the  confusion  became 
general. 

Then  the  valiant  Hanuman,  seeing  them  fell  under  the  sway 
of  death,  pursued  by  Akampana's  darts,  went  to  the  rescue  of  his 
companions  and,  beholding  that  great  Plavaga,  those  lions 
among  the  monkeys  rallied  and,  in  the  field,  grouped  themselves 
boldly  round  him.  Observing  his  courage,  those  foremost  of 
the  monkeys  took  heart  in  the  shelter  of  his  valour. 

Meanwhile  Akampana,  like  unto  a  second  Mahendra,  caused 
a  hail  of  arrows  to  descend  on  Hanuman  who  remained  as  firm 
as  a  rock,  heedless  of  the  weapons  that  fell  upon  his  body,  and 
that  exceedingly  courageous  monkey  resolved  to  slay  his 
adversary  and,  with  peals  of  laughter,  the  impetuous  son  of 
Maruta  leapt  on  the  titan,  causing  the  earth  to  shake  as  it  were, 
while  burning  with  energy  he  emitted  yells,  so  that  it  was 
impossible  to  look  upon  him  as  it  is  impossible  to  gaze  on  a  fire 
in  a  brazier. 

Finding  himself  without  weapons,  that  foremost  one  among 
the  monkeys,  in  the  fury  that  possessed  him,  tore  up  a  rock  and 
seizing  a  huge  crag  with  one  hand,  Maruti,  letting  forth  a  roar, 
began  to  spin  it  rapidly  thereafter  hurling  it  at  the  Titan  Leader 
Akampana,  as  formerly  in  the  encounter,  Purandara  hurled  his 
thunderbolt  at  Namuchi. 

Akampana,  however,  seeing  that  crag  flying  towards  him, 
shattered  it  from  a  distance  by  means  of  great  crescent-shaped 
darts.  Beholding  that  rocky  peak  shattered  in  the  air  by  the 
titan's  arrows  and  falling  in  pieces,  Hanuman  became  mad  with 
anger  and  observing  an  Ashvakarna  Tree  as  large  as  a  mountain, 
in  the  transport  of  rage  that  possessed  him,  that  monkey  uprooted 
it  with  violence  and  taking  hold  of  that  tree  of  immense  branches, 
in  his  great  strength,  brandished  it  exultantly.  Then  he  began 
to  run  with  great  strides,  breaking  down  the  trees  in  his  haste 
and,  in  the  excess  of  his  fury,  tearing  up  the  earth  with  his  feet; 
and  he  struck  down  elephants  as  also  those  who  rode  upon  them 
and  charioteers  with  their  cars  and  the  formidable  titan 
infantry. 

Seeing  Hanuman,  like  unto  Antaka,  the  Destroyer  of  Vital 
Breaths,  full  of  wrath,  armed  with  a  tree,  the  titans  took  to  flight. 
Thereupon  the  valiant  Akampana  beholding  that  enraged  monkey 
137 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

sowing  terror  amongst  his  soldiers,  greatly  perturbed,  set  up  a 
mighty  shout  and,  with  fourteen  pointed  arrows  that  tore  the 
flesh,  he  pierced  the  exceedingly  powerful  Hanuman. 

Riddled  with  sharp-pointed  iron  shafts,  that  simian  warrior 
resembled  a  mountain  covered  with  forests  and,  like  unto  a 
flowering  Ashoka  Tree,  he  shone  like  a  smokeless  flame.  Up- 
rooting another  tree,  with  a  prodigious  bound  he  struck  the 
head  of  the  Titan  General  a  fearful  blow  and,  by  that  stroke  with 
which  that  Indra  among  Monkeys  smote  him  in  his  fury, 
Akampana  fell  dead. 

Seeing  their  leader  lying  lifeless  on  the  earth,  all  the  titans 
trembled  as  trees  when  the  earth  quakes.  Put  to  flight,  all  those 
warriors,  throwing  away  their  arms,  escaped  in  the  direction  of 
Lanka,  terrified,  pursued  by  the  monkeys.  Their  hair  loosened, 
panic-stricken,  their  pride  broken  by  defeat,  their  limbs  dripping 
with  sweat,  in  their  bewilderment,  they  fled  in  confusion. 
Thereafter,  mad  with  fear,  looking  back  continually,  crushing 
each  other  in  their  haste,  they  entered  the  city. 

And  when  those  titans  had  entered  Lanka,  those  exceedingly 
powerful  monkeys  surrounded  Hanuman  in  order  to  pay 
homage  to  him  and  the  mighty  Hanuman,  of  noble  nature, 
honoured  them  all  in  accord  with  their  rank. 

Then  the  triumphant  monkeys  shouted  with  might  and  main 
and  once  more  pursued  the  titans  with  the  intention  of  slaying 
them  while  that  great  Plavaga,  born  of  Maruta,  returning  to  his 
own  companions,  having  slain  the  titan,  enjoyed  the  same 
renown  in  battle  as  Vishnu  when  he  overcame  the  mighty  Asura 
of  immense  power  in  the  forefront  of  the  fight. 

Thereafter  that  monkey  received  the  homage  of  the  Gods  and 
of  Rama  himself  as  also  that  of  the  exceedingly  valiant  Lakshmana 
and  the  Plavamgamas  led  by  Sugriva  and  the  great-souled 
Bibishana.

CHAPTER    57 

Prahasta  goes  out  to  fight 

Hearing  of  Akampana's  death,  the  irascible  Lord  of  the  Titans 
with  a  downcast  mien,  took  counsel  with  his  ministers  and, 
having  reflected  awhile  and  deliberated  with  them,  Ravana, 
the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  passed  the  forenoon  in  inspecting  the 
defences ;  and  the  King  passed  through  that  city,  decorated 
with  banners  and  flags,  guarded  by  the  titans  and  filled  with 
innumerable  troops. 

Seeing  Lanka  beseiged,  Ravana,  the  Sovereign  of  the  Titans, 
said  to  the  devoted  Prahasta,  a  skilled  soldier : — 

"  This  city  thus  beleaguered  and  hard  pressed,  O  Skilful 
Warrior,  may  only  be  delivered  by  myself,  Kumbhakama,  thou, 
who  art  in  command  of  the  army,  Indrajita  or  Nikumbha ; 
none  else  could  undertake  such  a  task  ! 

"  Taking  a  company  of  warriors,  do  thou  speedily  place  thyself 
in  their  midst  and  set  forth  in  order  to  triumph  over  those 
inhabitants  of  the  woods.  In  this  sortie,  as  soon  as  the  army  of 
monkeys  hear  the  uproar  created  by  the  titans,  they  will  disperse. 
Volatile,  undisciplined  and  fickle,  the  monkeys  will  not  be  able 
to  endure  thy  cry,  any  more  than  an  elephant  can  endure  the 
roaring  of  a  lion.  His  army  routed,  Rama  with  Saumitri, 
robbed  of  further  authority,  wul  fall  into  thy  power,  O  Prahasta. 

"A  hypothetical  misfortune  is  preferable  to  one  that  is  certain ! 
Whether  it  be  unpleasing  to  hear  or  no,  say  what  thou  considerest 
to  be  to  our  advantage !  " 

Thus  addressed  by  that  Indra  among  Titans,  Prahasta,  the 
leader  of  the  army,  answered  him  as  Ushanas  the  King  of  the 
Asuras,  saying : — 

"  O  King,  formerly  we  discussed  this  matter  with  the  wise 
and,  after  examining  the  different  points  of  view,  a  disagreement 
arose  between  us.To  return  Sita  was  what  I  considered  the  most 
advantageous  course,  not  to  do  so,  meant  war  ;  we  forsaw  this. 

"  I  have  ever  been  heaped  with  gifts  and  honours  by  thee  as 

also  with  every  mark  of  friendship.    When  the  opportunity 

139 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

arises,  is  it  not  foi  me  to  render  thee  a  service  ?  Nay,  I  shall 
neither  spare  life,  children,  wife  nor  wealth  !  Know  me  to  be 
ready  to  sacrifice  my  life  in  thine  interest  in  battle  I  " 

Having  spoken  thus  to  his  brother,  the  General  Prahasta  said 
to  his  leading  officers  who  stood  before  him  : — 

"  Gather  a  large  army  together  immediately ;  to-day  the 
flesh-eating  birds  and  beasts  shall  feed  on  the  enemy  that  I 
strike  down  on  the  battlefield  with  my  swift  arrows  !  " 

At  this  command  those  highly  powerful  leaders  assembled  the 
forces  in  the  abode  of  the  King  of  the  Titans.  In  an  instant, 
Lanka  was  filled  with  redoubtable  warriors  like  unto  elephants, 
furnished  with  weapons  of  every  kind. 

While  they  propitiated  the  God  who  feeds  on  offerings1  and 
paid  homage  to  the  brahmins,  a  fragrant  breeze,  bearing  the 
scent  of  clarified  butter,  began  to  blow  and  the  titans,  all  ready 
for  battle,  taking  hold  of  garlands  of  every  kind,  adorned 
themselves  with  delight.  Thereafter,  armed  with  bows  and 
mail,  they  set  out  in  their  chariots  at  a  brisk  pace,  their  eyes 
turned  towards  their  King,  Ravana.  And  they  ranged  them- 
selves round  Prahasta  whilst  he  paid  obeisance  to  his  Sovereign 
to  the  beating  of  a  gong  of  dreadful  sound,  whereafter,  with  his 
weapons,  that  general  ascended  his  chariot  that  was  furnished 
with  all  that  was  needful,  harnessed  to  exceedingly  swift  steeds, 
skilfully  driven  and  in  perfect  condition. 

Rumbling  like  a  great  cloud,  shining  like  the  moon  itself, 
unapproachable  as  the  serpent  that  served  as  its  standard, 
solidly  and  artistically  constructed,  decorated  with  a  net  of  pure 
gold,  smiling  as  it  were  in  its  magnificence,  such  was  the  car  in 
which  Prahasta,  having  received  Ravana's  command,  stood. 

Then  the  titan  set  out  from  Lanka  immediately  in  the  midst 
of  a  powerful  army  and,  at  his  departure,  a  rolling  of  drums, 
resembling  the  roar  of  Parjanya,  and  a  blast  of  fanfares  arose  that 
seemed  to  fill  the  earth  and,  with  the  blare  of  conches,  the  titans 
advanced,  creating  a  terrible  uproar. 

Narantaka,  Kumbhahanu,  Mahanada  and  Samunata,  colossal 
giants,  his  adjutants,  surrounded  Prahasta  who  emerged  from 
the  eastern  gate  in  the  midst  of  an  immense,  formidable  and 
powerful  army  resembling  a  herd  of  elephants  and,  in  the  centre 

1  The  Fire-god,  Agnt. 

140 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

of  that  force,  vast  as  the  sea,  Prahasta  in  his  fury  appeared  like 
Death  at  the  end  of  the  world,  whilst  the  uproar,  that  arose  on  his 
setting  forth  with  his  titans  raising  their  war  cries,  drew  a 
sinister  answering  call  from  all  creatures. 

In  a  cloudless  sky,  birds  of  prey  advancing  to  meet  the 
chariot,  circled  from  left  to  right ;  fearful  jackals  vomited  forth 
fire  and  names,  howling  lugubriously ;  a  meteor  fell  from  heaven 
and  the  wind  blew  chill ;  planets,  in  opposition  to  each  other, 
lost  their  brilliance  whilst  clouds  with  a  raucous  sound  showered 
blood  on  Prahasta's  car  with  which  his  attendants  were 
bespattered ;  a  croaking  vulture,  facing  the  south,  alighted  on  the 
top  of  his  standard  depriving  that  titan  of  bis  lustre.  His 
charioteer,  who  never  turned  back  in  battle,  despite  his  skill, 
again  and  again  allowed  the  goad  to  fall  from  his  hand.  The 
brilliance  of  that  sortie  of  incomparable  pomp  vanished  in  an 
instant  and  the  horses  stumbled  on  the  even  ground. 

Beholding  Prahasta,  renowned  for  his  martial  valour, 
advancing  to  give  battle,  the  army  of  monkeys,  furnished  with 
weapons  of  every  kind,  went  forward  to  meet  him  and  a  formid- 
able clamour  arose  amongst  them  as  they  tore  up  the  trees  and 
seized  hold  of  great  rocks. 

Thereafter  the  titans  yelled  and  the  monkeys  roared,  both 
armies  being  filled  with  ardour  and,  in  their  fury  and  zeal  and 
their  impatience  to  slay  each  other,  they  challenged  one  another 
with  tremendous  shouts. 

Meanwhile  Prahasta  advanced  on  the  forces  of  the  monkeys 
whom  in  his  folly  he  imagined  he  would  destroy  and,  with  an 
impetuous  bound,  he  hurled  himself  upon  that  army  as  a 
grasshopper  falls  into  a  flame. 


CHAPTER    58 

The  Death  of  Prahasta 

Beholding  Prahasta  setting  out  with  martial  ardour,  the 
Conqueror  Rama,  smiling,  enquired  of  Bibishana,  saying  : — 
"Who  is  this  colossus  surrounded  by  an  immense  army, 
141 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

who  with  such  speed,  valour  and  courage,  advances  so  swiftly  ? 
Make  known  to  me  this  brave  ranger  of  the  night." 

On  this  enquiry,  Bibishana  answered  : — 

"  Prahasta  is  the  name  of  this  titan  ;  he  is  the  leader  of  the 
army ;  a  third  of  the  forces  belonging  to  the  King  of  the  Titans 
accompanies  him.  He  is  courageous,  a  master  of  the  science 
of  weapons  and  a  warrior  renowned  for  his  prowess-" 

While  the  terrible  Prahasta  of  formidable  exploits  advanced 
roaring,  that  colossus,  surrounded  by  his  troops,  was  observed 
by  the  great  and  powerful  army  of  the  monkeys  who  began  to 
emit  cries  of  defiance. 

Swords,  lances,  daggers,  spears,  darts,  maces,  bludgeons,  bars, 
javelins  and  axes  of  every  kind  with  many  different  bows 
glittered  in  the  hands  of  the  titans  who,  desirous  of  victory, 
fell  upon  the  monkeys. 

Trees  in  flower,  rocks,  huge  and  heavy  stones  were  the  weapons 
of  the  Plavamgamas,  who  were  burning  to  fight  and,  as  they 
approached  each  other,  a  formidable  struggle  arose  between 
those  innumerable  combatants,  who  showered  down  a  hail  of 
stones  and  arrows.  In  the  conflict,  countless  titans  caused  the 
death  of  thousands  of  mighty  monkeys  and  countless  monkeys 
destroyed  as  many  titans.  Some  of  the  combatants  fell  under  the 
lances,  others  under  great  arrows,  some  were  struck  down  by  the 
blows  of  bars,  others  cloven  by  axes.  Deprived  of  their  life's 
breath  they  lay  on  the  earth  their  hearts  transfixed  or  cut  to  pieces 
by  the  avalanche  of  missiles.  And  those  monkeys  fell  on  the  earth 
cut  in  two  by  the  strokes  of  swords,  their  sides  torn  open  by 
those  bold  titans  and  they,  on  their  part,  full  of  fury,  overthrew 
the  enemy  ranks,  heaping  the  earth  with  them,  and  they  struck 
at  them  with  trees  and  crags,  administering  thundering  slaps 
and  terrific  blows  with  their  fists,  so  that  the  titans,  blinded, 
their  faces  ashen,  vomited  blood. 

Thereafter  an  appalling  clamour  arose  and,  amidst  cries  of 
pain  and  leonine  roars,  the  monkeys  and  titans,  each  maddened, 
their  features  distorted,  following  the  path  of  heroes,  conducted 
themselves  with  great  courage.  Narantaka,  Kumbhahanu, 
Mahanada  and  Samunnata,  Prahasta's  companions,  decimated 
those  inhabitants  of  the  woods,  hurling  themselves  on  the 
monkeys  in  rage,  destroying  them ;  and  Dvivida  struck  down 
142 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

one  of  them  named  Narantaka  ;  then  the  ape  Durmukha,  leaping 
up  in  his  turn,  with  a  ready  hand,  struck  Samunnata  with  a 
great  tree;  Jambavan,  in  the  height  of  anger,  seizing  a  huge  stone 
hurled  it  with  force  on  Mahanada's  chest  and,  on  his  side,  the 
valiant  Kumbhahanu,  having  attacked  the  General  Tara,  who 
was  armed  with  a  huge  tree,  received  a  blow  that  cost  him  his 
life. 

Infuriated  by  the  quadruple  murder,  Prahasta,  who  stood  in 
his  chariot,  with  the  bow  held  in  his  hand,  caused  a  dreadful 
havoc  amongst  the  monkeys  and  the  two  armies  became  a  vortex, 
resembling  a  roaring  tempest  over  a  vast  ocean.  In  that  great 
battle,  the  titan,  intoxicated  with  combat,  in  his  fury  annihilated 
the  monkeys  under  an  immense  avalanche  of  arrows.  The 
corpses  of  monkeys  and  titans  heaped  the  ground  and  covered  it 
tike  hideous  mountains  and  the  earth,  running  with  the  blood 
which  inundated  it,  shone  as  in  the  month  of  Spring  when 
covered  by  the  blossoming  Palasha  Trees. 

With  the  heaps  of  warriors  for  its  banks,  the  broken  weapons 
its  uees,  the  torrents  of  blood  its  huge  waves,  death  appeared 
like  an  ocean  receiving  its  floods ;  livers  and  spleens  its  mire, 
entrails  its  moss,  severed  heads  and  trunks  the  fish,  and  morsels 
of  flesh  the  grass,  innumerable  vultures  its  lovely  swans,  herons 
its  geese,  covered  as  it  was  with  fat  for  the  foam,  the  tumult  the 
sound  of  its  waters,  the  battlefield  resembled  a  river,  incapable  of 
being  crossed,  visited  by  waterfowl  at  the  end  of  the  rainy 
season.  And  the  foremost  of  the  titans  and  the  monkeys  crossed 
over  that  impassable  river  as  elephants  lead  their  herds  across 
a  lake  that  the  lotuses  have  covered  with  pollen. 

Meanwhile  Prahasta,  standing  in  his  chariot,  letting  fly 
countless  shafts  scattering  the  Plavamgamas,  was  observed  by 
Nila  and,  like  unto  a  violent  wind,  the  General  of  the  Titans 
beheld  Nila  advancing  on  him  like  a  mass  of  clouds  in  the  sky. 

Directing  his  chariot  bright  as  the  sun  towards  him,  that 
foremost  of  archers,  stretching  his  bow  in  the  midst  of  the  fray, 
covered  Nila  with  his  barbed  shafts,  which,  piercing  him  in  their 
rapid  flight,  passed  through  his  body  and,  like  furious  serpents, 
buried  themselves  in  the  earth  with  great  spurts.  When  Nila 
was  wounded  by  those  pointed  shafts  resembling  tongues  of  fire, 
that  huge  and  mighty  monkey,  brandishing  a  tree,  struck  that 
143 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

exceedingly  redoubtable  Prahasta  who  had  set  upon  him  with 
such  fury. 

Roaring  with  anger  under  his  blows,  that  lion  among  titans 
overwhelmed  the  monkey  chief  with  a  rain  of  arrows  and  the 
shower  of  missiles  loosed  by  that  cruet  demon  was  received  by 
the  monkey  with  closed  eyes.  Like  a  bull  standing  under  a 
sudden  autumnal  downpour,  so  under  that  intolerable  rain  of 
darts,  Nila  immediately  closed  bis  eyes,  suffering  it,  though  it 
was  scarce  to  be  endured.  Mad  with  rage,  under  the  hail  of 
arrows,  that  great  and  mighty  monkey,  arming  himself  with  a 
Sala  Tree,  struck  down  Prahasta's  horses  and  thereafter  his  heart 
surging  with  anger  he  severed  the  bow  of  that  barbarian,  shouting 
again  and  again. 

Deprived  of  his  bow,  Prahasta,  the  leader  of  the  army, 
seizing  a  formidable  mace,  leapt  down  from  his  chariot,  and  those 
two  generals,  facing  each  other,  adversaries  full  of  courage, 
their  limbs  covered  with  blood,  like  unto  two  elephants  with 
broken  tusks,  tore  each  other  with  their  sharp  teeth.  Lion  and 
tiger  in  gait,  lion  and  tiger  in  prowess,  those  two  warriors, 
vanquishers  of  other  heroes,  intrepid  combatants,  thirsting  for 
fame,  resembled  Vritra  and  Vasava. 

Meanwhile  Prahasta  with  a  supreme  effort  struck  Nila  on  the 
forehead  with  his  mace,  causing  the  blood  to  flow,  whereupon 
that  powerful  monkey,  his  limbs  covered  with  gore,  seized  a 
great  tree  and  struck  Prahasta  full  in  the  chest  with  fury.  He, 
however,  not  heeding  the  impact,  brandishing  an  enormous 
iron  bar,  hurled  himself  on  the  valiant  Plavamgama.  Seeing 
him  advancing  towards  him  with  terrific  bounds,  full  of  rage, 
the  mighty  monkey  Nila,  snatched  up  a  great  rock  which  he 
swiftly  threw  at  the  head  of  his  bellicose  opponent  armed  with  a 
mace.  Loosed  by  that  monkey  chief,  that  immense  and  for- 
midable stone  broke  into  several  pieces  on  Prahasta's  head 
and  the  titan,  deprived  of  breath,  lustre,  strength  and 
consciousness  instantly  fell  on  the  earth,  like  a  tree  severed  at 
the  root. 

From  his  riven  head  and  body  the  blood  flowed,  so  that  it 

resembled  a  torrent  falling  from  a  mountain.    Prahasta  being 

slain  by  Nila,  the  invincible  and  mighty  army  of  the  titans 

bereft  of  joy,  fled  to  Lanka,  their  leader  having  succumbed*  nor 

144 


YUDDHA    RANDA 

could  they  be  stayed,  as  the  waters  of  the  sea  may  not  be  stemmed 
by  a  broken  dyke. 

Their  leader  slain,  the  titans  disconsolate  regained  the  abode 
of  their  sovereign.  Dumb  and  dispirited,  plunged  in  an  ocean 
of  burning  grief,  they  appeared  to  have  lost  their  wits. 

The  triumphant  warrior  Nila,  however,  on  his  return,  was 
honoured  by  Rama  with  Lakshmana  who  accompanied  him, 
and  experienced  supreme  joy.

Ravana's  Prowess.   Rama  overcomes  Mm  but  grants  htm 
his  Life 

Their  General  having  succumbed  in  the  tight  against  the 
foremost  of  the  monkeys,  the  heavily  armed  forces  of  the 
King  of  the  Titans  took  to  flight  with  the  speed  of  the  tide. 

Coming  before  their  lord,  they  apprised  him  of  the  death 
of  their  leader  who  had  fallen  under  the  blows  of  the  Fire-god's 
offspring,  and  at  these  tidings,  the  king  was  transported  with 
anger.  Learning  that  Prahasta  had  perished  in  the  fight,  his 
heart  was  filled  with  grief  and  he  addressed  the  foremost  of  his 
leaders,  as  Indra  those  who  never  grow  old1  and  said  : — 

"  That  foe  is  not  to  be  despised,  under  whose  blows  the 
destroyer  of  Indra's  host,  the  leader  of  my  army  with  his  followers 
and  elephants,  fell.  I  myself  shall  enter  this  strange  battlefield 
without  hesitation  in  order  to  obtain  victory  and  destroy  the 
enemy.  As  a  forest  is  consumed  by  fire,  so  shall  I  to-day 
with  a  myriad  arrows  burn  up  the  simian  army  with  Rama  and 
Lakshmana." 

Speaking  thus,  that  enemy  of  the  Lord  of  the  Celestials 
ascended  his  chariot  which  shone  like  a  flame  and  was  yoked 
to  a  team  of  horses,  its  brilliance  increased  by  the  splendour  of 
his  person. 

The  sound  of  trumpets,  gongs,  drums  and  leonine  roars 
accompanied  by  the  clapping  of  hands,  acclamations  and  hymns 

1  The  Gods,  who  »re  Mid  to  remain  young. 
145 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  praise,  frenziedly  greeted  the  departure  of  the  Sovereign  of 
the  Titans.  Those  eaters  of  flesh,  resembling  mountains  or 
clouds,  whose  glances  flashed  like  torches,  surrounded  the 
supreme  Leader  of  the  Titans  as  he  marched  out,  like  unto 
the  Bhutas  escorting  Rudra,  the  Lord  of  the  Immortals. 
Issuing  from  the  city,  that  monarch  observed  the  army  of 
ferocious  monkeys  with  trees  and  rocks  in  their  hands,  ready  for 
combat,  roaring  like  a  vast  ocean  or  a  mass  of  thunder  clouds. 

Seeing  the  demon  divisions  seething  with  fury,  the  incom- 
parably illustrious  Rama,  whose  arms  resembled  great  serpents, 
accompanied  by  his  forces,  said  to  Bibishana : — 

"  Who  is  in  command  of  this  army  furnished  with  every 
kind  of  standard,  banner  and  canopy,  armed  with  javelins, 
swords,  stakes  and  other  weapons  and  missiles,  that  is  indomitable 
and  composed  of  intrepid  soldiers  and  elephants  as  high  as  the 
Mahendra  Mountain  ?  " 

Thus  interrogated,  Bibishana,  the  equal  of  Shakra  in  valour, 
pointed  out  the  principal  leaders  of  those  courageous  lions 
among  the  titans  to  him  and  said  : — 

"  That  hero  of  coppery  hue  mounted  on  the  back  of  an 
elephant,  causing  its  head  to  sway,  the  rival  of  the  rising  sun, 
know,  O  Prince,  to  be  Akampana. 

"  He  who,  standing  in  his  chariot,  brandishes  his  bow  which 
resembles  Shakra's,  whose  standard  bears  the  image  of  a  lion 
and  who  is  like  unto  an  elephant  with  its  long  curved  tusks,  is 
Indrajita,  who  is  renowned  for  the  boons  he  has  received  from 
Brahma. 

"  That  archer  yonder,  like  unto  the  Vindhya,  Asta  or 
Mahendra  Mountains,  standing  in  his  car,  a  mighty  warrior, 
who  wields  a  bow  of  unequalled  size,  is  called  Atikaya  on  account 
of  his  immense  stature. 

"  The  tawny-eyed  warrior  resembling  the  dawn,  riding  a 
wild  elephant  with  its  bells  jangling,  who  is  shouting  aloud,  is 
Mahodara. 

"  The  rider  of  the  brilliantly  caparisoned  steed  he,  who  is 
armed  with  a  gleaming  javelin  and  resembles  a  mass  of  evening 
clouds,  whose  fury  rivals  the  lightning  and  possesses  the  velocity 
of  a  well-directed  thunder-bolt,  who  is  seated  on  the  foremost 
of  bulls  and  shines  like  the  moon,  is  Trishiras.  The  other, 
146 


YUDDHA     KANDA 

resembling  a  thunder-cloud,  of  large  and  well-developed  chest, 
who  is  twanging  his  bow  and  has  the  King  of  the  Snakes  as  his 
standard,  is  Kumbha. 

"  The  one  who  carries  a  mace  decorated  with  gold  and 
diamonds  from  which  flames  and  smoke  issue,  who  advances 
as  a  standard  bearer  to  the  titan  army,  is  Nikumbha  of  prodigious 
exploits. 

"  That  warrior  in  a  chariot  adorned  with  flags,  gleaming  like 
a  glowing  brazier,  who  is  furnished  with  bows,  swords  and 
arrows,  is  Narantaka,  who,  in  combat,  lights  with  mountain 
peaks. 

"  Finally  the  one  who  appears  surrounded  by  spectres  of 
dreadful  form  with  heads  of  tigers,  buffalo,  mighty  elephants, 
deer  and  horses,  riding  under  a  white  canopy  with  a  slender 
handle,  his  diadem  resembling  the  moon,  he  who  is  the  humbler 
of  the  Gods  themselves,  like  unto  Rudra  amidst  the  Bhutas 
is  the  mighty  Lord  of  the  Titans  himself.  His  countenance 
is  graced  by  swinging  earrings,  his  formidable  stature  equals  the 
Vindhya,  that  Lord  of  Mountains,  he  who  brought  Mahendra  and 
Vaivasvat  low,  is  the  King  of  the  Titans,  equal  to  the  sun  in 
splendour." 

Then  Rama,  the  subduer  of  his  foes  answered  Bibishana 
and  said : — 

"  Ah !  What  glory,  what  exceeding  majesty  is  Ravana's,  the 
Lord  of  the  Titans  !  As  one  cannot  gaze  on  the  sun,  neither 
can  the  eye  rest  on  him,  such  is  the  blinding  strength  of  his 
magnificence !  Neither  Devas,  Danavas  nor  heroes  possess  a 
body  equal  to  his !  Who  can  rival  the  brilliance  of  the  King  of 
the  Titans  ?  All  are  as  high  as  hills,  all  have  crags  as  their 
weapons,  all  are  furnished  with  fiery  darts.  The  Lord  of  the 
Titans  stands  out  among  those  ardent  warriors  as  Antaka  amidst 
the  impetuous  Bhutas  of  strange  form.  It  is  to  his  destruction 
that  that  wretch  comes  to-day  within  my  sight !  To-day  I 
shall  slake  my  wrath  born  of  Sita's  abduction  !  " 

At  these  words,  the  valiant  Rama  who  was  accompanied  by 
Lakshmana,  took  up  his  bow  and,  standing  erect,  placed  an 
arrow,  the  most  powerful  of  all,  upon  it. 

Meanwhile  the  haughty  Monarch  of  the  Titans  said  to  bis 
brave  troops ; — 

*47 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"Take  up  your  positions  unfalteringly  at  the  gates  and 
principal  exits,  the  outposts  and  fortifications,  Learning  of 
my  presence  amongst  you,  these  savages  will  try  and  profit 
by  this  opportunity  to  take  this  heretofore  impregnable  city  by 
surprise,  it  being  now  denuded  of  its  defenders,  and  they  will 
then  immediately  put  it  to  the  sword  with  their  united  forces." 

Thereafter  Havana  dismissed  his  escort  and  the  titans  left 
on  his  orders,  whereupon  he  plunged  into  the  sea  of  monkeys, 
agitating  it  as  a  great  fish  the  waters  of  the  ocean. 

As  soon  as  that  India  of  the  Titans  with  his  bow  and  burnished 
arrows  had  thrown  himself  into  the  fray,  the  leader  of  the 
monkeys  rushed  out  to  meet  him,  tearing  up  a  great  mountain 
peak.  Seizing  that  rock  covered  with  innumerable  trees,  he 
hurled  it  at  that  prowler  of  the  night,  who,  seeing  it  flying  towards 
him,  broke  it  in  pieces  with  his  golden-stemmed  arrows.  That 
huge  and  high  peak  covered  with  trees  being  shattered,  fell 
on  the  earth,  and  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  like  unto  another 
Antaka,  selected  a  dart  resembling  a  great  serpent.  Taking  up 
that  arrow,  which  rivalled  Anila  in  velocity  and  possessed  the 
brilliance  of  fire  and  the  force  of  lightning,  he  loosed  it  with 
fury  on  Sugriva  in  order  to  slay  him,  and  that  weapon,  equal 
to  Shakra's  thunderbolt,  loosed  by  Havana's  arm,  penetrated 
Sugriva's  breast  in  its  flight  as  formerly  Guha's  spear  when 
he  discharged  it  at  the  Krauncha  Mountain. 

Wounded  by  that  missile  which  bereft  him  of  consciousness, 
that  warrior  fell  moaning  to  the  earth.  Beholding  him  stretched 
on  the  ground  deprived  of  bis  senses,  the  Yatudhanas  raised  a 
shout  of  triumph. 

Thereupon  Gavaksha,  Gavaya,  Sushena  as  well  as  Rishabha, 
Jyotirmukha  and  Nala,  of  exceeding  corpulence,  tearing  up 
rocks,  hurled  themselves  on  the  King  of  the  Titans.  Then 
that  Lord  of  the  Titans,  with  hundreds  of  arrows  possessed 
of  sharp  points,  rendered  their  projectiles  fruitless  and  pierced 
those  leaders  of  the  monkeys  with  a  hail  of  marvellous  golden- 
shafted  arrows. 

Under  the  blows  with  which  the  Enemy  of  the  Gods  assailed 
them,  those  generals  of  terrifying  stature  were  overcome, 
whereupon  he  covered  that  formidable  army  of  monkeys  with  a 
shower  of  arrows. 

*4« 


YUDDHA    RANDA 

Assailed  and  wounded,  those  warriors  emitted  cries  of  terror 
and  pain,  and  those  deer  of  the  branches,  whom  Ravana  was 
destroying  with  bis  darts,  fled  for  refuge  to  the  intrepid  Rama, 
whereupon  that  mighty  and  skilful  archer,  Raghava,  seizing  a 
weapon,  set  out  at  once.  Lakshmana  however,  approaching 
him  with  joined  palms,  addressed  him  in  moving  tones,  and 
said : — 

"  Truly,  O  Noble  Brother,  I  am  able  to  slay  this  wretch ! 
It  is  I  who  will  destroy  him,  do  thou  give  me  leave,  O 
Lord ! " 

Then  the  exceedingly  powerful  Rama,  a  true  hero,  answered 
him  saying : — 

"  Go,  O  Lakshmana,  and  in  this  duel  may  thy  valour  prevail ! 
Without  doubt  Ravana  is  endowed  with  great  strength,  he  is  a 
warrior  of  outstanding  prowess  ;  the  Three  Worlds  themselves 
could  not  withstand  his  fury ;  seek  out  his  weak  points  and 
guard  against  thine  own ;  be  ever  vigilant  and  defend  thyself 
with  eye  and  bow  !  " 

Thus  spoke  Raghava  and  Saumitri  embraced  him,  thereafter 
offering  obeisance  to  him  and  bidding  him  farewell,  he  entered 
the  lists.  There  he  beheld  Ravana  with  arms  as  large  as  the 
trunks  of  elephants,  who  was  brandishing  his  dread  and  fiery 
bow,  covering  the  monkeys,  whose  limbs  he  had  severed  with  a 
close  rain  of  darts. 

Beholding  this,  the  exceedingly  energetic  Hanuman,  born  of 
Maruta,  in  order  to  bring  that  rain  of  arrows  to  an  end,  rushed 
on  Ravana  and,  approaching  his  chariot,  lifted  his  right  arm 
and  threatened  him;  thereafter  the  sagacious  Hanuman 
addressed  him,  saying : — 

"  Thou  hast  obtained  the  boon  of  invulnerability  to  Devas, 
Danavas,  Gandharvas,  Yakshas  and  also  Rakshasas  but  the 
monkeys  are  a  danger  to  thee  !  This  five-branched  hand  of 
mine,1  which  I  now  raise,  will  rob  thee  of  the  life  that  has  long 
been  resident  in  thy  body !  " 

At  these  words  of  Hanuman,  the  exceedingly  valiant  Ravana, 
his  eyes  inflamed  with  anger,  answered  : — 

"  Strike  swiftly  without  fear !  Win  eternal  renown,  having 
measured  thy  strength  with  mine,  I  shall  destroy  thee  !  "

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Then  the  son  of  the  Wind  answered  Havana  who  spoke  thus, 
saying : — 

"  Recollect  that  I  have  slain  thy  son  Aksha  already !  " 

At  this,  the  powerful  Lord  of  the  Titans  struck  the  son  of 
Anila  a  violent  blow  with  the  palm  of  his  hand  and  the  monkey 
reeled ;  thereafter  the  mighty  and  illustrious  Hanuman  recovered 
his  balance  and,  steadying  himself,  struck  that  enemy  of  the 
Immortals  in  fury.  Under  the  violent  impact  of  the  monkey's 
blow,  Dashagriva  shook  like  a  mountain  when  the  earth  trembles. 

Seeing  Havana  struck  in  the  fight,  Rishis,  Siddhas  and  monkeys 
raised  a  great  shout,  as  also  the  Devas,  Suras  and  Asuras. 

Then  the  extremely  spirited  Ravana,  having  regained  his 
breath,  said : — 

**  Well  done  !  Well  done  !  O  Monkey,  thou  art  an  adversary 
worthy  of  praise  !  " 

Thus  did  he  speak,  and  Maruti  answered  him,  saying : — 
"  Cursed  be  that  strength  since  thou  dost  still  survive,  O 
Ravana !  Now  come,  enter  into  a  decisive  struggle  with  me, 
O  Perverse  Wretch  !  Why  this  boasting  ?  My  fist  is  about  to 
despatch  thee  to  the  abode  of  Yama  !  " 

Hearing  Hanuman's  words,  the  powerful  Ravana,  enraged, 
his  eyes  red  with  fury,  whirling  his  fist  with  force  brought  it 
down  violently  on  the  monkey's  chest  and,  under  the  shock, 
Hanuman  reeled  once  more,  whilst  the  King  of  the  Titans, 
Dashagriva,  that  exceedingly  fiery  warrior,  seeing  his  valiant 
opponent  bereft  of  strength,  turned  his  chariot  towards  Nila. 
With  his  arrows,  like  unto  great  serpents,  he  pierced  the  vital 
parts  of  his  enemy  overwhelming  the  Monkey  General,  but  Nila, 
the  leader  of  the  monkey  army,  assailed  by  that  hail  of  weapons, 
with  one  hand  flung  a  great  rock  at  the  King  of  the  Titans. 

Meanwhile  Hanuman,  burning  with  courage,  having  re- 
covered bis  senses,  in  his  martial  ire  cried  out  furiously : — 
"  O  Ravana,  King  of  the  Titans,  who  art  engaged  in  combat  with 
Nila,  to  attack  one  already  fighting  with  another  is  unjust !  " 

The  titan,  however,  shattered  the  crag,  hurled  by  Nila,  with 
seven  pointed  darts  so  that  it  fell  in  pieces  and,  seeing  the  rock 
riven  asunder,  the  leader  of  the  monkey  army,  Nila,  destroyer 
of  hostile  forces,  who  resembled  the  Fire  of  Time,  glowed  with 
fury  and  began  to  hurl  Asvakarna,  Sala,  Cuta  and  other  flowering 
150 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

trees  of  varying  fragrance  in  the  fight,  whereupon  Ravana 
caught  them  in  his  arms  and  snapped  them,  showering  a 
formidable  rain  of  shafts,  as  from  a  cloud,  on  Pavaki1  but  that 
colossus,  assuming  a  diminutive  form,  leapt  on  to  the  point  of 
Ravana's  standard. 

Beholding  the  offspring  of  Pavaki  thus  installed  on  the  point 
of  his  standard,  the  King  blazed  with  fury,  whilst  Nila  let  forth 
a  shout,  and  sometimes  the  monkey  leapt  on  to  the  apex  of  the 
banner  and  sometimes  on  to  the  end  of  the  bow  and  sometimes 
on  to  the  peak  of  the  diadem,  so  that  Lakshmana,  Hanuman  and 
Rama  also,  were  astonished. 

The  intrepid  titan  too  was  amazed  at  the  monkey's  agility 
and  took  up  a  marvellous  and  flaming  arrow  but  the  Plavam- 
gamas  shouted  joyously  at  Nila's  tactics,  being  amused  to  see 
Ravana  disconcerted  by  his  leaping  about  in  combat  and  the 
shouts  of  the  monkeys  infuriated  Dashagriva,  who,  in  his  con- 
fusion, did  not  know  how  to  act. 

Taking  up  an  arrow  charged  with  sacred  formulas,  that 
prowler  of  the  night  aimed  at  Nila,  who  had  climbed  to  the 
tip  of  his  standard  and,  at  that  instant,  the  King  of  the  Titans, 
said : — 

"  O  Monkey,  thine  agility  proceeds  from  a  rare  power  of 
magic ;  do  thou  save  thyself  if  thou  canst  by  these  innumerable 
tricks  with  which  thou  art  familiar  and  constantly  employest ! 
This  mantra-propelled  weapon  of  mine,  that  I  am  about  to 
loose,  will  sever  the  existence  thou  seekest  to  retain  !  " 

Speaking  thus,  the  long-armed  Ravana,  Lord  of  the  Titans, 
having  placed  Agni's  shaft  on  his  bow,  struck  Nila,  the  General 
of  the  monkey  army,  with  that  weapon  and  he,  pierced  through 
the  breast  by  that  shaft  charged  with  sacred  mantras,  was 
suddenly  overcome  and  fell  to  the  earth,  yet  by  virtue  of  his 
sire's  powerful  aid  and  bis  own  native  vigour,  though  brought 
to  his  knees  he  was  not  deprived  of  life. 

Beholding  the  monkey  unconscious,  Dashagriva,  insatiable  in 
combat,  in  his  chariot,  whose  rattling  resounded  like  thunder- 
clouds, rushed  on  Lakshmana  and  coming  to  the  centre  of  the 
field,  halted,  standing  there  in  his  glory. 

Thereafter  the  majestic  Lord  of  the  Titans  lifted  up  his  bow, 

*  Pavaki — The  name  of  Nila  as  son  of  the  God  of  Fire. 

151 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

whereupon  Saumkri,  of  indomitable  courage,  said  to  him  as  he 
prepared  to  loose  his  powerful  shaft : — 

"  O  King  of  the  Night-rangers,  now  enter  into  combat  with 
me ;  cease  from  fighting  with  the  monkeys  !  " 

Hearing  that  marvellously  modulated  voice  that  resounded 
like  the  twanging  of  a  bow-string,  the  King,  drawing  near  to  his 
adversary,  who  stood  close  to  his  chariot,  answered  in  anger  : — 

"  O  Son  of  Raghu,  it  is  my  good  fortune  that  brings  thee 
within  my  range  to-day,  thou  who,  in  thy  folly,  advancest  to 
meet  thy  death  !  This  very  instant  thou  shalt  descend  to  the 
region  of  Mrityu  under  a  rain  of  missiles  loosed  by  me." 

Then  Saumitri,  unmoved,  spoke  to  that  boastful  titan  of 
sharp  and  protruding  teeth,  saying  : — 

"O  King,  stout  hearts  eschew  bragging!  O  Greatest  of 
Evil  Doers,  thou  art  sounding  thine  own  praises !  I  am  well 
acquainted  with  thy  strength,  prowess,  vigour  and  audacity, 
O  King  of  the  Titans  !  Approach !  Here  I  stand  with  bow  and 
arrows  in  my  hand ;  of  what  use  are  vain  boasts  ?  " 

Thus  accosted,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  infuriated,  let  fly 
seven  marvellously  plumed  arrows  which  Lakshmana  shattered 
with  his  golden-shafted  darts.  Observing  bis  shafts  resembling 
great  serpents,  whose  coils  had  been  crushed  in  an  instant,  the 
Lord  of  Lanka  was  transported  with  anger  and  let  fly  further 
sharp  arrows.  The  younger  brother  of  Rama,  however,  caused 
a  well-aimed  rain  of  missiles  from  his  bow  to  fall  on  Ravana, 
but  he,  with  the  aid  of  weapons  in  the  forms  of  knives,  crescents 
and  long-eared  arrowheads,  severed  them,  without  allowing 
them  to  disturb  him. 

Seeing  that  the  succession  of  his  shafts  proved  useless,  the 
King  of  those  hostile  to  the  Gods,  astonished  at  Lakshmana's 
skill,  let  fly  more  whetted  shafts  upon  him  anew  and,  from  his 
side,  Lakshmana,  the  equal  of  Mahendra,  placing  some  sharpened 
darts  on  his  bow  that  were  forrnidable,swift  as  lightning  and  of 
blazing  effulgence,  loosed  them  on  the  Titan  King  in  order  to 
strike  him  down,  whereupon  Ravana  shattered  those  pointed 
darts  and  struck  his  rival  in  the  forehead  with  a  shaft  as  bright  as 
the  Fire  of  Time,  which  had  been  bestowed  on  him  by 
Swyambhu.  Then  Lakshmana,  struck  by  that  missile,  reded  a 
little,  scarcely  able  to  retain  his  bow  but  coming  to  himself  with 
15a 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

difficulty,  he  shattered  that  weapon  belonging  to  Indra's  foe. 
Having  broken  bis  bow,  the  son  of  Dasaratha  struck  him  with 
three  pointed  darts  and  the  king,  pierced  by  those  arrows, 
swooned,  regaining  his  senses  with  difficulty.  Wounded  by  those 
shafts,  his  bow  wholly  demolished,  his  limbs  spattered  with 
flesh  and  streaming  with  blood,  the  Enemy  of  the  Gods,  himself 
of  formidable  energy,  seized  a  spear  which  had  been  given  him  in 
war  by  Swyambhu.  That  smoking  lance,  as  bright  as  fire,  the 
terror  of  the  monkeys  in  the  fray,  the  powerful  guardian  of  the 
titan  empire,  was  hurled  on  Saumitri  the  younger  brother  of 
Bharata,  who  received  that  spear  falling  upon  him  with  arrows 
and  darts,  as  if  it  were  a  sacrificial  fire ;  nevertheless  that  weapon 
entered  his  broad  chest. 

The  powerful  Raghu,  struck  by  that  spear,  lay  on  the  earth, 
breathing  fire  and  the  King  of  the  Titans  rushing  on  him  suddenly, 
while  he  was  yet  insensible,  seized  him  brutally  in  his  two  hands, 
yet  though  he  was  able  to  lift  up  Himavat,  Mandara,  Meru  and 
the  Three  Worlds  with  the  Gods,  he  could  not  raise  the  younger 
brother  of  Bharata,  for  Lakshmana,  though  wounded  in  the 
breast  by  Brahma's  weapon,  recollected  that  he  was  of  the 
substance  of  Vishnu  Himself,  and  that  thorn  in  the  side  of  the 
Gods,  though  overcoming  Saumitri,  was  unable  to  bear  him 
away. 

At  that  instant,  the  son  of  Vayu,  enraged,  threw  himself  in 
anger  on  Ravana  like  a  flash  of  lightning  and  struck  him  with 
his  fist  on  the  chest  Under  that  blow,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans 
was  brought  to  his  knees  and  stumbling,  fell.  From  his  ten 
mouths,  eyes  and  ears,  blood  streamed  in  torrents  and,  rolling 
unconscious,  he  slid  under  the  body  of  the  chariot;  there  he 
remained  deprived  of  his  senses,  stupified,  not  knowing  where 
he  was.  Beholding  Ravana,  despite  his  redoubtable  strength 
swoon  on  the  battlefield,  Rishis  and  monkeys  began  to  shout  in 
triumph  as  did  also  the  Gods  and  Asuras,  whilst  the  courageous 
Hanuman  lifting  up  Lakshmana  in  his  arms,  who  had  been 
wounded  by  his  adversary,  returned  to  Raghava.  In  bis 
friendship  and  extreme  devotion  to  him,  the  son  of  Vayu  found 
Lakshmana,  whom  foes  were  unable  to  move,  as  light  as  a 
feather.  Thereafter  the  spear,  that  had  overcome  Saumitri, 
returned  to  the  titan's  chariot. 

*53 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Meanwhile  Ravana  who  was  full  of  energy  in  combat,  having 
recovered  consciousness,  selected  some  steel-pointed  arrows 
and  armed  himself  with  an  enormous  bow. 

On  his  side,  healed  and  freed  from  that  lance,  Lakshmana 
recollected  that  he  was  part  of  Vishnu,  and  Rama,  seeing  the 
innumerable  army  of  powerful  monkeys  overthrown  on  the 
battlefield,  rushed  on  Ravana,  but  Hanuman,  following  him, 
said : — 

"  Climb  on  my  shoulders  in  order  to  overcome  the  titan  !  " 

Hearing  those  words  from  the  son  of  Vayu,  Raghava  climbed 
on  the  shoulders  of  that  great  monkey,  as  Vishnu  on  Garuda, 
in  order  to  fight  with  the  Enemy  of  the  Gods. 

Standing  in  his  chariot,  Ravana  appeared  before  that  Lord 
of  Men  and,  seeing  him,  that  mighty  hero  rushed  upon  him, 
like  unto  Vishnu  with  his  mace  upraised  rushing  furiously  on 
Virochana.  Thereupon  Rama  drew  the  cord  of  bis  bow  and, 
like  unto  the  roll  of  thunder,  said  in  a  deep  voice  to  the  Lord  of 
the  Titans  :— 

"  Stay  1  Stay !  Thou  hast  evoked  my  displeasure !  Where, 
O  Tiger  among  the  Titans,  wilt  thou  flee  to  escape  me  ?  Even  if 
thou  seekest  refuge  in  the  region  of  Indra  or  Vaivaswata  or 
Bhaskara  or  Swyambhu,  Vaishnavara,  Shankara  or  in  the  ten 
regions,  even  in  those  abodes  thou  shalt  not  elude  me  from  now 
on.  The  one  who,  struck  by  the  spear,  fell  swooning  this  day 
only  to  recover  consciousness  immediately,  shall  now,  assuming 
the  form  of  death,  claim  thee,  thy  sons,  and  grandsons  in  battle. 
O  King  of  the  Titan  People,  here  is  he  under  whose  blows, 
fourteen  thousand  titans  of  terrible  form  perished,  who  had 
established  themselves  in  Janasthana  and  were  furnished  with 
excellent  weapons." 

Hearing  Raghava  speak  thus,  the  exceedingly  powerful  Lord 
of  the  Titans  full  of  rage,  hurled  himself  on  the  son  of  Vayu, 
who  was  bearing  Rama  with  extreme  velocity  through  the  fray 
and,  recollecting  his  former  hostility,  he  smote  him  with 
flaming  arrows  resembling  the  tongues  of  the  Fire  of  Dissolution, 
Struck  by  that  titan  as  also  pierced  by  his  darts,  the  native 
strength  of  which  Hanuman  was  possessed  increased  still  further. 
Nevertheless  the  extremely  illustrious  Rama,  seeing  the  wound 
that  Ravana  had  just  inflicted  on  that  lion  among  the  Plavagas, 
154 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

was  transported  with  anger  and,  approaching  his  chariot  with 
his  slender  and  pointed  shafts,  shattered  it  with  its  wheels, 
horses,  banner,  canopy,  great  standard,  charioteer,  darts,  spears 
and  swords  ;  thereafter,  with  great  force,  he  hurled  a  weapon 
like  unto  a  thunderbolt  falling  on  Mount  Mem  so  that  that 
valiant  monarch,  whom  neither  thunder  nor  lightning  could 
cause  to  tremble,  stumbled,  letting  fall  his  bow  at  the  violent 
impact  of  Rama's  missile,  which  created  a  deep  wound. 

Seeing  him  swooning,  the  magnanimous  Rama  took  up  a 
flaming  arrow  shaped  like  a  crescent  moon  and  used  it  to  shatter 
the  crown  of  the  supreme  Lord  of  the  Titans,  which  was  as 
bright  as  the  sun. 

Then  Rama  said  to  that  Indra  of  the  Titans,  whose  splendour 
was  dimmed,  the  setting  of  his  diadem  riven,  and  who  resembled 
a  venomous  snake  robbed  of  its  poison,  or  the  sun,  its  rays 
extinguished,  bereft  of  lustre : — 

*'  Thou  hast  accomplished  a  great  feat  and  my  brave  soldiers 
have  succumbed  beneath  thy  blows ;  now  thou  art  weary ;  in 
this  condition  I  shall  not  put  thee  under  Mrityu's  power  with 
my  shafts.  Leave  the  fray  and  return  to  Lanka ;  I  grant  thee 
this  reprieve,  O  King  of  the  Rangers  of  the  Night !  Having 
regained  thy  breath,  return  in  thy  chariot  with  thy  bow  and, 
standing  on  thy  car,  thou  shalt  once  more  bear  testimony  to  my 
prowess !  " 

At  these  words,  his  joy  and  boasting  subdued,  his  bow 
shattered,  his  horses  and  charioteer  slain,  pierced  with  arrows, 
his  great  diadem  broken,  the  king  instantly  returned  to  Lanka. 

After  the  departure  of  that  powerful  Indra  of  Night  Rangers, 
Lakshmana  drew  out  the  arrows  from  the  monkeys,  which  they 
had  received  while  fighting  in  the  forefront  of  that  vast  battle- 
field, and  the  adversary  of  the  King  of  the  Gods  being  van- 
quished, all  the  Celestials,  Asuras  and  creatures  of  the  ocean 
and  other  regions  with  the  great  serpents,  as  also  all  beings 
on  earth  and  in  the  waters,  rejoiced.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    60 

The  Titan$  rouse  Kumbhakarna 

Returning  to  the  City  of  Lanka,  afflicted  with  the  fear  of 
Rama's  arrows,  his  pride  humbled,  the  king's  mind  was  troubled. 
Like  an  elephant  by  a  lion  or  a  snake  by  Garuda,  that  monarch 
had  been  overcome  by  the  great-souled  Rama,  and  the  Lord  of 
the  Titans  was  maddened  by  the  mere  recollection  of  Rama's 
shafts  possessed  of  the  splendour  of  lightning,  resembling  the 
Rod  of  Brahma. 

Seated  on  his  magnificent  and  elevated  throne  made  of  gold, 
he  let  his  gaze  wander  over  the  titans  and  said : — 

"  Since  I,  the  equal  of  the  mighty  Indra,  have  been  defeated 
by  a  mere  man,  all  the  rigorous  asceticism  I  have  practised  has 
been  in  vain.  I  asked  to  be  rendered  invulnerable  to  Devas, 
Danavas,  Gandharvas,  Yakshas,  Rakshasas  and  Pannagas,  but 
of  man  I  made  no  mention.  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha  is  the 
one,  I  deem,  of  whom  Anaranya,1  born  of  the  race  of  Ikshvaku 
spoke,  saying: — 

"  *6  Lord  of  the  Titans,  in  my  House  will  be  born  a  man  who 
will  slay  thee  in  battle  with  thy  sons,  ministers,  army  and 
charioteer,  O  Vilest  of  Thy  Race,  O  Perverse  Wretch !  * 

"  I  was  further  cursed  by  Vcdavati  for  a  former  outrage  and 
perchance  she  has  been  born  as  the  bigh-souled  daughter  of 
Janaka  and  what  was  predicted  by  Uma,  Nandishwara,  Rambha 
and  Punjikasthala,  the  daughter  of  Varuna,  has  come  to  pass  ! 
The  words  of  the  sages  never  prove  false,  it  is  on  account 
of  all  this  therefore  that  you  should  exert  yourselves  to  the 
uttermost. 

"  Let  the  titans  go  to  the  summit  of  the  Charyapura  Mountain 
and  awaken  Kumbhakarna  on  whom  the  curse  of  Brahma  rests, 
he  who  is  without  equal  in  prowess  and  who  humbles  the  pride 
of  the  Gods  and  Danavas  themselves." 


156 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Prahasta  being  slain  and  the  king  himself  defeated  in  the 
fight,  that  monarch  issued  his  commands  to  the  dreadful  host, 
saying : — 

"  Guard  the  gates  and  man  the  ramparts,  rouse  Kumbhakarna 
who  is  slumbering  soundly.  He  is  sleeping  peacefully  oblivious 
of  all  that  is  passing,  his  senses  overcome  by  lust,  and  he  remains 
unconscious  for  periods  of  two  or  three  or  nine  days  and  some- 
times for  six,  seven  or  eight  months.  Having  met  in  consultation 
with  me  nine  days  ago,  he  has  since  fallen  asleep.  In  combat, 
that  warrior  is  the  rampart  of  all  the  titans  ;  he  will  soon  strike 
down  all  the  monkeys  and  those  two  sons  of  a  king.  He  is  the 
very  banner  of  the  titans  in  battle  but  that  insensate  one, 
intent  on  vulgar  pleasures,  still  slumbers.  Though  overcome 
by  Rama  in  this  terrible  struggle,  my  fears  will  be  dissipated 
when  Kumbhakarna  wakes ;  of  what  use  is  this  rival  of  Indra 
to  me,  if,  in  so  pressing  a  danger,  he  is  not  ready  to  assist 
me?  " 

Hearing  their  sovereign's  words,  the  titans  ran  in  great  haste 
to  Kumbhakaraa's  abode.  At  Ravana's  command,  those  eaters 
of  flesh  and  drinkers  of  blood  took  perfumes,  garlands  and  a 
great  store  of  food  and  left  immediately.  They  entered  that 
cave  with  its  gates  measuring  a  league  in  extent,  the  wonderful 
refuge  of  Kumbhakarna,  from  which  issued  the  fragrance  of 
flowers.  And  with  his  breathing,  Kumbhakarna  pressed  those 
titans  back  despite  their  strength  who,  with  difficulty,  had 
penetrated  into  the  cave. 

When  they  had  entered  into  that  ravishing  underground 
dwelling  paved  with  precious  stones  and  gold,  those  lions 
among  the  Nairritas  beheld  that  redoubtable  giant  lying  there, 
and  that  monster,  wrapt  in  profound  slumber,  resembled  a 
crumbling  mountain  and  together  they  sought  to  waken  him. 

His  limbs  covered  with  down  which  stood  on  end, 
Kumbhakarna,  he  of  irresistible  valour,  was  breathing  like  a 
serpent,  and,  as  he  slept,  he  emitted  dreadful  snores,  his  nostrils 
being  horrible  and  his  mouth  a  gaping  hell.  Stretched  to  his 
full  length  on  the  earth,  he  gave  forth  an  odour  of  marrow  and 
blood ;  his  limbs  were  adorned  with  golden  armlets  and  he 
wore  a  diadem  as  bright  as  the  sun ;  thus  did  that  lion  among 
the  Nairritas,  Kumbhakarna,  the  slayer  of  his  foes,  appear  ! 
157 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Then  those  powerful  titans,  in  order  to  satisfy  him,  placed  a 
heap  of  venison  as  high  as  Mount  Meru  before  him  and  piled 
up  a  great  mass  of  viands,  antelope,  buffalo  and  bear  and  a 
prodigious  mound  of  victuals,  leathern  bottles  of  blood  and 
meats  of  every  kind  before  Kumbhakarna,  the  Enemy  of  the 
Gods.  Thereafter  they  rubbed  that  scourge  of  his  foes  with 
the  most  rare  sandalwood  and  covered  him  with  celestial 
garlands,  and  sweet  smelling  perfumes,  and  they  burnt  incense 
and  hymned  the  praises  of  that  warrior  who  proved  fatal  to  his 
foes. 

The  voices  of  the  Yatudhanas  burst  forth  on  every  side  like 
thunder  and  with  full  cheeks  they  blew  impatiently  on  their 
conches  as  bright  as  the  moon,  causing  a  terrible  uproar,  and 
those  rangers  of  the  night  clapped  their  hands  and  shook 
Kumbhakarna,  creating  a  great  clamour,  in  order  to  awaken 
him,  so  that  the  birds  passing  through  the  air  fell  down  at  the 
sound  of  the  conches,  drums,  gongs,  clapping  of  hands  and 
leonine  roars. 

As  the  illustrious  Kumbhakarna  did  not  waken  from  his 
slumber  despite  the  great  uproar,  all  those  troops  of  titans 
seized  hold  of  bars,  pestles,  maces,  rocks,  clubs,  hammers,  and 
with  these  and  blows  from  their  fists,  those  titans  beat  the  chest 
of  Kumbhakarna  violently  as  he  was  sleeping  peacefully  on  the 
ground.  And  Kumbhakaraa's  breathing  prevented  those  titans 
from  standing  upright  so  that  they  had  to  seat  themselves  round 
him  and,  with  all  their  strength,  which  was  considerable,  they 
began  to  beat  drums,  cymbals  and  gongs  and  to  blow  their 
myriad  conches  and  trumpets.  Ten  thousand  demons  sur- 
rounded that  colossus  who  resembled  a  heap  of  antimony,  and 
tried  in  every  way  to  rouse  him  by  their  blows  and  cries; 
nevertheless  be  did  not  wake. 

As  they  were  unable  to  rouse  him  by  these  means,  they  had 
resort  to  more  energetic  and  ruthless  methods,  causing  horses, 
camels  and  elephants,  whom  they  beat  with  sticks,  whips  and 
thongs,  to  trample  upon  him,  while  gongs,  conches  and  trumpets 
blared  forth  as  they  crushed  his  limbs  under  piles  of  heavy  logs. 
The  noise  of  the  hammers  and  pestles  they  wielded  with  all 
their  strength  and  the  shouts  they  raised  filled  the  whole  of 
Lanka  with  its  hills  and  woods  but  still  he  did  not  wake. 
158 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Then  they  beat  a  thousand  drums  simultaneously  with  sticks 
of  refined  gold  but  yet  he  did  not  stir  from  his  profound 
slumber,  being  under  the  spell  of  the  divine  curse. 

Finally  those  powerful  rangers  of  the  night,  growing  enraged, 
redoubled  their  efforts  in  order  to  rouse  the  titan  and  some 
beat  drums,  some  shouted,  some  tore  out  his  hair  and  others  bit 
his  ears,  pouring  hundreds  of  pitchers  of  water  into  them,  but 
Kumbhakarna,  plunged  in  deep  sleep,  did  not  stir.  Some 
armed  with  daggers  struck  that  mighty  titan  on  the  head,  chest 
and  limbs  but  that  monster  did  not  wake,  though  smitten  by 
Shataghnis  fastened  with  ropes,  and  at  last  a  thousand  titans 
ran  up  and  down  his  body,  till  Kumbhakarna,  becoming  aware 
of  that  pressure,  he  who  had  remained  insensible  to  the  violent 
blows  of  crags  and  trees,  under  the  prompting  of  extreme  hunger 
suddenly  emerged  from  sleep,  yawning,  and  with  one  bound, 
stood  up.  Waving  his  two  arms  resembling  serpent's  coils  or 
the  peaks  of  mountains,  hard  as  cut  diamonds,  that  ranger  of  the 
night  opened  his  monstrous  mouth,  like  unto  Vadavamukha  and 
yawned  horribly,  and  when  he  yawned,  his  mouth  resembled 
hell  and  glittered  like  the  sun  rising  over  the  high  peak  of  Mt. 
Meru. 

That  extremely  powerful  ranger  of  the  night,  being  awake, 
yawned,  heaving  a  sigh  like  unto  a  tempest  that  shatters  a 
mountain ;  and  Kumbhakarna,  rising  up,  resembling  Time  at 
the  dissolution  of  the  world,  prepared  to  devour  all  beings  and 
his  two  great  eyes,  like  glowing  braziers,  glittering  like  lightning, 
resembled  two  huge  flaming  planets. 

Then  they  pointed  to  those  victuals  of  every  kind,  boar  and 
buffalo  and  the  giant  devoured  them.  Thereafter  that  enemy 
of  Shakra's  satisfied  his  hunger  with  flesh  and  his  thirst  with 
blood,  and  he  swallowed  pitchers  full  of  fat  and  wine,  whereupon 
he,  having  feasted,  those  rangers  of  the  night  approached  him 
and,  surrounding  him,  paid  obeisance  to  him. 

Raising  his  eyelids  that  were  heavy  with  sleep,  his  gaze  still 
veiled,  he  let  bis  glance  fall  on  the  night  rangers  on  every  side 
and,  in  a  voice  of  authority,  that  lion  among  the  Nairritas, 
surprised  at  being  roused,  enquired  of  them,  saying  : — 

"  For  what  reason  have  you  thus  wakened  me  so  suddenly  ? 
Is  all  well  with  the  king  or  is  he  in  some  peril  ?  In  truth  there 
159 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

must  be  some  pressing  and  serious  danger  from  an  external 
source  since  you  have  come  in  haste  to  awaken  me.  I  shall 
drive  every  misfortune  away  from  the  King  of  the  Titans  this 
very  day  even  if  I  have  to  cut  Mahendra  himself  to  pieces  or 
freeze  Anala !  Nay,  it  is  certain  that  one  does  not  interrupt 
the  slumbers  of  one,  such  as  I,  for  any  trivial  motive.  Tell 
me  frankly  for  what  reason  you  have  roused  me,  Kumbhakarna, 
the  vanquisher  of  my  foes  ?  " 

At  these  words,  that  were  tinged  with  wrath,  Yupaksha,  the 
king's  confidential  minister,  with  joined  palms,  answered  him 
saying : — 

"  It  is  not  the  Gods  who  threaten  us  in  any  way  but  a  man 
who  has  placed  us  in  this  evil  case,  O  Prince !  It  is  not  the 
Devas  or  Danavas  who  have  put  us  in  this  peril ;  it  comes  to 
us  from  a  mortal.  Monkeys  as  large  as  hills  are  besieging 
Lanka !  Furious  on  account  of  Sita's  abduction,  Rama  is 
pressing  us  heavily.  Recently  a  single  monkey  set  fire  to  our 
great  city  and  slew  the  youthful  Prince  Aksha  with  his  escort 
of  elephants.  '  Get  thee  hence ! '  were  the  words  addressed 
by  Rama  to  the  King  of  the  Titans  in  person,  the  offspring  of 
Poulastya,  that  thorn  in  the  side  of  the  Gods,  he  who  is  equal 
to  Aditya  in  splendour.  That  which  this  monarch  never 
suffered  at  the  hands  of  the  Gods  or  Daityas  or  Danavas,  he  has 
had  to  endure  from  Rama,  who  spared  his  life." 

Hearing  from  Yupaksha  that  his  brother  had  been  defeated 
in  combat,  Kumbhakarna,  rolling  his  great  eyes,  said : — 

"  This  very  day,  O  Yupaksha,  the  whole  army  of  monkeys 
with  Lakshmana  and  Raghava  will  be  destroyed  by  me  on  the 
field  of  battle  after  I  have  presented  myself  before  Ravana. 
I  shall  gorge  the  titans  on  the  blood  of  monkeys  and,  as  for 
Rama  and  Lakshmana,  I  shall  drink  their  blood  myself  1 " 

Hearing  these  bold  words  from  that  titan,  whose  anger 
increased  his  ferocity,  Mahodara,  the  Leader  of  the  Nairrita 
warriors,  having  offered  him  obeisance  with  joined  palms, 
said  to  him  : — 

"  When  thou  hast  listened  to  Ravana  and  weighed  the 
advantages  and  disadvantages  of  the  matter,  then,  O  Long-armed 
Warrior,  set  out  immediately  and  destroy  the  foe  on  the  battle- 
field.'* 

1 60 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Thus  spoke  Mahodara  and  Kumbhakarna,  surrounded  by 
titans,  full  of  energy  and  prowess,  prepared  to  depart.  Thereupon 
the  titans,  having  succeeded  in  rousing  that  prince  of  dreadful 
aspect  and  formidable  valour,  returned  to  the  king's  palace  in 
all  haste.  Approaching  Dashagriva  who  was  seated  on  the 
throne,  all  those  night-rangers  with  joined  palms  said  to  him  : — 

"  Thy  brother,  Kumbhakama,  has  wakened,  O  King  of  the 
Titans,  and  now  is  it  thy  will  that  he  should  enter  the  battlefield 
or  dost  thou  desire  him  to  come  hither  ?  " 

Thereupon  Ravana  answered  those  titans  who  stood  before 
him  and,  with  a  glad  heart,  said  : — 

"  I  desire  to  see  him  here ;  let  him  receive  the  honours  due 
to  his  rank  !  " 

"  Be  it  so  !  "  answered  all  the  titans  and  they  returned  to 
Kumbhakarna  in  order  to  apprise  him  of  Havana's  command 
and  said : — 

"  Do  thou  go  to  the  king,  that  lion  of  all  the  titans  desires  to 
see  thee ;  go  and  gratify  thy  brother !  " 

Then  Kumbhakarna,  that  indomitable  and  mighty  warrior, 
hearing  what  was  his  brother's  wish,  cried : — "  So  be  it ! "  and 
leapt  up  from  his  couch.  Washing  his  face  and  bathing, 
refreshed  and  delighted,  he  desired  them  to  bring  him  to  drink 
with  speed,  whereupon  they  brought  him  a  soothing  draught 
and  those  titans  hastened  to  carry  out  Havana's  commands  and 
presented  him  with  wines  and  meats  of  every  kind. 

Having  swallowed  two  thousand  full  pitchers,  Kumbhakarna 
prepared  to  set  out  and,  slightly  inebriated  and  flushed,  he  was 
exhilarated  and  filled  with  energy.  Impatiently,  he  marched 
away  like  Yama  at  the  end  of  the  World  period,  and  approaching 
his  brother's  palace,  he  caused  the  earth  to  tremble  with  his 
tread.  His  body  illumined  the  royal  highway,  like  unto  that 
orb  of  a  thousand  rays  which  gives  light  to  the  earth  and,  as  he 
advanced,  surrounded  by  a  circle  of  titans  paying  him  obeisance, 
he  resembled  Shatakratu  approaching  Swyambhu's  abode. 

Seeing  that  slayer  of  his  foes  on  the  royal  highway,  that 
monster  as  high  as  the  peak  of  a  mountain,  the  inhabitants 
of  the  woods,  stationed  outside  (the  city)  as  also  their  leaders, 
were  seized  with  a  sudden  panic. 

Some  rushed  to  Rama  for  refuge,  others  fled  away  in  fear, 
161 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

some,  terrified,  stampeded  in  all  directions,  others,  paralysed 
with  fright,  lay  on  the  ground. 

Beholding  that  giant  like  a  great  peak,  adorned  with  a  diadem, 
who  seemed  to  quench  the  sun  with  his  brilliance,  the  inhabitants 
of  the  woods  were  seized  with  terror  and,  at  the  sight  of  that 
prodigy,  fled  in  all  directions. 


CHAPTER    6  I 

The  Story  of  Kumbkakarna 

Meanwhile  the  illustrious  and  valiant  Rama,  bow  in  hand, 
beheld  that  giant  Kumbhakarna  adorned  with  a  diadem  and, 
seeing  that  Indra  among  Titans  with  golden  armlets,  who 
resembled  a  mountain  and  was  like  unto  a  cloud  charged  with 
rain,  or  Narayana1  when  formerly  taking  the  three  strides, 
the  monkeys  scattered  once  more. 

In  view  of  the  stampede  of  his  forces  and  that  titan,  who 
appeared  to  be  increasing  in  size,  Rama,  astonished,  enquired  of 
Bibishana : — 

"  Who  is  this  hero  with  a  diadem  and  yellow  eyes,  resembling 
a  mountain,  who  is  to  be  seen  in  Lanka  like  unto  a  cloud  riven 
by  lightning  or  a  great  and  strange  meteor  which  has  fallen  to 
earth ;  he,  at  whose  sight,  the  monkeys  flee  away  on  all  sides  ? 
Tell  me,  who  is  this  colossus  ?  Is  it  a  Rakshasa  or  an  Asura  ? 
Never  have  I  seen  such  a  being !  " 

Thus  questioned  by  Prince  Rama  of  imperishable  exploits, 
Bibishana,  in  his  great  wisdom,  answered : — 

"  It  is  he  by  whom  Vaivasvata  and  Vasava  were  defeated  in 
battle  ;  it  is  the  illustrious  Kumbhakarna,  the  son  of  Vaishravas  I 
There  is  no  titan  equal  to  him  in  stature,  he  routed  the  Devas, 
Danavas,  Yakshas,  Bhujamgas,  Pishitashanas,  Gandharvas, 
Vidyadharas  and  Pannagas  in  their  thousands,  O  Raghava ! 
The  Gods  themselves  are  not  able  to  slay  Kumbhakarna,  who, 
spear  in  hand,  is  of  monstrous  aspect.  '  It  is  the  God  of  Death 
himself '  they  cry.

YUDDHA    KANDA 

"  The  mighty  Kumbhakarna  is  innately  powerful,  whilst  the 
foremost  of  the  titans  owe  their  strength  to  the  boons  they  have 
received.  As  soon  as  that  monster  was  born  and  while  yet  an 
infant,  urged  on  by  hunger,  he  devoured  thousands  of  beings. 
Seeing  their  kind  consumed,  those  creatures,  mad  with  fear, 
took  refuge  with  Shakra  and  told  him  all  that  had  taken  place. 
Enraged,  Mahendra  struck  Kumbhakarna  with  his  mighty 
thunderbolt  and,  at  the  impact  of  Indra's  weapon,  that  giant 
reeled  howling  with  terror. 

"  When  the  cries  of  the  titan  were  heard,  the  fear  of  those 
beings  increased,  and  in  his  anger,  the  mighty  Kumbhakarna 
tore  out  one  of  Airavata's  tusks  in  order  to  pierce  Vasava's 
breast  and,  under  the  blows  of  that  monster,  Indra  appeared 
like  a  name.  Seeing  this,  the  Devas,  Brahmarishis  and  Danavas 
were  thunderstruck  and  Shakra  with  those  Celestials  went  to 
Swyambhu's  abode  and  informed  Prajapati  of  Kumbhakama's 
wickedness  ;  he  also  described  to  the  inhabitants  of  the  heavenly 
region,  how  he  had  devoured  all  those  creatures,  laid  waste  the 
hermitages  and  carried  off  others  wives  and  said '  If  he  continues 
to  devour  those  beings,  in  a  short  time  the  whole  world  will 
become  a  desert*. 

"  Hearing  Vasava's  words,  the  Grandsire  of  the  Worlds 
summoned  that  titan,  who  appeared  before  him.  On  beholding 
Kumbhakarna,  Prajapati  was  troubled  but,  recovering  himself, 
said  to  him  : — 

"  'Assuredly  Poulastya  begot  thee  to  the  destruction  of  the 
worlds  !  From  to-day  thou  shall  sleep  like  the  dead  !  *  Struck 
by  the  Lord's  curse  that  titan  fell  down  before  him. 

"  Meanwhile  Ravana,  exceedingly  perturbed,  said  to  Brahma: — 

"  'Thou  hast  hewn  down  the  golden  tree  which  was  about 
to  bear  fruit!  It  does  not  behove  thee  to  curse  thine  own 
grandson,  O  Prajapati ;  nevertheless  thy  words  may  never  prove 
vain  ;  assuredly  he  must  slumber  but  at  least  appoint  a  time  for 
sleeping  and  a  time  for  waking  1 ' 

"  On  Havana's  request,  Swyambhu  answered : — '  He  shall 
sleep  for  six  months  and  wake  for  a  single  day ;  for  one  day  that 
warrior  shall  range  the  earth  in  order  to  appease  his  hunger, 
otherwise  with  his  huge  mouth  he  will  consume  the  worlds 
like  a  great  fire.'

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  It  is  in  fear  of  thy  prowess  that  the  Ring  Ravana,  beset  with 
peril,  has  now  awakened  Kumbhakarna,  and  that  warrior  of 
exceeding  valour  has  emerged  from  his  retreat  transported  with 
anger  and  is  rushing  upon  the  monkeys  in  order  to  devour  them 
and  appease  his  hunger.  Seeing  Kumbhakarna  they  have 
taken  to  flight;  how  can  those  monkeys  withstand  him  in 
combat?  Let  them  be  told  that  he  is  merely  a  mechanical 
device  created  to  frighten  them ;  at  these  tidings  they  will  take 
heart  and  remain  here." 

Hearing  Bibishana's  eloquent  and  persuasive  speech,  Raghava 
said  to  the  General  Nila : — 

"  Go,  rally  thy  forces  and,  having  occupied  the  outposts  of 
Lanka,  the  highways  and  bridges,  let  them  strike  camp,  O 
Pavaki!  See  that  the  monkeys,  furnished  with  rocks,  trees 
and  stones,  arm  themselves  with  these  weapons." 

At  Rama's  command,  Nila,  the  leader  in  chief,  a  prince  of 
monkeys,  issued  his  orders  to  the  army  and  thereafter  armed 
with  boulders,  Gavaksha,  Sharabha,  Hanuman  and  Angada, 
like  unto  hills,  advanced  to  the  gates. 

Having  listened  to  Rama,  the  monkeys,  those  valiant  apes, 
fell  upon  the  enemy's  army  with  shouts  of  triumph,  battering  it 
with  trees  and  that  ferocious  company  of  monkeys,  brandishing 
crags  and  trees,  appeared  as  resplendent  as  a  lowering  mass  of 
clouds  spreading  over  a  mountain.

The  Meeting  between  Kumbhakarna  and  Ravana 

Meanwhile  that  Lion  among  the  Titans,  resplendent  in  glory, 
still  heavy  with  sleep,  advanced  with  great  strides  along  the 
royal  highway ;  titans  in  their  thousands  surrounded  that  most 
invincible  of  warriors  and,  from  the  houses,  a  rain  of  flowers 
fell  upon  him  as  he  passed. 

Thereafter  he  beheld  the  vast  and  enchanting  residence 
covered  with  gold  of  that  Indra  of  the  Titans  which  shone  like 
the  sun,  resembling  that  orb  when  it  enters  a  mass  of  clouds,

and  he  penetrated  into  the  palace  belonging  to  the  King  of  the 
Titans,  observing  him  from  afar  on  his  throne,  like  unto  Shakra 
approaching  Swyambhu  seated  in  state. 

Coming  to  Ravana's  abode  with  his  escort  of  titans, 
Kumbhakarna,  pacing  the  earth,  caused  it  to  tremble.  Having 
crossed  the  threshold  of  the  palace,  he  passed  through  the 
courtyard  and  perceived  his  elder  brother,  who  appeared 
troubled,  seated  in  the  Chariot  Pushpaka.  Full  of  anxiety, 
Dashagriva,  beholding  Kumbhakarna,  immediately  rose  up 
joyfully  and  motioned  him  to  approach. 

Then  that  mighty  warrior,  bowing  to  the  feet  of  his  brother, 
who  was  reclining  on  a  couch,  enquired  of  him :— "  What  dost 
thou  desire  of  me  ?  ** 

With  renewed  delight,  Ravana  rose  and  embraced  him 
whereupon  with  brotherly  salutations  and  traditional  courtesies, 
Kumbhakarna  ascended  the  celestial  and  shining  throne,  and 
that  giant  being  seated,  his  eyes  red  with  anger,  enquired  of 
Ravana : — 

"  Why  hast  thou  forcibly  torn  me  from  my  slumber,  O  King  ? 
Say  from  whence  springs  thy  fear  and  whom  dost  thou  wish 
me  to  slay  this  day  ?  " 

Then  Ravana  answered  the  enraged  Kumbhakarna  seated 
beside  him,  who  was  rolling  his  inflamed  eyes,  and  said : — 

"  Thou  hast  slumbered  for  some  time,  O  Warrior,  and,  in 
thy  profound  oblivion,  wert  indifferent  to  the  peril  in  which 
Rama  has  plunged  me.  This  glorious  and  mighty  son  of 
Dasaratha  accompanied  by  Sugriva,  having  crossed  the  sea 
without  hindrance,  is  destroying  our  race.  Alas  !  See  how 
by  means  of  a  bridge,  these  monkeys  have  made  an  ocean  of  the 
woods  and  groves  of  Lanka ! 

"  The  foremost  of  the  titans  have  been  slain  by  them  in 
combat,  nor  do  I  see  how  these  monkeys  can  be  destroyed  in 
battle  by  any  means.  Save  us  from  this  great  peril,  O  Mighty 
Hero,  and  exterminate  them  to-day !  It  is  on  this  account 
that  thou  hast  been  awakened ;  all  my  resources  are  exhausted  ! 
Help  me  to  save  the  City  of  Lanka,  in  which  the  children  and  the 
aged  alone  remain.  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  for  thy  brother's 
sake,  accomplish  this  feat,  impossible  to  another.  I  have  never 
before  spoken  thus  to  any  of  my  brothers,  O  Scourge  of  Thy 

h  165 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Foes  !  I  have  placed  my  supreme  hopes  and  affections  on  thee  ! 
O  Bull  among  the  Titans,  how  often,  in  the  wars  between  Devas 
and  Asuras,  hast  thou  overcome  the  Gods  and  Celestial  Beings 
ranged  against  thee  !  Call  upon  thy  valour,  assuredly  among 
all  creatures  none  is  equal  to  thee  in  strength,  O  Redoubtable 
Hero !  Render  me  this  great  service,  O  Thou,  the  lover  of 
combat ;  do  this  for  me,  O  Thou  who  art  devoted  to  thy  friends  ! 
By  thy  personal  prowess  scatter  these  hostile  forces  as  the  wind 
scatters  the  autumnal  clouds." 


CHAPTER    63 

Kumbhakarna  consoles  Ravana 

Hearing  the  lament  of  the  King  of  the  Titans,  Kumbhakarna 
said  with  a  mocking  laugh : — 

"  As  an  evil  doer  falls  into  hell  as  a  result  of  his  misdeeds,  a 
swift  retribution  has  followed  on  the  error  of  judgment  we  saw 
thee  commit  formerly  in  council  through  lack  of  trust  in  thy 
ministers !  Firstly,  O  Great  King,  thou  didst  not  reflect  on 
what  might  happen  and,  in  the  pride  of  thine  own  strength, 
overlooked  the  consequences.  He,  who  trusting  in  his  own 
power,  leaves  until  last  that  which  should  be  done  first  or  who 
does  first,  that  which  should  follow,  is  unable  to  distinguish 
between  what  is  wise  and  what  is  foolish.  As  offerings  poured 
into  an  unsanctified  fire  so  are  those  actions  disastrous  which 
are  performed  without  regard  to  time  and  place  or  in  opposition 
to  them.  He  goes  straight  to  the  goal,  who,  in  consultation 
with  his  ministers,  has  examined  the  three  kinds  of  action  and 
their  five  aspects1.  A  king  who  makes  his  decisions  according 
to  the  traditional  laws,  and  allows  himself  to  be  advised  by  his 
counsellors  and  consults  his  friends,  pursuing  duty,  profit  and 

1  Three  kinds  of  action — Trivial,  common  or  ordinary,  important  and 
urgent. 

Five  aspects — The  consideration  of  (a)  Time,  (b)  Place,  (e)  Oi  persona 
or  things  concerned,  {&)  Provision  against  mischance,  (e)  Consideration  of  the 
possibility  of  success.

pleasure1  at  the  proper  season  or  following  two  of  them  or  all  of 
them  combined,  is  a  wise  monarch  and  has  a  sound  under- 
standing, O  Lord  of  the  Titans. 

"  But  the  sovereign  or  heir-apparent,  who,  having  heard  what 
is  best  for  the  cultivation  of  these  three  means  and  yet  does  not 
comprehend  them,  has  spent  his  time  listening  to  instruction 
in  vain.  The  king  who  consults  his  ministers  regarding  the 
bestowal  of  gifts,  conciliation,  sowing  dissension,  taking  action 
or  uniting  himself  with  the  foe  as  also  the  consideration  of  what 
should  or  should  not  be  done  and  the  questions  of  duty,  profit 
and  pursuit  of  pleasure,  dealing  with  them  in  conformity  with 
circumstances,  and  is  master  of  himself,  is  not  visited  by  mis- 
fortune! 

"  He  verily  is  a  king,  who,  with  experienced  and  sagacious 
counsellors,  having  studied  the  advantages  he  desires  to  reap 
from  an  undertaking  and  the  wisdom  of  entering  into  it,  takes 
action. 

"  One  should  never  follow  the  advice  of  those  admitted  to 
council  who  are  not  conversant  with  the  meaning  of  the 
scriptures,  whose  intelligence  is  equal  to  the  beasts  and  who, 
in  their  conceit,  prate  continuously !  Neither  should  one  follow 
the  advice  of  those  who,  in  their  ignorance  of  the  tradition  and 
the  works  of  political  science,  merely  seek  to  amass  wealth. 
And  those  counsellors  who,  in  their  complacency,  hold  specious 
but  sinister  debates,  should  be  excluded  from  any  deliberation, 
for  they  mar  every  transaction.  Those  in  the  pay  of  well- 
informed  enemies,  who,  in  order  to  betray  their  master,  advise 
him  to  act  contrary  to  his  interests,  will  be  recognized  by  the 
king  when  they  are  in  the  assembly,  and  a  monarch  will  soon 
discover  those  who,  under  the  mask  of  devotion  hide  their 
treachery,  by  studying  their  conduct  in  their  deliberations  when 
they  are  met  together.  Those  foolish  ones,  who  rush  precipitately 
into  action  like  birds  entering  a  hole  in  the  Krauncha  Mountain, 
are  overwhelmed  by  the  enemy  and  he  who,  disregarding  the 
foe,  fails  to  protect  himself,  experiences  nothing  but  reverses 
and  loses  his  status. 

1  Duty,  profit  and  pleasure — The  Three  Ends  of  Life  should  be  pursued  in 
the  following  order : — Duty  or  devotion  in  the  morning,  profit  or  affairs  in 
the  afternoon  and  the  pursuit  of  pleasure  in  the  evening. 

167 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"The  advice  that  the  beloved  Mandodari  and  my  younger 
brother,  Bibishana,  formerly  gave  thee,  I  now  repeat  for  thine 
own  good ;  do  what  thou  considerest  best !  " 

Hearing  Kumbhakarna's  words,  Dashagriva  frowned  and 
replied  angrily : — 

"  One  should  pay  the  same  respect  to  one's  elder  brother 
as  to  one's  spiritual  preceptor !  Of  what  interest  to  me  are 
thy  counsels  ?  Why  fatigue  thyself?  Consider  what  is  fitting 
at  the  moment ;  whatever  has  impeded  success,  whether  it  has 
been  folly  or  too  great  a  confidence  in  the  strength  of  mine  army, 
it  is  useless  to  discuss  it  now !  Advise  me  as  to  what  should  be 
done  in  the  present  circumstances.  Let  thy  valour  remedy  the 
evil  that  mine  imprudence  has  brought  about  if  thou  art  truly 
devoted  to  me  and  hast  confidence  in  thine  own  prowess  and 
if  thine  heart  is  in  this  great  struggle  and  thou  considerest  it 
to  be  of  supreme  moment.  He  is  a  friend  who  rescues  one  in 
distress ;  a  kinsman  he,  who  helps  one  who  has  failed." 

Thus  spoke  Ravana  in  imperious  and  harsh  accents  and 
Kumbhakarna  reflecting  within  himself  '  he  is  enraged ', 
answered  him  mildly  in  soothing  tones,  Looking  fixedly  at 
his  brother,  whose  mind  was  agitated,  he  spoke  comforting 
words  to  him  in  a  quiet  voice,  saying : — 

"  Listen  carefully,  O  King,  O  Scourge  of  Thy  Foes,  O 
Leader  of  the  Titan  Princes,  banish  thy  grief,  renounce  thine 
anger  and  be  thyself  again !  There  is  no  reason  for  thine 
heart  to  be  troubled  as  long  as  I  live,  O  Lord !  I  will  slay  him 
who  is  the  cause  of  thy  distress  but,  in  any  circumstances,  I 
had,  of  necessity,  to  speak  for  thine  own  good  because  of 
kinship  and  brotherly  affection  for  thee,  O  Monarch. 

"  It  is  on  account  of  this  that  I  will  show  myself  to  be  a  friend 
and  a  brother  and,  in  combat,  annihilate  the  enemy  under  thine 
eyes.  To-day,  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  thou  shalt  see  me  in  the 
forefront  of  battle,  having  slain  Rama  and  his  brother  and  put 
the  monkey  army  to  flight.  Seeing  me  bring  back  Rama's  head 
from  the  battlefield  this  day,  thou  wilt  be  happy,  O  Warrior,  and 
Sita  overwhelmed  with  despair. 

"  T  o-day  all  the  titans  of  Lanka,  whose  kinsfolk  have  perished, 
will  witness  the  death  of  Rama  who  is  the  object  of  men's 
desires !  By  striking  down  the  foe  in  battle,  I  shall  dry  the 
1 68 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

tears  of  those  who  are  overcome  with  sorrow  and  have  been 
rendered  desolate  by  the  loss  of  their  relatives.  To-day  thou 
shalt  see  Sugriva,  the  leader  of  the  Plavagas,  who  resembles  a 
mountain  illumined  by  the  sun,  lying  on  the  earth.  The  titans, 
and  I  also,  are  eager  to  slay  Dasaratha's  son ;  this  should  fill  thee 
with  confidence,  how  is  it  that  thou  art  still  trembling,  O 
Irreproachable  Hero?  Should  he  slay  me,  Raghava  will 
assuredly  slay  thee  also  but  I  have  nothing  to  fear,  O  Lord  of  the 
Titans  1  Now  command  me,  O  Scourge  of  Thy  Foes,  do  not 
seek  another  for  this  encounter,  O  Incomparable  Hero  !  I  shall 
destroy  thy  foes  despite  their  strength !  Even  were  it  Shakra 
or  Yama  or  Pavaka  or  Maruta,  I  should  enter  into  combat  with 
them  or  with  Kuvera  or  Varuna  themselves ;  I,  who  in  stature 
am  like  unto  a  mountain,  with  a  sharpened  spear  as  my  weapon, 
my  war-cry,  my  pointed  teeth,  at  the  sight  of  which  Purandara 
himself  trembles,  throwing  away  my  arms,  shall  strike  down  the 
foe  with  blows  of  my  fists.  None  will  be  able  to  withstand  me, 
no  matter  how  much  they  may  cling  to  life,  nor  have  I  need  of 
lance,  mace,  sword  or  whetted  dart ;  with  my  bare  hands  alone, 
I  will  kill  Raghava,  were  he  accompanied  by  the  God  who  bears 
the  Thunderbolt  himself !  If  he  is  able  to  withstand  the  force 
of  my  fists  then  mine  arrows  will  drink  his  life's  blood !  O 
King,  I  stand  here,  why  art  thou  overwhelmed  with  despair  ? 
Here  I  wait  ready  to  exterminate  the  slayers  of  titans,  by  whom 
Lanka  has  been  set  on  fire,  and  also  the  monkeys,  in  the  struggle 
that  is  about  to  take  place.  I  shall  confer  a  rare  and  great  glory 
upon  thee !  Did  the  danger  come  from  Indra  or  Swyambhu 
or  the  Gods  themselves,  I  should  make  them  measure  their 
length  on  the  field  of  battle,  O  King  !  I  shall  overcome  Yama, 
consume  Pavaka,  hurl  down  Varuna,  pulverize  the  mountains 
and  shatter  the  earth !  After  my  long  sleep,  let  those  beings 
I  am  about  to  consume,  witness  the  prowess  of  Kumbhakarna 
this  day  !  Nay,  the  Three  Worlds  shall  not  be  able  to  glut  mine 
appetite !  In  order  to  please  thee  I  will  slay  the  son  of  Dasaratha! 
Having  struck  down  Rama  and  Laksjhmana,  I  shall  devour  all 
the  foremost  of  the  monkey  leaders.  Rejoice  therefore,  O  King 
and  drink  wine,  do  what  thou  hast  to  do  and  banish  grief; 
to-day  I  shall  send  Rama  to  the  abode  of  death  and  Sita  will 
become  thine  for  ever !  "

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    64 

Mahodara's  Speech 

Hearing  this  speech  of  the  colossal  and  valiant  Kumbhakama, 
Mahodara  replied : — 

"  Kumbhakama,  thou  art  an  offshoot  of  an  illustrious  race, 
thou  an  courageous  but  thou  hast  two  vulgar  characteristics 
and,  in  thy  conceit,  art  unable  to  anticipate  the  course  of  events 
in  all  its  aspects. 

"  It  is  not  true  that  the  king  does  not  understand  what  is 
politic  and  impolitic,  O  Kumbhakama,  but  thou,  in  thy  youthful 
impetuosity,  knowest  only  how  to  prate !  The  Lord  of  the 
Titans,  who  is  conversant  with  the  laws  of  time  and  place,  is 
also  aware  of  increase  and  loss  as  well  as  our  situation  and  the 
state  of  the  enemy. 

"  What  man  of  sense  would  attempt  that  which  an  old  thick- 
headed soldier  with  no  respect  even  for  his  elders  plumes  himself 
on  accomplishing  ?  When  thou  dost  assert  that  duty,  profit 
and  pleasure  are  essentially  opposed  to  each  other,  it  is  a  proof 
that  thou  art  unaware  of  their  real  nature.  Action  is  un- 
doubtedly the  source  of  all  experiences  and  here  below, 
happiness  is  the  fruit  we  seek  even  in  our  most  evil  acts.  Apart 
from  pleasure,  duty  and  profit  yield  felicity,  but  the  fruit  reaped 
from  injustice  and  unrighteousness  is  calamitous.  Men  of 
strong  character  undertake  those  acts,  the  consequences  of  which 
they  reap  in  another  world,  whilst  those  who  give  themselves 
up  to  the  pursuit  of  pleasure  reap  the  consequences  here. 

"  Why  should  that  which  the  king  has  so  much  at  heart  and 
which  we  approve,  namely  the  chastising  of  his  enemies,  be  set 
aside  in  any  way?  As  for  the  motives  thou  hast  given  for 
marching  against  Rama  single-handed,  I  will  point  out  to  thee 
what  is  ill-considered  and  reprehensible  about  them!  How 
canst  thou  defeat  Rama  alone,  he  who  formerly  destroyed 
innumerable  exceedingly  powerful  titans  in  Janasthana  ?  Those 
rangers  of  the  night  whom  he  overcame  in  Janasthana  were 
valiant  warriors  also  and  dost  thou  not  behold  them  in  the  city, 
170 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

stricken  with  fear  ?  By  rousing  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha, 
who  resembles  a  wounded  lion,  alas  thou  art  waking  a  sleeping 
serpent !  Burning  with  valour  and  unapproachable  in  his  fury, 
inaccessible  as  Mrityu,  who  would  dare  to  challenge  him  ?  This 
entire  army  cannot  face  that  foe  without  being  imperilled, 
therefore  it  in  no  wise  recommends  itself  to  me  that  thou 
shouldst  go  out  to  meet  him  alone,  O  Child.  Who,  bereft  of 
resources  would  be  eager  to  meet  with  an  adversary,  ready  to 
sacrifice  his  life  and  furnished  with  every  pre-requisite  !  Rama 
has  no  equal  among  men,  O  Best  of  the  Titans,  how  canst  thou 
plume  thyself  on  entering  into  combat  with  him  who  is  the 
rival  of  Indra  and  Vaivasvata  ?  " 

Having  spoken  thus  to  the  enraged  Kumbhakarna,  Mahodara 
said  to  Ravana,  the  Destroyer  of  the  Worlds,  who  was  surrounded 
by  the  titans  : — 

"  Having  formerly  borne  Vaidehi  away,  why  dost  thou  delay  ? 
If  thou  desirest  Sita  to  submit  to  thy  will,  I  see  a  means  of 
bringing  her  to  thy  feet.  If  it  pleases  thee,  O  Indra  among  the 
Titans,  then  hear  me  ! 

"  Let  it  be  proclaimed  that  I,  Dvijihva,  Samhradin, 
Kumbhakarna  and  Vitadarna,  all  five,  are  going  forth  to  slay 
Rama  !  We  shall  engage  him  in  a  fierce  struggle  and,  if  we 
triumph  over  thine  enemy,  we  need  resort  to  no  other  means, 
but,  if  thy  rival  survive  and  we  escape  from  the  fight,  then  we 
will  adopt  the  measures  I  have  planned. 

"  We  shall  return  from  the  battlefield  and  come  hither 
covered  with  blood,  our  limbs  pierced  by  darts  on  which  are 
engraved  Rama's  name,  and  relate  how  we  have  destroyed 
Raghava  and  Lakshmana !  Thereafter  we  shall  press  thy  feet 
and  thou  wilt  cover  us  with  honour,  after  which,  mounted  on 
an  elephant  thou  wilt  publish  the  tidings  throughout  the  city, 
relating  how  Rama,  his  brother  and  his  army  were  entirely 
destroyed.  Simulating  an  extreme  satisfaction,  O  Subduer 
of  Thy  Foes,  thou  wilt  promote  feasting  and  rejoicing  and 
bestow  gold  and  slaves  on  thy  servants  and  distribute  garlands, 
raiment  and  perfumes  on  thy  warriors,  thou  thyself  manifesting 
thy  delight  by  drinking.  Thereupon  a  rumour  will  spread 
everywhere  that  Rama  and  his  friends  have  been  devoured  by 
the  titans  ;  such  will  be  the  report !

"  Then  shalt  thou  repair  secretly  to  where  Sita  is,  in  order 

to  offer  her  consolation  and  tempt  her  with  grain,  diamonds  and 
entertainment  in  order  to  seduce  her.  By  this  deceit,  O  King, 
Site's  grief  will  be  increased  and  she,  bereft  of  felicity,  without 
a  protector,  will  accede  to  thy  desire.  Learning  that  her 
charming  lord  is  slain,  Sita,  in  despair  and  on  account  of  womanly 
frailty,  will  submit  to  thy  will ! 

"  Brought  up  in  the  lap  of  prosperity,  this  woman  who  is 
worthy  of  felicity  and  who  is  afflicted  with  misfortune,  realising 
her  happiness  depends  on  thee,  will  surrender  herself  wholly 
to  thee. 

"  This  is  the  best  course  for  thee  to  follow.  Even  to  behold 
Rama  may  prove  disastrous ;  have  no  anxiety !  Great  happiness 
awaits  thee  here  without  entering  into  combat !  Neither 
losing  thy  forces  nor  courting  danger,  triumph  over  thine 
enemy,  O  Monarch !  Glory,  felicity,  prosperity  and  renown 
will  long  be  the  lot  of  thy  sovereign  majesty !  " 


chapter  65 

Kumbhakarna  enters  into  Combat 

Replying  to  Mahodara's  reproaches,  Kumbhakarna  said  to  his 
brother,  Ravana,  the  King  of  the  Titans : — 

"  Forsooth  I  shall  dispel  the  immediate  peril  this  day  by 
slaying  that  wretch,  Rama !  Freed  from  thine  adversary,  be 
happy !  Heroes  do  not  thunder  in  vain  like  clouds  bereft  of 
rain !  Do  thou  mark  how  my  threats  find  fulfilment  in  mine 
exploits !  Warriors  do  not  need  to  boast,  and  accomplish  the 
most  difficult  of  feats  without  bluster !  Cowardly  monarchs, 
devoid  of  intelligence,  who  plume  themselves  on  being  wise, 
will  ever  find  thy  speech  acceptable,  O  Mahodara  ! 

"  All  you  effeminate  creatures,  agreeable  talkers,  who  flatter 
the  king,  have  always  ruined  any  martial  enterprise.  Nothing 
is  left  in  Lanka  save  its  sovereign ;  its  wealth  is  exhausted,  its 
army  destroyed  and  that  monarch  is  beset  by  foes  in  the  guise 
of  friends !  I  shall  go  out  and  fight,  determined  to  triumph 
172 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

over  the  foe  and,  in  this  wise,  redeem  thy  calamitous  policy 
in  this  great  struggle." 

Hearing  these  words  of  the  intelligent  Kumbharkarna,  the 
King  of  the  Titans  answered  laughing : — 

"  In  sooth,  Rama  has  terrorized  Mahodara  !  Assuredly  he 
does  not  relish  battle,  O  Dear  Friend  !  O  Sagacious  Warrior,  I 
have  none  equal  to  thee  in  devotion  and  prowess ;  go,  slay  mine 
adversary,  O  Kumbhakarna  and  speed  towards  victory  ! 

"  Thou  wast  sleeping  and  it  was  for  mine  enemy's  destruction 
that  I  had  thee  wakened ;  this  hour  is  of  extreme  significance 
to  the  titans,  O  Vanquisher  of  thy  Foes !  Go,  arm  thyself; 
let  those  two  princes,  the  equals  of  Aditya  in  splendour,  be 
thy  pasture !  Beholding  thee,  the  monkeys  will  take  to  flight 
and  the  hearts  of  Rama  and  Lakshmana  will  cease  to  beat." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  the  exceedingly  powerful  Kumbhakarna, 
that  illustrious  lion  of  the  titans  felt  he  had  received  new  life. 
Aware  of  Kumbhakarna's  prowess  and  knowing  his  valour, 
the  king  expanded  with  joy  like  unto  the  immaculate  moon. 

Hearing  bis  words,  which  filled  him  with  delight,  that  warrior 
went  away  and,  having  listened  to  the  king's  speech,  prepared 
for  battle.  Then  that  scourge  of  his  foes  vigorously  brandished 
his  iron  spear  decorated  with  fine  gold  that  shone  brightly  and 
was  as  renowned  as  Indra's  thunderbolt  and  equally  heavy. 
The  scourge  of  the  Devas,  Danavas,  Gandharvas,  Yakshas  and 
Pannagas,  wreathed  in  garlands,  festooned  with  crimson 
Sowers,  emitting  flames,  that  great  spear,  stained  with  the  blood 
of  bis  enemies,  was  taken  up  by  the  illustrious  Kumbhakarna, 
who  addressed  Ravana,  saying : — 

"  I  shall  set  out  alone ;  let  thy  powerful  army  remain  here  ! 
To-day  in  mine  hunger  and  fury,  I  shall  devour  the  monkeys !  " 

At  these  words  of  Kumbhakarna,  Ravana  answered  : — 

"  Do  thou  go  out  accompanied  by  troops  furnished  with 
picks  and  hammers ;  those  monkeys  are  brave  and  exceedingly 
energetic !  He  who  is  rash  enough  to  meet  them  alone  will  be 
torn  to  pieces  by  their  teeth,  yet,  though  they  are  extremely 
difficult  to  overcome,  surround  thyself  with  warriors  and  setting 
out,  utterly  destroy  that  enemy  host  so  fatal  to  the  titans ! " 

Thereafter,  descending  from  the  throne,  the  mighty  Ravana 
placed  a  diadem,  the  interior  of  which  was  encrusted  with 
173 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

pearls,  on  Kumbhakarna's  brow  and  decked  out  that  hero  with 
bracelets,  rings,  precious  gems  and  a  necklace  as  bright  as  the 
moon,  covering  his  limbs  with  celestial  and  fragrant  garlands 
and  setting  earrings  in  his  ears.  With  the  bracelets,  anklets 
and  golden  coins1,  with  which  he  was  adorned,  the  large-eyed 
Kumbhakarna  shone  like  the  sacrificial  fire. 

Resplendent  with  his  great  dark-blue  girdle,  he  resembled 
the  Mandara  Mountain  encircled  by  the  snake  at  the  time  of 
the  churning  of  the  water  of  immortality.  Clad  in  golden 
armour  that  no  arrow  could  penetrate,  which  in  its  natural 
brilliance  seemed  to  project  flames,  he  was  rendered  as  radiant 
as  the  King  of  the  Mountains  encircled  by  evening  clouds. 
His  entire  body  was  covered  with  ornaments  of  every  kind  and, 
spear  in  hand,  that  titan  called  to  mind  Narayana,  when,  in 
his  might,  he  took  the  three  strides. 

Thereafter  that  warrior  embraced  his  brother  and  paid 
obeisance  to  him  by  circumambulating  him  in  the  traditional 
manner  and,  inclining  his  head  to  him,  set  out  to  the  sound  of 
conches  and  gongs. 

Then  Ravana,  dismissing  him  with  good  wishes,  caused  an 
escort  of  well-equipped  soldiers  to  accompany  him  with 
elephants,  horses  and  chariots,  emitting  a  sound  like  thunder- 
clouds. Valiant  fighters  accompanied  that  prince  of  warriors 
mounted  on  serpents,  buffalo,  donkeys,  lions,  elephants 
antelopes  and  birds. 

It  was  under  a  prodigious  shower  of  blossom,  a  parasol  over 
him,  bearing  a  pointed  spear  in  bis  hand,  full  of  daring,  that  the 
enemy  of  Devas  and  Danavas,  intoxicated  with  the  smell  of 
blood,  set  forth.  And  innumerable  titans  followed  him  on  foot, 
full  of  energy  and  prowess,  fierce  of  aspect,  bearing  weapons  in 
their  hands,  their  eyes  red ;  and  their  ranks  measured  many 
leagues  in  extent  and  they  resembled  heaps  of  antimony  and 
brandished  maces,  swords,  sharp  axes,  javelins,  bars,  ramrods, 
hammers,  great  Sala  Trees  and  were  furnished  with  nets. 

Meanwhile  Kumbhakarna,  assuming  another  terrible  and 
ferocious  form,  advanced  impetuously,  measuring  a  hundred 
bows  in  breadth  and  six  hundred  in  height,  formidable,  full  of 
power  and  energy  with  eyes  like  unto  chariot  wheels.    And, 

1  Lit.  Mishkas — See  glossary. 

174 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

having  assembled  the  titans,  that  colossus  with  his  large  mouth, 
who  looked  like  a  flaming  crag  said  with  a  mocking  laugh : — 

"  To-day  the  foremost  of  the  monkey  divisions  will  be 
consumed  by  me  in  my  wrath  one  after  the  other  like  moths  in 
a  flame.  Yet  those  inhabitants  of  the  woods  have  never  given 
offence  and  their  race  adorns  the  gardens  of  our  dwellings. 

"  The  cause  of  the  city  being  beseiged  is  Raghava,  and 
Lakshmana  who  accompanies  him ;  he  being  slain,  all  will  be 
slain ;  I  shall  therefore  destroy  him  in  fight." 

At  these  words  of  Kumbhakarna,  the  titans  emitted  a  great 
shout  that  seemed  to  agitate  the  ocean. 

Then  the  crafty  Kumbhakarna  went  forth  and  sinister 
portents  appeared  on  every  side ;  dark  and  fearful  clouds 
accompanied  by  meteors  were  seen,  and  the  earth,  the  sea  and  the 
forests  trembled.  Jackals  of  ferocious  aspect,  with  flames 
darting  from  their  mouths,  began  to  howl  and  birds  wheeled 
from  left  to  right.  A  vulture  alighted  on  the  titan's  spear  as  he 
advanced,  and  his  left  eye  and  arm  twitched  ;  a  flaming  meteor 
fell  with  a  terrible  crash ;  the  sun  lost  its  brilliance  and  no 
favourable  wind  blew. 

Without  heeding  these  threatening  portents,  causing  the 
hair  to  stand  on  end,  Kumbhakarna  set  out,  urged  on  by  the 
force  of  destiny.  Having  crossed  the  ramparts,  that  giant, 
equal  to  a  mountain,  beheld  the  vast  army  of  the  monkeys 
resembling  a  cloud  and,  seeing  that  most  powerful  of  the  titans, 
as  high  as  a  mountain,  those  monkeys  fled  in  all  directions,  like 
clouds  driven  before  the  wind.  At  the  sight  of  that  tremendous 
host  of  monkeys  scattering  to  the  four  quarters  like  a  mass  of 
cloud  melting  away,  Kumbhakarna  joyfully  redoubled  his 
shouts  resembling  thunder. 

Hearing  those  terrible  shouts,  like  unto  the  roar  of  clouds  in 
the  sky,  countless  Plavagas  fell  to  the  earth  like  great  Sala  Trees 
whose  roots  have  been  severed  and,  as  Kumbhakarna  hurled 
himself  on  the  enemy  with  his  huge  mace  in  order  to  destroy 
him,  he  filled  the  ranks  of  the  monkeys  with  extreme  fear  as 
does  the  Lord  of  Death  accompanied  by  his  minions  at  the  end 
of  the  World  Period. 


175 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    66 

Angada  reproaches  the  Monkeys  for  flying  from  Kumbhakarna 

Having  leapt  over  the  wall,  Kumbhakarna,  that  giant,  like  unto 
the  peak  of  a  mountain,  full  of  valour,  set  out  from  the  city  in 
haste  and  emitted  a  great  shout  which  agitated  the  waters, 
drowned  the  thunder  claps  and  appeared  to  shatter  the 
mountains. 

Seeing  that  warrior  of  fierce  glance,  as  invincible  as  Maghavat, 
Yama  or  Varuna,  the  monkeys  stampeded,  and  Prince  Angada, 
beholding  them  fleeing,  addressed  the  mighty  Nala,  Nila, 
Gavaksha  and  Kumuda,  saying  : — 

"  Forgetting  your  native  valour  and  noble  lineage,  where  are 
you  fleeing  in  terror  like  common  monkeys  ?  Come  back,  O 
Companions,  return !  Is  it  thus  that  you  defend  your  lives  ? 
Nay,  this  titan  is  not  able  to  tight  against  you  all ;  he  is  here  to 
create  panic  amongst  you.  This  great  fear,  that  the  titan 
inspires  in  you,  will  be  dispelled  by  our  prowess ;  return,  O 
Flavamgamas ! " 

Rallied  with  difficulty  from  here  and  there  and  re-assured, 
those  monkeys,  armed  with  trees,  halted  in  the  field,  and  those 
dwellers  in  the  woods  stayed  there  ready  to  advance  in  fury  on 
Kumbhakarna,  like  elephants  intoxicated  with  Mada  juice. 
Thereafter  they  attacked  him  valiantly  with  blows  from  mountain 
peaks,  rocks  and  trees  with  their  flowering  crests  but  were 
unable  to  overthrow  him.  Innumerable  stones,  and  trees  with 
blossoming  tops  fell  shattered  on  the  earth,  having  come  in 
contact  with  his  limbs  and  that  hero,  enraged,  on  his  side, 
struck  down  the  ranks  of  those  energetic  monkeys  by  exercising 
bis  great  strength,  like  unto  a  fire  which  suddenly  blazes  forth 
in  the  forest.  Their  limbs  be-spattered  with  blood,  those  lions 
among  the  monkeys,  overcome  and  cut  down,  lay  there  in  great 
numbers  resembling  trees  with  coppery  flowers.  Thereafter, 
those  monkeys  bounded  away  without  looking  in  which  direction 
and  some  threw  themselves  into  the  sea  and  some  leapt  into  the 
176 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

air.  Overcome  by  that  titan,  who  was  disporting  himself, 
some,  despite  their  valour,  fled  over  the  sea  by  the  way  by  which 
they  had  come  and  some,  pale  and  distraught,  escaped  to  the 
valleys.  The  bears  climbed  into  the  trees  and  some  took 
refuge  in  the  mountains ;  others  being  no  longer  able  to  stand, 
fell  down  and  remained  lying  on  the  earth  insensible  as  if  asleep 
or  dead. 

Seeing  the  monkeys  routed,  Angada  called  out  to  them : — 

"  Stay  !  Let  us  fight !  Return,  O  Plavamgamas  !  Were  you  to 
range  the  whole  earth  in  your  flight  I  see  no  refuge  for  you 
anywhere  I  Why  do  you  seek  to  preserve  your  lives  ?  If  you 
fly,  leaving  your  weapons,  lest  they  impede  your  course,  your 
wives  will  deride  you  for  this  cowardice,  which  is  death  to  men 
of  honour,  O  Warriors !  Whither  are  you  fleeing  filled  with 
fear  like  common  monkeys,  you  who  are  born  in  rich  and 
illustrious  families?  Where  are  those  deeds  of  valour  and 
prowess  of  which  you  boasted  in  the  assembly  ?  The  reproach 
of  cowardice  will  be  heard  by  you ;  he,  who  seeks  to  save  his 
life  by  fleeing,  is  despised  !  Follow  the  path  chosen  by  men 
of  courage  and  overcome  your  fears.  If,  after  a  brief  existence, 
you  lie  stretched  on  the  earth  dead,  you  will  attain  Brahmaloka, 
inaccessible  to  cowards.  We  shall  acquire  glory  by  striking 
down  the  foe  in  fight  and,  if  we  succumb,  we  shall  enjoy  the 
treasures  of  heaven  in  the  region  of  heroes,  O  Monkeys  !  Nay, 
Kumbhakarna  will  never  return  alive,  having  come  before 
Kakutstha,  as  a  moth  that  draws  near  to  a  glowing  brazier. 
If  one,  despite  our  numbers,  is  able  to  disperse  us  and  we 
preserve  our  lives  by  fleeing,  then  there  is  an  end  to  our 
renown ! " 

Such  was  Angada's  speech,  he  of  the  golden  bracelets,  and  the 
fugitives  replied  to  that  hero's  reproaches,  saying : — 

"  That  Titan  Kumbhakarna,  has  caused  a  terrible  carnage 
amongst  us  ;  it  is  not  the  moment  to  stay ;  life  is  dear  to  us  !  " 

With  these  words  the  leaders  of  the  monkeys,  beholding  that 
giant  of  fearful  glance  advancing,  scattered  in  all  directions. 

Nevertheless  Angada,  by  his  exhortations  and  arguments, 
succeeded  in  rallying  them  and,  re-assured  by  that  sagacious 
son  of  Bali,  they  submitted  to  his  commands  and  those  foremost 
of  monkeys  returned  to  the  field. 
177 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    67 

Kumbhakarna' s  Exploits.   He  is  slain  by  Rama 

Retracing  their  steps  on  hearing  the  voice  of  Angada,  all  those 
huge-bodied  monkeys,  resolutely  taking  their  stand,  desired 
nothing  more  than  to  join  issue  in  the  fight. 

Their  confidence  restored  by  the  words  of  the  valiant  Angada, 
those  monkeys,  feeling  their  energy  revived  and  their  courage 
mounting,  advanced,  resolving  to  die  and  sacrifice  their  lives. 
Then  those  giants,  arming  themselves  with  trees  and  enormous 
crags,  which  they  spun  with  great  rapidity,  hurled  themselves 
on  Kumbhakarna,  whereupon,  full  of  ire  and  vigour,  that 
warrior  of  immense  stature,  brandishing  his  mace,  dispersed 
the  enemy  on  every  side.  Seven  hundred  and  eight  thousand 
monkeys  lay  scattered  on  the  earth  struck  down  by 
Kumbhakarna  and,  like  unto  Garuda  consuming  serpents,  he 
seized  hold  of  seven,  eight,  ten,  twenty  and  thirty  in  his  arms, 
crushing  and  devouring  them  in  his  extreme  fury  as  he  ran. 

Re-assured  with  exceeding  difficulty,  those  monkeys  rallied 
here  and  there  and,  armed  with  trees  and  rocks,  took  up  their 
stand  in  the  forefront  of  the  battle.  At  that  instant,  Dvivida, 
that  lion  among  monkeys,  resembling  a  threatening  cloud, 
tearing  up  a  rock,  hurled  himself  on  the  enemy  who  was  like 
unto  a  mountain  peak ;  and  that  monkey,  breaking  off  the  crag, 
flung  it  at  Kumbhakarna,  missing  him,  so  that  the  missile  fell 
on  the  titan  force,  crushing  horses,  elephants  and  chariots 
harnessed  to  excellent  steeds.  Another  rock  created  further 
victims  and,  under  that  avalanche  of  stones,  the  titans  wounded, 
their  horses  slain,  their  charioteers  struck  down,  streaming  with 
blood  and  mounted  in  then  cars,  suddenly  let  forth  terrible 
cries  and  with  the  aid  of  death-dealing  arrows,  severed  the  heads 
of  those  foremost  of  monkeys  who  were  roaring. 

On  their  side,  the  monkeys,  full  of  valour,  uprooted  great 
trees  in  order  to  crush  the  chariots,  horses,  elephants,  buffalo 
and  titans  and,  from  the  air  where  he  was  stationed,  Hanuman 
178 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

showered  rocks,  stones  and  trees  of  every  kind  on  the  head  of 
Kumbhakarna  but  that  mighty  one  split  and  evaded  that  rain 
of  trees.  And  he  hurled  himself  upon  that  great  army  of 
monkeys  brandishing  his  sharp  pick  and,  as  he  rushed  forward 
Hanuman  placed  himself  in  the  way  armed  with  the  peak  of  a 
mountain,  and,  in  fury  struck  Kumbhakarna  a  violent  blow, 
who,  in  his  appalling  corpulence,  appeared  like  a  hill !  Then 
he  whose  limbs  were  dripping  with  fat  and  streaming  with 
blood,  stumbled  under  the  shock  and  the  titan  hurled  his  spear, 
which  was  as  bright  as  lightning  and  like  a  mountain  spouting 
forth  flames,  striking  Maruti  between  the  arms,  as  Guha 
formerly  struck  the  Krauncha  Mountain  with  his  formidable 
lance.  His  breast  pierced  by  that  spear,  beside  himself, 
vomiting  blood,  Hanuman,  in  fury,  let  forth  a  terrible  cry  in 
the  midst  of  the  battle,  like  the  roar  of  a  thundercloud  at  the 
end  of  the  World  Period,  and  a  great  cheer  arose  from  the  ranks 
of  the  titans  as  they  beheld  his  plight,  whilst  the  monkeys, 
distraught  and  terrified,  fled  from  the  field. 

At  that  instant,  summoning  up  his  courage,  the  valiant  Nila 
discharged  a  crag  against  that  crafty  titan,  who,  seeing  it 
approaching,  struck  it  with  his  fist  and,  on  the  impact,  that  rock 
broke  and  fell  on  the  earth  emitting  sparks  of  fire.  Then 
Rishabha,  Sharabha,  Nila,  Gavaksha  and  Gandamadhana, 
those  five  tigers  among  the  monkeys,  hurled  themselves  on 
Kumbhakarna  and,  in  the  struggle,  showered  him  with  blows 
from  stones,  trees,  the  palms  of  their  hands,  feet  and  fists, 
attacking  that  giant  on  every  side.  Kumbhakarna,  however, 
scarcely  felt  those  blows  and,  unheeding,  seized  the  impetuous 
Rishabha  in  his  two  arms.  Crashed  in  this  embrace,  that  bull 
among  the  monkeys  fell  to  the  ground,  his  mouth  filled  with 
blood. 

Thereafter,  in  the  fight,  that  enemy  of  Indra  struck  Sharabha 
with  his  fist,  Nila  with  his  knee  and  Gavaksha  with  the  palm 
of  his  hand.  Dazed  by  the  blows  they  had  received,  terrified, 
covered  with  blood,  they  fell  on  the  earth  like  Kimshuka  Trees 
that  have  been  uprooted.  Those  powerful  leaders  of  the 
monkeys  being  overcome,  the  rest  hurled  themselves  in  thousands 
on  Kumbhakarna  and,  flinging  themselves  upon  him  and 
climbing  about  aim  as  if  he  were  a  rock,  those  bulls  among  the 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Plavagas,  who  themselves  resembled  hills,  attacked  and  bit  him. 
With  their  nails,  teeth,  fists  and  arms,  those  foremost  of  monkeys 
assailed  the  valiant  Kumbhakama,  a  veritable  tiger  in  stature, 
and  that  titan,  covered  by  thousands  of  apes,  resembled  a 
mountain  overgrown  by  trees.  Crushing  all  those  monkeys  in 
his  arms,  that  giant  devoured  them,  as  Garuda  the  serpents. 
Cast  into  Kumbhakarna's  mouth,  that  resembled  the  pit  of  hell, 
the  monkeys  issued  from  his  ears  and  nostrils.  As  high  as  a 
mountain  in  his  rage  he  devoured  those  monkeys,  and  that 
prince  of  titans  crushed  them  covering  the  earth  with  their 
flesh  and  blood  and  ranging  through  their  ranks  which  he 
overran,  so  that  he  appeared  like  the  Fire  of  Time  itself. 
Resembling  Shakra  bearing  the  thunderbolt  in  his  hand  or  Death 
with  the  noose,  so  did  that  powerful  titan  appear,  armed  with 
his  spear,  in  the  fight.  As  in  the  summer  season,  fire  destroys 
the  dry  forests,  so  did  Kumbhakama  consume  the  simian 
ranks. 

Thus  decimated,  their  leaders  struck  down,  the  Plavamgamas, 
wild  with  terror,  emitted  dreadful  cries  and,  overpowered  again 
and  again  by  Kumbhakama,  those  monkeys  fled  for  refuge  to 
Ragbava.  Witnessing  the  massacre  of  those  monkeys,  Angada, 
bom  of  the  son  of  the  Bearer  of  the  Thunderbolt,  hurled 
himself  in  rage  upon  Kumbhakama  in  the  struggle.  Seizing 
hold  of  a  great  crag,  he  roared  again  and  again,  putting  all  the 
titans,  who  accompanied  Kumbhakama,  to  flight ;  thereafter  he 
struck  the  head  of  his  adversary  with  the  rock,  and  that  enemy 
of  Indra  inflamed  with  anger  on  receiving  the  blow,  leapt  with 
one  bound  upon  the  irascible  son  of  Bali.  Emitting  loud  cries, 
that  titan  struck  terror  among  the  monkeys  and,  in  his  anger, 
threw  his  spear  with  extreme  force  at  Angada,  but  with  a  light 
bound,  that  valiant  lion  among  the  monkeys,  an  experienced 
warrior,  avoided  the  impact  and  leapt  on  his  opponent,  striking 
his  chest  with  the  palm  of  his  hand.  That  violent  blow  dazed 
the  giant,  who  resembled  a  mountain,  but  regaining  his  senses 
that  most  powerful  of  titans,  doubling  his  fist,  with  a  mocking 
laugh,  struck,  Angada  who  fell  insensible  to  the  earth. 

As  that  lion  among  the  Plavagas  lay  stretched  unconscious 
on  the  ground,  Kumbhakama,  brandishing  his  spear,  rushed  on 
Sugriva  and,  seeing  that  colossus  running  towards  him,  the 
1 80 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

courageous  King  of  the  Monkeys  went  out  to  meet  him  where- 
upon, beholding  that  Indra  among  the  Monkeys  advancing, 
Kumbhakarna  halted  and  stood  facing  him  with  braced  limbs. 

Beholding  Kumbhakarna  standing  still,  bis  body  streaming 
with  the  blood  of  the  great  monkeys  whom  he  had  devoured, 
Sugriva  said  to  him : — 

"  In  slaying  these  warriors  thou  hast  accomplished  a  most 
difficult  feat  and,  by  devouring  my  soldiers,  hast  acquired 
immense  renown ;  now  let  the  army  of  monkeys  be,  what  hast 
thou  to  do  with  common  folk  ?  Do  thou  seek  to  bear  the  weight 
of  this  rock  I  am  about  to  hurl  on  thee,  O  Titan  !  Find  thy 
satisfaction  in  slaying  me,  O  Titan,  thou  who  resemblest  a 
mountain ! '* 

At  these  words  of  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  who  was  possessed 
of  courage  and  fortitude,  that  lion  among  the  titans,  answered : — 

**  Thou  art  the  grandson  of  Prajapati  and  the  son  of 
Riksharajas,  thou  art  energetic  and  brave,  hence  thine  arrogance, 
O  Monkey ! " 

At  these  words  of  Kumbhakarna,  Sugriva,  taking  up  a  stone, 
hurled  it  at  him  suddenly  and  struck  his  breast  with  that  missile 
resembling  a  thunderbolt.  The  rock  broke  on  the  huge  chest 
of  that  giant  and  the  titans  were  appalled,  whilst  from  the  ranks 
of  the  monkeys  rose  shouts  of  joy.  Struck  by  that  rocky  peak, 
Kumbhakarna,  enraged,  roared ;  opening  bis  huge  mouth  wide 
and  brandishing  his  spear,  that  resembled  lightning,  he  hurled 
it  at  the  King  of  the  Monkeys  and  the  Bears  in  order  to  slay 
him.  As  it  fell,  the  son  of  Anila,  Hanuman,  with  his  two  hands 
seized  hold  of  that  sharp  spear  and  its  gold-encircled  shaft 
loosed  by  the  titan's  arm  and,  in  play  as  it  were,  broke  that 
powerful  weapon  across  his  knee. 

Seeing  his  lance  shattered  to  pieces  by  Hanuman,  the  army 
of  monkeys,  in  a  transport  of  delight,  began  to  cheer.  Meanwhile 
hearing  those  rangers  of  the  woods  emitting  leonine  roars  and 
lauding  Maruti  in  their  joy,  on  beholding  his  spear  shattered, 
that  titan  became  enraged  and,  pale  with  fear,  tore  oft  a  peak 
of  the  Malaya  Mountain  nearby,  in  the  vicinity  of  Lanka, 
hurling  it  on  Sugriva  in  order  to  strike  him  down.  Struck  by 
that  crag,  the  Indra  of  the  Monkeys  fell  on  the  earth  insensible 
and  the  Yatudhanas  let  forth  a  roar  of  triumph.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Thereafter  Kumbhakarna,  approaching  that  powerful  King 
of  the  Monkeys,  lifted  him  up  and  bore  him  away  like  unto  a 
violent  wind  driving  away  a  cloud  and,  as  he  ranged  the  battle- 
field dragging  Sugriva  with  him,  who  resembled  a  great  cloud, 
Kumbhakarna,  with  his  lofty  stature,  appeared  like  Mount 
Meru  of  exceedingly  high  peaks.  Having  laid  hold  of  Sugriva, 
the  mighty  Lord  of  the  Titans  turned  towards  Lanka  amidst  the 
acclamations  of  his  own  people  and  the  wailing  of  the  Inhabitants 
of  the  Celestial  Region,  who  were  inconsolable  on  account  of  the 
capture  of  the  King  of  the  Plavamgamas  and,  having  overcome 
the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  that  enemy  of  Indra  and  his  rival  in 
power,  reflected : — '  He  being  dead,  the  entire  simian  host  is 
destroyed  together  with  Raghava !  * 

Then  Hanuman,  the  sagacious  son  of  Maruta,  seeing  Sugriva 
borne  away  by  Kumbhakarna  and  the  monkeys  fleeing,  thought 
to  himself:  *Now  that  Sugriva  has  been  made  captive  what 
ought  I  to  do?  Assuredly  I  shall  accomplish  that  which  is 
fitting ;  in  order  to  slay  this  titan,  I  shall  assume  the  shape  of  a 
mountain !  When  I  have  destroyed  the  extremely  powerful 
Kumbhakarna  in  combat  by  pounding  his  body  with  blows  and 
have  delivered  the  king,  die  delight  of  the  monkeys  will  be 
general !  Yet  that  great  monkey  is  well  able  to  free  himself 
though  meseems,  that,  struck  by  Kumbhakarna  with  a  rock  in 
the  struggle,  the  Chief  of  the  Monkeys  is  not  yet  conscious  of  his 
plight.  Presently,  when  Sugriva  recovers  consciousness,  he 
will  know  how  to  save  himself  and  the  monkeys  in  this  great 
conflict.  That  warrior  will  not  be  pleased  if  I  deliver  him, 
for  his  fair  name  would  be  tarnished  and  irretrievably  lost. 
That  is  why  I  shall  delay  a  while  so  that  he  may  extricate  himself 
from  this  predicament  by  bis  own  prowess  and  I  shall  confine 
myself  to  rallying  the  scattered  forces/ 

Reflecting  thus,  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta,  sought  to  instil 
courage  into  the  simian  army. 

Meanwhile,  bearing  the  great  and  quivering  form  of  the 
monkey  in  his  arms,  Kumbhakarna  returned  to  Lanka,  and  from 
the  temples,  highways,  dwellings  and  city  gates,  the  people 
honoured  him  with  a  rain  of  flowers.  Under  the  shower  of 
roasted  grain  and  the  fragrance  of  the  blossoms  with  which  he 
was  drenched  and  also  on  account  of  the  coolness  of  the  royal 
182 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

highway,  little  by  little  the  valiant  Sugriva  recovered  con- 
sciousness. Borne  in  the  arms  of  his  powerful  rival  and,  beholding 
the  great  highway  of  the  city,  that  warrior  was  assailed  by 
innumerable  thoughts — '  Taken  captive  in  this  way,  what  can 
I  do  now  ?  I  shall  act  in  such  a  way  that  it  is  to  the  advantage 
of  the  monkeys.' 

Then  with  his  sharp  nails,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  instantly 
attacked  the  enemy  of  the  Gods  and  tore  off  his  two  ears  with 
his  teeth,  biting  off  his  nose  and  splitting  his  thighs  with  his  feet. 

With  his  nose  and  ears  torn  off  by  Sugriva's  teeth  and  nails, 
Kumbhakarna,  transported  with  anger,  his  limbs  covered  with 
blood,  threw  the  monkey  down  in  order  to  crush  him.  Flung 
to  the  ground  with  fearful  violence  and  struck  by  the  Enemy 
of  the  Gods,  Sugriva  bounced  into  the  air  like  a  ball  and  with 
all  speed  flew  to  rejoin  Rama. 

Kumbhakarna,  his  ears  and  nose  severed,  drenched  in  gore, 
shone  like  a  mountain  with  its  torrents  and,  covered  with  blood, 
vomiting  blood,  that  gigantic  titan  of  fearful  aspect,  the  younger 
brother  of  Ravana,  blazed  with  anger.  Like  unto  a  mass  of 
dark  collyrium  or  an  evening  cloud,  that  formidable  Ranger  of 
the  Night  resolved  to  enter  into  combat  once  more  and,  Sugriva 
having  escaped,  that  enemy  of  Indra,  furious,  immediately 
threw  himself  into  the  struggle  but  reflecting  '  I  have  no 
weapon  *  that  ferocious  warrior  seized  hold  of  a  huge  hammer. 
Issuing  from  the  city,  the  valiant  titan  began  to  consume  the 
redoubtable  army  of  the  monkeys  with  the  violence  of  Fire  at 
the  destruction  of  the  worlds.  Famished  and  avid  for  flesh, 
Kumbhakarna  entered  the  ranks  of  the  monkeys  and,  in  his 
rage,  like  unto  Mrityu  at  the  end  of  the  world  period,  in- 
discriminately ate  up  titan,  monkey,  Pisacha  and  bear. 
Thereafter  in  his  fury,  he  consumed  the  monkeys,  seizing  one, 
two,  three  or  more  in  one  hand  and  titans  also,  thrusting  them 
greedily  into  his  mouth  so  that  he  streamed  with  flesh  and  blood 
and,  though  struck  by  the  peaks  of  mountains,  continued  to 
feast  on  those  monkeys,  whilst  they,  seeing  their  companions 
being  devoured,  took  refuge  with  Rama,  whereupon 
Kumbhakarna,  in  a  transport  of  rage,  pursued  them  in  order 
to  consume  them.  Seizing  them  in  his  arms,  in  die  chase,  he 
took  hold  of  them  in  groups  of  seven,  eight,  twenty,  thirty  and 
183 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

a  hundred ;  his  limbs  were  covered  with  fat,  flesh  and  blood, 
while  wreaths  of  tangled  entrails  hung  over  his  ears,  and  that 
colossus,  of  sharp  teeth,  began  to  discharge  his  weapons  so  that 
he  appeared  like  Time  at  the  end  of  the  world. 

At  that  instant,  the  son  of  Sumitra,  the  scourge  of  enemy 
hosts  and  the  destroyer  of  hostile  citadels,  enraged,  entered  the 
fight  and  the  courageous  Lakshmana  loosed  seven  darts  into 
Kumbhakama's  body,  aiming  a  hail  of  other  missiles  on  him 
but  Kumbhakarna  shook  off  those  falling  shafts.  Then  the 
valiant  son  of  Sumitra  was  provoked  beyond  measure  and 
covered  the  shining  armour  of  that  titan,  that  was  made  of  gold, 
with  his  shafts,  as  a  mountain  is  overlaid  with  clouds  by  the 
wind  at  evening.  Like  unto  a  mass  of  dark  collyrium,  that  titan, 
riddled  with  golden  darts,  blazed  like  the  sun  shining  amidst 
the  clouds.  And  that  terrible  monster,  whose  voice  equalled 
the  crash  of  countless  thunder-clouds,  spoke  scornfully, 
increasing  Saumitri's  delight,  saying : — 

"  Thou  hast  manifested  thy  courage  by  entering  into  combat, 
fearlessly  with  me,  I  who  have  overcome  Antaka  himself 
without  difficulty  in  the  field  !  He  who  is  able  to  face  the  rival 
of  Mrityu  himself,  armed  for  combat,  is  worthy  of  honour, 
how  much  more  so  if  he  should  enter  into  conflict  with  him ! 
Mounted  on  Airavata  surrounded  by  the  Gods,  Shakra,  their 
king,  has  never  dared  to  challenge  me  to  battle.  This  courage 
from  a  youth  is  gratifying  to  me ;  now  go  hence,  O  Saumitri,  I 
wish  to  meet  Raghava  ! 

M  In  sooth  thy  valour,  energy  and  martial  prowess  are  pleasing 
to  me  but  my  only  desire  is  to  slay  Rama,  when  he  is  slain,  all 
are  slain !  When  Rama  has  fallen  under  my  blows,  I  shall  fight 
with  all  my  might  against  all  those  who  remain  on  the  battlefield ! " 

Thus  boastfully  did  the  titan  speak  and  Saumitri,  with  a 
mocking  smile,  answered  in  dread  accents  saying : — 

**  That  thy  prowess  renders  thee  invincible  to  Shakra  and  the 
other  Gods  is  true,  O  Warrior,  and  to-day  thou  dost  manifest 
the  same  valour  !  Yonder  is  the  son  of  Dasaratha  immoveable 
as  a  rock !  " 

Hearing  these  words,  that  ranger  of  the  night,  the  mighty  and 
powerful  Kumbhakarna,  disregarding  Lakshmana,  passed  him 
by  and,  causing  the  earth  to  tremble,  rushed  on  Rama. 
184 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

The  son  of  Dasaratha,  Rama,  however,  loosed  some  pointed 
arrows  with  Indra's  weapon  on  Kumbhakarna's  breast  and, 
wounded  by  Rama  in  his  furious  course,  flames  mixed  with 
embers  shot  from  his  mouth !  Pierced  by  Rama's  arrow,  that 
lion  among  the  titans,  emitting  a  terrible  cry,  hurled  himself 
full  of  rage  upon  Raghava,  throwing  off  the  monkeys.  With 
bis  breast  pierced  with  darts,  adorned  with  peacock's  plumes, 
his  mace  fell  shattered  from  his  hand  and  all  his  weapons  were 
scattered  on  the  earth.  Finding  himself  disarmed,  that  colossus 
created  a  great  carnage  with  his  fists  and  hands.1  Covered  with 
blood,  that  streamed  from  his  wounds,  like  a  torrent  falling  from 
a  mountain,  his  limbs  riddled  with  arrows,  maddened  by  the 
smell  of  blood,  he  rushed  about  in  bis  violent  rage  devouring 
the  monkeys,  titans  and  bears.  Brandishing  a  huge  crag,  that 
mighty  and  formidable  giant,  the  equal  of  Antaka,  hurled  it  at 
Rama  but  before  it  reached  him,  that  hero  struck  it  in  the  centre 
with  the  aid  of  seven  infallible  darts. 

The  virtuous  Rama,  elder  brother  of  Bharata,  shattered  it  with 
arrows  encrusted  with  gold  and,  like  unto  the  peak  of  Meru, 
that  crag,  shining  with  splendour,  fell,  crushing  two  hundred 
monkeys. 

At  that  instant,  the  virtuous  Lakshmana,  after  reflecting  deeply 
on  the  various  means  of  destroying  Kumbhakama,  said  to  Rama: 

"  O  Prince,  that  monster  is  no  longer  able  to  distinguish 
between  monkeys  and  titans ;  drunk  with  the  smell  of  blood,  he 
devours  friends  and  foes  alike !  Let  the  foremost  of  the 
monkeys  climb  upon  him  courageously  and  let  their  officers 
and  leaders  hang  upon  him  on  every  side ;  under  the  heavy 
load  that  will  crush  him  as  he  is  rushing  over  the  ground, 
that  insensate  one  will  annihilate  the  titans  and  not  the 
monkeys." 

At  these  words  of  that  intelligent  prince,  the  valiant  monkeys 
all  flung  themselves  on  Kumbhakama  with  alacrity  and  he,  full 
of  ire  against  the  monkeys,  who  had  climbed  on  his  back,  shook 
them  violently  as  a  fierce  elephant  his  keepers.  Seeing  the  titan 
shaking  himself  thus,  Rama  said  to  himself :  '  He  is  incensed ' 
and  rushed  upon  him  with  his  excellent  bow.  His  eyes  red  with 
anger,  the  intrepid  Raghava,  consuming  him  with  bis  glance  as 

1  He  having  many  arms. 

185 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIK1 

it  were,  bounded  quickly  forward,  re-tssuring  the  leaders,  who 
were  tormenting  the  mighty  Kumbhakama  and,  in  order  to 
encourage  the  monkeys,  taking  hold  of  his  great  bow  encrusted 
with  gold,  that  with  its  cord  resembled  a  serpent,  Rama  advanced 
with  his  huge  quiver  full  of  arrows. 

Surrounded  by  the  monkey  host,  that  warrior  went  forward 
full  of  valour,  followed  by  Lakshmana  and  he  beheld  the 
illustrious  and  mighty  Kumbhakama,  the  vanquisher  of  his  foes, 
surrounded  by  titans,  his  eyes  inflamed,  adorned  with  golden 
bracelets,  pursuing  all  those  monkeys  with  fury  like  unto  one  of 
the  elephants  of  the  four  quarters;  and  he  resembled  the 
Vindhya  or  Mandara  Mountains  and  was  vomiting  blood  like 
a  great  cloud  pouring  down  rain.  With  his  tongue  he  licked 
the  corners  of  bis  mouth  that  were  wet  with  blood  while  he 
continued  to  destroy  the  simian  army  like  Death  at  the  end  of 
the  world. 

Beholding  that  Prince  of  the  Titans  shining  like  a  glowing 
Yjrnki ,  that  lion  among  men  stretched  his  bow,  and  the  sound  of 
that  weapon  infuriated  that  foremost  of  the  titans,  who,  highly 
provoked,  hurled  himself  on  Raghava. 

Meanwhile  Rama,  whose  arms  were  like  unto  the  great  coils 
of  the  King  of  the  Serpents,  said  ro  Kumbhakama  who,  possessing 
the  splendour  of  a  mountain,  was  rushing  to  attack  him  like  a 
cloud  driven  by  the  tempest : — 

"  Come,  O  Prince  of  the  Titans,  tremble  not,  I  await  thee  bow 
in  hand  and  in  an  instant  will  deprive  thee  of  life  !  " 

'  It  is  Rama  ! '  reflected  Kumbhakama  and,  bursting  forth 
into  hideous  laughter,  rushed  forward  in  fury,  scattering  the 
monkeys  on  the  battlefield.  By  his  monstrous  and  terrible 
laughter,  like  unto  the  muttering  of  a  thundercloud,  he  seemed 
to  cleave  the  hearts  of  the  inhabitants  of  the  woods,  and 
Kumbhakama,  in  his  great  splendour,  said  to  Raghava : — 

"  Take  me  not  for  Viradha,  Kabanda  or  Khara,  Bali  or 
Maricha ;  it  is  1,  Kumbhakama,  who  stand  here  !  Behold  my 
dreadful  and  mighty  mace  wrought  of  iron ;  with  this,  Devas 
and  Danavas  were  formerly  struck  down  by  me  !  Do  not  hold 
me  in  contempt  in  that  I  possess  neither  nose  nor  ears,  1  do  not 
feel  the  least  discomfort  or  pain  on  account  of  their  loss !

arrows  at  Kumbhakarna  that  struck  him  with  the  force  of 
lightning  but  that  enemy  of  the  Gods  was  neither  shaken  nor 
moved  and  those  shafts,  which  had  pierced  seven  Sala  Trees 
and  slain  that  bull  among  the  monkeys,  Bali,  cut  into  the  body 
of  the  titan  that  was  as  hard  as  a  diamond. 

Then,  as  though  they  were  drops  of  water,  that  enemy  of  the 
mighty  Indra,  drank  up  those  arrows  through  his  body,  thus 
quenching  their  fury,  whilst  he  whirled  his  mace  in  a  fine  frenzy. 
And  that  weapon  covered  with  blood,  the  terror  of  the  celestial 
hosts,  brandished  by  that  titan  with  formidable  energy,  created 
panic  in  the  simian  ranks. 

Then  Rama,  taking  up  another  arrow  named  the  Vayavya,1 
loosed  it  against  that  ranger  of  the  night  and  cut  off  the  arm  with 
which  he  held  the  mace.  With  his  arm  severed,  he  let  out  a 
terrible  cry  and  his  arm,  cut  off  by  Raghava's  shaft,  fell  with  its 
mace,  like  unto  the  peak  of  a  mountain  on  the  army  of  the  King 
of  the  Monkeys,  crushing  it.  Thereafter,  beside  themselves, 
the  monkeys  who  had  escaped  the  massacre  caused  by  that  fall, 
their  limbs  lacerated,  took  refuge  in  the  vicinity  and  became  the 
witnesses  of  the  terrific  struggle  between  that  Indra  among  men 
and  the  Prince  of  the  Titans. 

His  arm  severed  by  that  arrow,  Kumbhakarna  resembling 
the  King  of  the  Mountains  its  peak  cloven  by  a  great  sword, 
struck  down  a  tree  with  his  remaining  hand  and  rushed  upon 
that  lord  of  men,  but  Rama,  with  a  shaft  decorated  with  gold 
joined  to  Indra's  weapon,  cut  off  his  upraised  arm  like  the 
coiled  body  of  a  snake  and  the  Tala  Tree  also. 

Beholding  the  titan  with  two  arms  severed  who,  roaring,  was 
rushing  upon  him,  Rama  took  out  two  whetted  and  crescent- 
shaped  arrows  and  severed  his  two  feet,  whereupon  the  interme- 
diary regions,  the  four  quarters,  the  caves  of  the  mountain, 
the  vast  ocean,  the  City  of  Lanka  and  the  ranks  of  the  monkeys 
resounded  with  the  thunder  of  bis  fall. 

His  arms  and  legs  severed,  that  titan  opened  his  mouth  like 
Vadavamukha  and  suddenly  rushed  howling  on  Rama  like 

1  Vayu's  weapon.     See  glossary  of  weapons.

Rahu  on  the  moon  in  the  sky.  Thereupon  Rama  filled  his 
mouth  with  steel-pointed  and  plumed  shafts  decorated  with 
gold  and,  with  his  mouth  thus  filled,  he  was  unable  to  speak  and, 
emitting  inarticulated  sounds  with  extreme  difficulty,  fell 
senseless. 

Thereupon  Rama  selected  an  arrow  bright  as  the  rays  of  the 
sun,  which  resembled  the  Rod  of  Brahma  at  the  time  of  the 
final  dissolution  and  was  fatal  to  his  foes,  the  weapon  of  Indra, 
well-plumed  and  sharpened,  the  rival  of  Maruta  in  speed,  and 
Rama  discharged  that  arrow,  the  shaft  of  which  was  admirably 
inlaid  with  diamonds  and  gold,  brilliant  as  the  flames  of  a  blazing 
sun,  swift  as  Mahendra's  thunderbolt,  against  that  ranger  of  the 
night. 

Loosed  from  Raghava's  arm,  that  missile,  which  lit  up  the 
ten  regions  with  its  brilliance  and  which,  in  its  formidable 
aspect,  resembled  a  smokeless  flame,  struck  that  Prince  of  the 
Titans,  the  equal  of  Shakra  and  severed  his  head  with  its 
prominent  teeth  and  swinging  earrings,  like  unto  the  peak  of  a 
high  mountain,  as  formerly  Purandara  severed  the  head  of 
Vritra.  The  enormous  head  of  Kumbhakarna  with  the  curls 
that  adorned  it,  looked  like  the  moon  floating  in  the  sky  at  the 
time  of  the  sun's  rising,  when  the  night  has  passed.  Severed 
by  Rama's  shafts,  the  head  of  the  titan  resembling  a  mountain, 
fell  on  the  earth  crushing  the  highways,  residences,  gates  and 
edifices  of  the  city,  bearing  down  the  high  walls  also ;  and  that 
gigantic  body  of  great  resplendence  belonging  to  the  titan,  fell 
into  the  sea  where  it  crushed  the  great  sharks,  huge  fishes  and 
serpents,  and  plunged  into  the  depths  below. 

When  Kumbhakarna,  that  great  enemy  of  the  brahmins  and 
the  Gods,  was  slain  in  combat,  the  earth  shook  as  all  the 
mountains  also  and  the  Celestials  shouted  for  joy.  Thereafter 
Gods,  Rishis,  Maharishis,  Pannagas,  Suras,  Bhutas,  Suparnas, 
Guhyakas  and  the  hosts  of  Yakshas  and  Gandharvas,  who 
ranged  the  skies,  loudly  extolled  Rama's  exploit. 

But  on  beholding  that  valiant  Prince  of  the  House  of  Raghu, 
the  adherents  and  kinsfolk  of  the  Lord  of  the  Nairritas  emitted 
loud  cries  at  Kumbhakarna's  fall,  as  do  elephants  in  the  presence 
of  a  lion.  Having  overcome  Kumbhakarna  in  the  field,  Rama, 
amidst  the  simian  host,  resembled  the  sun  emerging  from  the 
x88 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

jaws  of  Rahu  when  it  drives  away  the  darkness  from  the 
celestial  region. 

In  their  delight,  the  countless  monkeys,  whose  faces  resembled 
opening  lotuses,  lauded  Prince  Raghava,  who  saw  the  fulfilment 
of  his  desires  in  the  death  of  his  formidable  adversary,  and  the 
elder  brother  of  Bharata  rejoiced  that  he  had  slain  Kumbhakarna, 
the  Scourge  of  the  Gods,  who  had  never  been  overcome  in  any 
great  encounter,  as  the  King  of  the  Celestials  rejoiced  at  the 
death  of  the  great  Asura,  Vritra. 


chapter   68 

Havana  weeps  for  Kumbhakarna 

Seeing  Kumbhakarna  fall  under  the  blows  of  the  exceedingly 
courageous  Raghava,  the  titans  brought  the  tidings  to  their 
King,  Ravana,  and  said  : — 

"  O  King,  the  rival  of  Kala  is  dead !  Having  overthrown 
the  monkey  ranks  and  devoured  the  Plavagas,  he,  for  a  space, 
displayed  his  prowess  which  has  now  been  extinguished  by 
Rama's  unconquerable  strength  and  half  his  body  lies  submerged 
in  the  vast  ocean.  Streaming  with  blood,  bis  nose  and  ears 
severed,  his  head  obstructing  Lanka's  gateway,  he  who  resembled 
a  mountain,  Kumbhakarna,  thy  brother,  struck  down  by 
Kakutstha's  arrow,  is  now  but  a  naked  and  mutilated  corpse, 
like  unto  a  tree  consumed  by  fire  !  " 

Hearing  this  report  of  the  mighty  Kumbhakarna's  death  on 
the  battlefield,  Ravana,  overwhelmed  with  distress,  swooned  away. 

Learning  that  their  paternal  uncle  had  been  slain,  Devantaka, 
Karantaka,  Trishiras  and  Atikaya,  a  prey  to  grief,  groaned  aloud, 
and  Mahodara  and  Mahaparshwa,  on  hearing  that  their  brother 
had  perished  under  the  blows  of  Rama  of  imperishable  exploits, 
were  seized  with  anguish. 

Thereafter,  regaining  his  senses  with  extreme  difficulty,  that 
lion  among  the  titans,  tormented  by  the  death  of  Kumbhakarna, 
his  senses  troubled,  began  to  lament,  saying : — 

"  O  Hero,  O  Humbler  of  the  pride  of  thy  foes,  O  Mighty 
Kumbhakarna,  urged  on  by  destiny,  thou  hast  left  me  for  the 
189 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

abode  of  death  !  To  go  whither  hast  thou  deserted  me  without 
having  extracted  that  thorn  from  my  side  or  from  the  side  of  my 
kinsfolk  ?  O  Thou  powerful  warrior,  destroyer  of  hostile 
ranks,  from  henceforth  I  no  longer  exist  since  I  have  lost  my 
right  arm,  the  support  that  delivered  me  from  the  fear  of  the  Gods 
and  Asuras.  How  has  such  a  warrior,  who  quelled  the  pride 
of  the  Gods  and  Danavas,  who  resembled  the  Fire  of  Time, 
fallen  to-day  in  the  fight  with  Raghava?  How  has  Rama 
been  able,  with  a  single  arrow,  to  stretch  thee  on  the  ground, 
thou,  whom  the  descent  of  the  thunderbolt  could  not  overwhelm? 
Seeing  thee  succumb  in  combat,  the  Hosts  of  the  Gods,  standing 
in  the  heavens  with  the  Rishis,  emit  shouts  of  joy.  Assuredly 
this  very  day  the  Plavamgamas,  making  use  of  a  favourable 
occasion,  will  scale  the  gates  and  fortifications  of  Lanka  on  every 
side,  which  heretofore  were  impregnable !  I  have  no  further 
need  for  a  kingdom  and  what  shall  I  do  with  Sita  ?  Bereft  of 
Kumbhakarna,  I  no  longer  wish  to  live.  Since  I  am  unable  to 
kill  Raghava,  the  slayer  of  my  brother  in  combat,  would  it  not 
be  better  to  die,  for  life  is  empty  to  me  ?  To-day  I  shall  go 
where  my  brother  has  gone,  nay,  far  from  my  brother  I  cannot 
live  for  an  instant !  Witnessing  my  plight,  the  Gods,  who  were 
formerly  wronged  by  me,  will  certainly  mock  me !  O 
Kumbhakarna,  now  that  thou  art  dead,  how  shall  I  vanquish 
Indra  ?  Bibishana's  prudent  speech,  that  great  soul  whom  I 
disregarded  in  my  blindness,  has  proved  true;  the  cruel  end 
of  Kumbhakarna  and  Frahasta  has  justified  his  words !  This 
is  the  disastrous  consequence  of  that  deed  of  mine,  the  banish- 
ment of  the  virtuous  and  fortunate  Bibishana." 

Such  were  the  many  burning  lamentations  to  which  the 
Ten-necked  Ravana  gave  voice  in  the  anguish  of  his  soul  on 
account  of  Kumbhakarna,  his  younger  brother,  the  enemy  of 
Indra,  and,  knowing  him  to  have  perished  in  combat,  he  swooned 
away.

CHAPTER    69 

Narantaka  is  slain  by  Angada 

Hearing  the  lamentation  of  the  wicked  Ravana  who  was 
overcome  with  grief,  Trishiras  addressed  him  thus  :— 

"  O  King,  brave  men  do  not  give  way  to  sorrow  even  at  the 
death  of  so  valiant  a  warrior  as  thy  younger  brother,  our  uncle. 
Since  thou  art  able  to  conquer  the  Three  Worlds,  O  Lord, 
why,  like  a  common  man,  dost  thou  suffer  thy  courage  to  falter? 
Brahma  bestowed  on  thee  a  spear,  mail,  a  dart,  a  bow  and  a 
chariot  harnessed  to  a  thousand  mules,  sending  forth  a  rumble 
like  unto  a  thundercloud ;  furnished  with  all  these  weapons, 
thou  wilt  vanquish  Raghava  !  Yet  if  it  please  thee,  O  Great 
Ring,  I  myself  will  descend  into  the  arena  and  bear  away  thy 
foes,  as  Garuda  the  serpents.  As  Shambara  fell  under  the  blows 
of  the  King  of  the  Gods  and  Naraka  under  those  of  Vishnu,  so 
shall  Rama  fall  this  day,  struck  down  by  me  on  the  battlefield." 

At  these  words  of  Trishiras,  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans, 
under  the  sway  of  destiny,  felt  himself  to  be  born  anew  and, 
hearing  Trishiras  speak  thus,  Devantaka,  Narantaka  and  Atikaya, 
burning  with  martial  ardour,  desired  nothing  more  than  to  enter 
into  combat.  "Away!  Away!"  roared  those  valiant  sons  of 
Ravana,  the  foremost  of  the  Nairritas,  the  equals  of  Shakra  in 
prowess. 

All  were  able  to  fly  in  the  air,  all  were  skilled  in  magic,  all  had 
humbled  the  pride  of  the  Gods,  all  were  invincible  warriors, 
all  were  endowed  with  great  strength,  all  enjoyed  great  renown, 
of  none  was  it  recounted  that  they  had  been  defeated  in  battle 
even  by  the  Gods,  Gandharvas,  Kinneras  or  great  Serpents. 
All  were  expert  in  the  use  of  weapons,  all  were  courageous  and 
able  fighters,  all  were  highly  learned  and  all  had  been  the 
recipients  of  great  boons. 

Surrounded  by  his  sons,  the  king,  radiant  as  the  solar  orb, 
the  destroyer  of  the  power  and  glory  of  his  foes,  shone  like 
Maghavat  amidst  the  Gods,  the  humbler  of  the  pride  of  the 
great  Danavas. 

191 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Embracing  bis  sons,  he  covered  them  with  ornaments  and  sent 
them  out  to  fight,  heaping  blessings  upon  them.  Nevertheless 
Ravana  sent  his  brothers  Yuddhonmatta  and  Matta  to  accompany 
those  youthful  warriors  and  watch  over  them  in  the  struggle. 
Then  those  heroes  of  immense  stature  paid  obeisance  to  the 
mighty  Ravana,  the  destroyer  of  creatures,  and,  circumambula- 
ting him,  departed.  Thereafter  the  foremost  of  the  Nairritas, 
furnished  with  every  kind  of  medicinal  herb  and  perfume,  went 
away,  eager  to  fight,  and  Trishiras,  Atikaya,  Devantaka, 
Narantaka,  Mahodara  and  Mahaparshwa,  under  the  sway  of 
destiny,  set  out. 

A  magnificent  elephant,  like  unto  a  dark  cloud,  offspring  of 
Airavata's  race,  named  Sudarshana,  served  as  Mahodara's 
mount  and  that  hero,  furnished  with  every  weapon,  armed  with 
a  quiver,  seated  on  his  elephant,  shone  like  the  sun  on  the  peak 
of  the  Astachala  Mountain. 

Trishiras,  born  of  Ravana,  was  seated  in  an  excellent  car 
drawn  by  the  foremost  of  steeds  and  it  was  filled  with  weapons 
of  every  kind.  Standing  in  his  chariot,  armed  with  his  bow,  he 
looked  as  resplendent  as  a  storm  cloud  on  the  peak  of  a  mountain, 
attended  by  lightning,  thunder,  meteors  and  Indra's  bow.1 
With  his  iriple  crown,  Trishiras  shone  in  his  chariot  like  Himavat, 
the  Lord  of  Mountains  with  its  golden  crests. 

Then  the  exceedingly  war-like  Atikaya,  son  unto  that  Lord 
of  the  Titans,  most  skilful  of  archers,  ascended  a  superb  chariot 
with  excellent  wheels,  stout  axles,  magnificent  steeds,  carriage 
and  yoke,  rich  in  quivers  and  bows,  filled  with  missiles,  swords 
and  maces,  and  that  warrior  wore  a  diadem  encrusted  with  gold 
and  covered  with  gems  so  that  he  looked  like  Mem  shining  in 
its  own  splendour.  That  mighty  Prince  of  the  Titans,  surrounded 
by  the  foremost  of  the  Nairritas,  glowed  in  bis  chariot  like  the 
God  who  bears  the  thunderbolt  amidst  the  Immortals. 

And  Narantaka,  mounted  on  a  white  steed,  as  swift  as  thought, 
harnessed  with  gold,  resembling  Ucchairavas,  was  armed  with  a 
javelin  like  unto  a  thunderbolt  and  appeared  exceedingly 
resplendent,  resembling  the  illustrious  Guha,  the  offspring  of 
Shikhin  riding  on  his  peacock. 
Devantaka,  bearing  a  gilded  iron  bar,  looked  like  an  incarnation 

1  Indra's  bow — The  Rainbow.

YUDDHA    KANDA 

of  Vishnu  holding  the  Mandara  Mountain  in  his  arms  and 
Mahaparshwa,  full  of  strength  and  energy,  brandished  a  mace 
like  unto  Kuvera  armed  for  combat. 

Thereafter  those  intrepid  warriors  set  out  from  Lanka  like 
the  Gods  leaving  Amaravati  and  powerful  titans  on  elephants, 
horses  and  in  chariots  thundering  like  clouds,  followed,  armed 
with  excellent  weapons ;  and  those  youthful  beings  shone  like 
the  blazing  sun  with  their  brows  encircled  with  diadems, 
sparkling  in  splendour  like  planets  flaming  in  the  heavens  and, 
in  the  brightness  of  the  raiment  in  which  they  were  attired,  that 
brilliant  cavalcade  resembled  an  autumn  cloud  or  a  flock  of 
cranes  in  the  sky. 

Determined  to  die  or  vanquish  their  foe,  they  went  forward 
in  this  courageous  resolve,  eager  to  fight,  boasting,  shouting 
and  uttering  threats,  and  those  invincible  heroes  set  out  furnished 
with  arrows  amidst  the  clamour  and  clapping  of  hands,  causing 
the  earth  to  tremble  as  it  were. 

As  the  roars  of  their  troops  seemed  to  rend  the  heavens,  those 
mighty  titan  princes,  full  of  joy,  increased  their  pace  and  beheld 
the  simian  host  brandishing  rocks  and  trees,  whilst  from  their 
side,  the  courageous  leaders  of  the  monkeys  observed  the  titan 
army  with  its  mass  of  elephants,  horses  and  chariots  advancing 
like  unto  a  thunder  cloud  to  the  sound  of  hundreds  of  gongs 
and,  furnished  with  huge  weapons,  encompassed  on  all  sides 
by  the  resplendent  Nairritas,  resembling  blazing  torches  or 
suns. 

Beholding  that  company  approaching,  the  desire  of  the 
Plavamgamas  was  realised  and,  armed  with  huge  rocks,  they 
redoubled  their  cries  in  their  eagerness  to  fight  the  titans,  who 
responded  with  their  shouts.  Hearing  the  roars  that  the  mon- 
keys and  their  leaders  let  forth,  the  titan  ranks,  provoked  by  the 
joyous  cheering  of  the  enemy,  roared  with  an  even  greater  fury 
in  their  extreme  valour. 

Thereafter,  as  they  joined  issue  with  that  formidable  host  of 
titans,  the  monkeys  with  their  leaders  hurled  themselves  upon 
them,  brandishing  sharp  rocks  like  unto  mountains  and  those 
Plavamgamas,  armed  with  crags  and  trees,  threw  themselves 
upon  the  titan  forces,  some  fighting  in  the  air  and  some  on  the 
ground.  Some  amongst  those  foremost  of  monkeys  fought 
193 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

with  heavily-branched  trees  and  the  struggle  between  the  titans 
and  the  monkeys  became  desperate. 

Those  monkeys  of  redoubtable  courage  let  an  unequalled 
shower  of  trees,  stones  and  rocks  fall  on  the  enemy  who  over- 
whelmed them  with  a  hail  of  missiles.  Titans  and  monkeys 
roared  like  lions  on  the  battlefield ;  the  Plavamgamas  crushed 
the  Yatudhanas  with  blows  from  stones  and,  in  fury  struck  those 
warriors  covered  in  mail  and  jewels,  mounted  in  chariots,  and 
on  elephants  and  horses  in  the  fray.  Then  the  Plavamgamas 
redoubled  their  attacks  against  the  Yatudhanas  with  crags  that 
they  tore  up  with  their  hands.  Their  bodies  tense,  their  eyes 
starting  from  their  heads,  shouting,  they  stumbled  and  fell, 
whilst  those  lions  among  the  titans,  on  their  side,  pierced  those 
elephants  among  the  monkeys  with  sharp  arrows,  striking  them 
with  spears,  mallets,  swords,  javelins  and  lances  and  they  mowed 
each  other  down  in  their  desire  to  triumph.  The  limbs  of 
monkeys  and  titans  were  streaming  with  the  blood  of  their 
enemies,  and  rocks  and  swords,  thrown  by  the  monkeys  and 
titans,  covered  the  blood-stained  earth  in  an  instant,  so  that  the 
ground  was  smothered  with  titans  like  unto  mountains,  who,  mad 
with  martial  ardour,  had  been  crushed  and  mangled  by  their  foes. 

Thereafter  the  monkeys,  giving  and  receiving  blows,  their 
rocks  shattered,  engaged  in  a  fresh  and  dreadful  fight,  using  the 
severed  limbs  as  weapons.  And  the  Nairritas  struck  the  monkeys 
with  their  own  corpses  and  the  apes  struck  the  titans  with  the 
titan  dead.  Tearing  the  rocks  from  the  hands  of  their  foes,  the 
titans  broke  them  on  the  heads  of  the  monkeys  who  shattered 
the  arrows  of  the  titans,  using  the  pieces  to  destroy  them.  And 
they  overwhelmed  each  other  with  crags  in  the  battle  and 
monkeys  and  titans  set  up  a  roaring  like  unto  lions. 

Then,  their  armour  and  shields  pierced,  those  titans,  attacked 
by  the  monkeys,  dripped  blood  as  trees  their  sap,  and  some 
monkeys  in  the  conflict,  destroyed  chariots  with  chariots, 
elephants  with  elephants,  horses  with  horses,  whilst  the  titans 
employed  weapons  like  razors  or  half  moons  and  Bhallas  and 
pointed  shafts  in  order  to  shatter  the  rocks  and  trees  of  those 
intrepid  monkeys.  In  that  encounter,  the  earth  became  im- 
passable, covered  as  it  was  with  monkeys  and  titans  mangled  and 
crushed  under  the  rocks  and  trees  in  the  fight. 
194 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Full  of  audacity  and  ardour,  the  monkeys,  engaged  in  the 
struggle,  casting  aside  all  fear,  fought  the  titans  with  a  light 
heart  and  various  kinds  of  weapons. 

Witnessing  that  appalling  mfclee,  the  joy  of  the  monkeys  and 
the  massacre  of  the  titans,  the  great  Rishis  and  hosts  of  Celestial 
Beings  emitted  shouts  of  triumph. 

Narantaka  however,  mounted  on  his  steed,  that  was  as  swift 
as  the  wind,  with  a  pointed  lance  plunged  into  the  thick  of  the 
simian  ranks  like  a  fish  into  the  sea  and  that  warrior  pierced 
seven  hundred  monkeys  with  his  effulgent  spear  and  that  enemy 
of  Indra,  of  exceeding  courage,  in  an  instant,  single-handed, 
overthrew  the  army  of  the  foremost  of  monkeys  under  the  eyes 
of  the  Vidhyadharas  and  Maharishis,  hacking  a  pathway  for 
himself  through  the  simian  ranks,  the  bleeding  flesh  its  mire, 
and  which  was  covered  with  heaps  of  monkey  corpses  as  high  as 
hills. 

Whenever  those  lions  among  the  monkeys  sought  to  bar  his 
way,  so  often  did  Narantaka  cleave  their  ranks  by  mowing  them 
down.  As  a  fire  burns  up  a  forest,  so  did  he  consume  those 
simian  battalions  and  each  time  those  inhabitants  of  the  woods 
tore  up  the  trees  and  rocks,  they  fell  under  his  lance  like  moun- 
tains riven  by  lightning. 

Brandishing  his  glittering  spear  in  the  forefront  of  battle,  the 
valiant  Narantaka  ranged  the  entire  welkin,  overthrowing 
everything  in  his  course  as  the  wind  in  the  rainy  season  and, 
whether  they  stayed  at  their  post  or  went  out  to  meet  him,  those 
courageous  monkeys  could  neither  stand  against  him  nor  escape 
from  him  so  that  all  fell,  pierced  by  that  warrior. 

That  unique  javelin  resembling  Death  itself,1  bright  as  the 
sun,  was  able,  by  itself,  to  destroy  the  ranks  of  the  monkeys 
and  leave  them  stretched  on  the  earth,  and  the  impact  of  that 
pike  resembled  the  stroke  of  lightning  so  that  the  monkeys 
were  unable  to  endure  it  and  emitted  loud  cries.  Those 
high-souled  and  intrepid  monkeys,  falling,  resembled  the 
peaks  of  mountains  crumbling  away,  struck  by  lightning. 

Meanwhile  the  powerful  leaders  of  the  monkeys,  who  had 
previously  been  put  to  flight  by  Kumbhakarna,  having  regained 
their  vigour,  were  ranged  round  Sugriva  and  he,  looking  about 

1  The  Reaper  Death. 

195 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

him,  observed  the  army  of  the  monkeys  fleeing  before  Narantaka, 
terror-stricken  and  scattering  in  all  directions. 

Witnessing  this  stampede,  he  beheld  Narantaka,  spear  in 
hand,  who  was  advancing,  mounted  on  his  steed.  At  this,  the 
illustrious  Sugriva,  King  of  the  Monkeys,  addressed  the  youthful 
Prince  Angada,  a  warrior  whose  valour  equalled  Shakra's,  and 
said: — 

"  Go  out  against  that  bold  titan,  who,  riding  on  a  horse,  is 
consuming  the  army  I  have  sent  against  him  and  speedily 
deprive  him  of  his  life's  breaths." 

At  this  command  from  his  sovereign,  the  intrepid  Angada, 
the  foremost  of  monkeys  resembling  a  rocky  mass,  broke  away 
from  that  company  like  the  sun  emerging  from  a  cloud  and,  with 
the  bracelets  he  wore,  he  glittered  like  a  mountain  with  its 
metallic  veins.  Without  any  weapons  save  his  nails  and  teeth, 
that  son  of  Bali,  in  his  great  strength,  rushed  out  to  meet 
Narantaka  and  said  to  him : — 

"  Why  dost  thou  strive  with  common  monkeys  ?  Do  thou 
with  thy  spear,  the  impact  of  which  is  equal  to  lightning,  strike 
my  breast  which  I  now  present  to  thee !  " 

The  words  of  Angada,  son  of  Bali,  angered  Narantaka,  who 
bit  his  lip  with  his  teeth  hissing  like  a  serpent,  and  hurled 
himself  upon  him  in  fury.  Brandishing  his  spear,  which 
glittered  like  fire,  he  struck  at  Angada  but  the  weapon  broke 
against  the  breast  of  that  son  of  Bali,  that  was  as  hard  as  diamond, 
and  fell  to  the  earth. 

Seeing  his  lance  shattered,  like  a  snake  whose  powerful  coils 
are  sundered  by  Suparna,  the  son  of  Bali  raised  his  hand  and 
struck  the  head  of  the  steed  of  his  adversary.  Sinking  to  its 
knees,  its  eyeballs  starting  from  their  sockets,  its  tongue  hanging 
out,  that  horse,  as  high  as  a  hill,  fell  to  the  earth,  its  head  crushed 
by  the  blow  from  the  palm  of  his  hand. 

Then  Narantaka,  beholding  his  steed  lying  dead,  grew  enraged 
and,  clenching  his  fist,  struck  the  son  of  Bali  on  the  forehead 
with  energy  so  that  the  hot  blood  gushed  forth  from -his  injured 
brow.  Now  he  flared  up  with  wrath  and  then  swooned  away 
and,  having  lost  consciousness  awhile,  on  coming  to  himself 
was  confused. 

Thereafter  Angada,  Bali's  mighty  son,  clenching  his  fist, 
196 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

which  equalled  Mrityu's  in  strength  and  resembled  a  great  rock, 
brought  it  down  on  Narantaka's  breast. 

His  chest  crushed,  broken  by  the  shock,  vomiting  flames,  his 
limbs  streaming  with  blood,  Narantaka  fell  on  the  earth  like  a 
mountain  struck  by  lightning :  and  when  the  mighty  Narantaka 
fell  in  the  struggle  with  Bali's  son,  from  the  sky,  the  foremost 
of  the  Celestials  and  the  monkeys  emitted  a  great  shout  of 
triumph  !  And  Angada  filled  Rama's  heart  with  joy  and  he  was 
astonished  at  his  exceedingly  difficult  achievement.  Thereafter 
that  warrior  of  illustrious  exploits  eagerly  prepared  for  fresh 
encounters.

The  Death  of  Devantaka,  Trishiras,  Mahodara  and  Mahaparshwa 

Seeing  that  Narantaka  was  slain,  those  lions  among  the 
Nairritas,  Devantaka,  Trishiras  and  Mahodara,  the  son  of 
Poulastya,  wept  bitterly. 

Thereafter  Mahodara,  mounted  on  that  Indra  of  elephants 
like  unto  a  cloud,  rushed  impetuously  on  the  exceedingly 
energetic  son  of  Bali 

Then  the  valiant  Devantaka,  distressed  on  account  of  the 
calamity  that  had  visited  his  brother,  arming  himself  with  a 
formidable  mace,  also  ran  on  Angada  and,  in  his  turn,  the 
energetic  Trishiras,  standing  in  his  chariot,  that  was  as  bright  as 
the  sun  and  harnessed  to  excellent  steeds,  advanced  on  the  son 
of  Bali. 

Attacked  by  three  of  the  foremost  of  titans,  who  had  humbled 
the  pride  of  the  Gods,  Angada  tore  up  a  many-branched  tree, 
and  as  Shakra  his  flaming  thunderbolt,  hurled  that  huge  trunk 
with  its  immense  branches  at  Devantaka.  Thereupon  Trishiras 
severed  it  with  his  arrows  which  resembled  venomous  snakes 
and  Angada,  beholding  the  tree  shattered,  darted  forward  and 
that  elephant  among  monkeys  caused  a  shower  of  trees  and  rocks 
to  fall  upon  the  titans. 

Enraged,  Trishiras  broke  them  with  his  whetted  shafts  and, 
with  the  head  of  his  mace,  Mahodara  crushed  them,  while 

o  197 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Trishiras  pursued  the  valiant  Angada  with  his  darts.  Thereafter 
Mahodara  urged  his  elephant  to  advance  on  the  son  of  Bali 
and,  in  his  anger,  pierced  his  breast  with  Tomaras  that  were 
equal  to  lightning}  and  Devantaka,  provoked,  approaching 
Angada,  struck  him  with  his  mace  and  swiftly  turned  away.  The 
combined  assault  of  those  three  Nairritas  left  that  illustrious 
warrior  unmoved;  that  agile  and  invincible  hero  however  hurled 
himself  in  great  fury  on  the  colossal  elephant  belonging  to 
Mahodara  and,  with  the  palm  of  his  hand,  struck  it  down. 

Its  eyes  starting  from  their  sockets,  the  elephant  fell  dead  and 
that  powerful  son  of  Bali  tore  out  one  of  its  tusks,  thereafter, 
rushing  on  Devantaka,  he  dealt  him  a  blow  in  that  struggle 
which  caused  him  to  stumble  like  a  tree  buffeted  by  the  wind, 
and  he  vomited  blood  profusely  which  was  the  colour  of  lac. 
Breathing  with  difficulty,  the  energetic  and  mighty  Devantaka, 
brandishing  his  mace,  struck  Angada  a  violent  blow.  At 
the  impact,  the  son  of  that  Indra  among  Monkeys  fell  to  his 
knees  but  soon  rose  up  again  and,  as  he  did  so,  Trishiras,  with 
three  infallible  and  formidable  darts,  pierced  that  son  of  the 
simian  king. 

Meanwhile  Hanuman  and  Nila,  beholding  Angada  assaulted 
by  three  of  the  foremost  of  the  titans,  came  to  his  aid,  and  Nila 
struck  Trishiras  with  a  rock  which  the  skilful  son  of  Ravana 
broke  with  his  sharp  darts.  Shattered  by  a  hundred  arrows, 
its  surface  broken  to  pieces,  that  rocky  peak,  from  which  sparks 
and  flames  spurted,  fell. 

Witnessing  their  astonishment,  the  courageous  Devantaka, 
full  of  joy,  in  the  fight  flung  himself  with  his  mace  on  the  son  of 
Maruta  and,  as  he  rushed  upon  him,  that  lion  among  the  monkeys 
leapt  to  meet  him  and  with  his  fist  struck  hir"  a  thunderous  blow 
on  the  head.  Thereafter  the  heroic  son  of  Vayu,  that  great 
and  powerful  monkey,  battered  in  his  skull  and  his  roaring 
caused  the  titans  to  tremble.  Devantaka,  the  son  of  the  King  of 
the  Titans,  gasping  from  the  blow,  his  skull  shattered,  his  teeth 
protruding,  his  eyes  starting  from  their  sockets,  his  tongue 
hanging  out,  fell  to  the  earth  instantly  bereft  of  life. 

Enraged  by  the  death  of  the  foremost  of  the  titan  warriors,  that 
mighty  enemy  of  the  Gods,  Trishiras,  let  fall  a  fearful  shower  of 
whetted  shafts  on  Nila's  breast  and  Mahodara,  in  fury,  quickly 
198 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

mounted  a  second  elephant  as  high  as  a  bill.  As  the  sun  scales 
the  Mandara  Mountain,  so  did  he  let  fall  a  rain  of  arrows  on 
Nila  as,  under  a  rainbow,  a  cloud  lets  loose  a  shower  on  a  moun- 
tain amidst  the  muttering  of  thunder.  Covered  with  those  darts, 
with  which  the  valiant  titan  overwhelmed  him,  the  leader  of  the 
monkey  army,  his  limbs  pierced,  faltering,  swooned  away;  then 
coming  to  himself,  Nila  tore  up  a  rock  covered  with  many- 
branched  trees  and,  with  a  terrific  bound  leapt  on  Mahodaia  and 
struck  him  on  the  head.  Crushed  by  the  impact  with  which  that 
elephant  among  monkeys  had  just  overwhelmed  him,  Mahodara 
fell  to  earth  deprived  of  life,  like  a  rock  riven  by  lightning. 

Beholding  his  uncle  shun,  Trishiras  seized  hold  of  his  bow  and, 
full  of  ire,  pierced  Hanuman  with  his  sharp  arrows.  Thereupon 
the  son  of  the  Wind,  provoked,  flung  a  crag  at  the  valiant 
Trishiras  who  broke  it  to  pieces  with  his  whetted  shafts.  Seeing 
that  his  missile  was  useless,  the  monkey  let  fall  a  rain  of  trees 
on  the  son  of  Ravana  in  the  snuggle  and  he,  observing  that 
shower  of  trees  falling  through  the  air  upon  him,  severed  them 
in  fury  with  his  sharp  arrows,  emitting  shouts  of  triumph.  Then 
Hanuman,  leaping  upon  his  steed,  tore  at  it  violently  with  his 
nails,  as  the  King  of  the  Beasts  claws  a  great  elephant. 

Thereafter,  from  his  side,  the  son  of  Ravana,  as  Death  with 
his  noose,  arming  himself  with  a  spear  hurled  himself  on  the 
son  of  Anila.  As  a  meteor  falls  from  the  skies,  so  did  that  lance 
descend  unobstructed  and  that  lion  among  the  monkeys  caught 
it  and  snapped  it,  emitting  a  great  shout. 

Beholding  that  weapon  of  formidable  aspect  destroyed  by 
Hanuman,  the  monkey  forces  raised  joyful  roars  like  unto  the 
rumble  of  thunder,  and  Trishiras,  the  foremost  of  the  titans, 
drawing  his  sword,  pierced  the  breast  of  that  Indra  of  the 
Monkeys. 

Wounded  by  the  thrust  of  his  sword,  the  mighty  Hanuman, 
born  of  Maruta,  struck  that  Three-headed  One  on  the  breast 
with  the  palm  of  his  hand.  Smitten  by  the  blow  from 
Hanuman 's  palm,  the  illustrious  Trishiras  let  his  gauntlet  fall 
and  dropped  swooning  to  the  ground,  and  as  he  fell,  the  great 
monkey,  who  resembled  a  mountain,  broke  bis  sword  letting 
out  a  roar  which  struck  terror  in  all  the  titans.  Unable  to  endure 
the  terrible  cry  of  triumph,  that  ranger  of  the  night  rose  up 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  struck  Hanuman  with  his  fist.  The  blow  infuriated  the 
great  monkey  who,  in  anger,  seized  hold  of  the  titan  by  his 
crown  and,  as  formerly  Shakra  severed  the  head  of  Tashtri's 
son,1  so  Hanuman,  with  a  terrific  stroke  of  his  sharp  sword,  cut 
off  his  three  heads  each  encircled  with  a  diadem  and  decorated 
with  earrings.  The  heads  of  that  enemy  of  Indra  with  their 
large  eyes  resembling  stones,  their  glances  like  unto  a  glowing 
brazier,  fell  to  the  earth  like  stars  falling  from  the  sky.  When 
the  enemy  of  the  Gods,  Trishiras  was  slain  by  Hanuman,  who 
was  equal  to  Shakra  in  valour,  the  monkeys  shouted  in  triumph 
and  the  earth  shook,  whilst  the  titans  scattered  on  all  sides. 

Beholding  Trishiras,  Yuddhonmatta  and  the  irresponsible 
Devantaka  and  Narantaka  slain,  the  fury  of  Matta  knew  no 
bounds.  Seizing  a  mace,  plated  with  gold,  stained  with  flesh, 
blood  and  foam,  immense,  glittering,  saturated  with  the  enemy's 
gore,  its  point  effulgent,  festooned  with  scarlet  garlands,  the 
terror  of  Airavata,  Mahapadma  and  Sarvabhauma,e  he  armed 
himself  with  that  weapon.  In  his  fury,  Matta,  that  lion  among 
the  titans,  scattered  the  monkeys  tike  the  Fire  at  the  end  of  the 
World  Period. 

Meanwhile  the  monkey,  Rishabha,  rushed  towards  Mattanika,3 
the  younger  brother  of  Ravana,  and  stood  courageously  facing 
him.  Beholding  that  monkey,  as  high  as  a  hill,  standing  before 
him,  Matta,  enraged,  struck  him  violently  on  the  chest  with  his 
mace  that  resembled  lightning.  Under  the  impact  of  that 
weapon,  the  lion  among  monkeys,  his  chest  riven,  stumbled, 
blood  flowing  in  streams  from  the  wound.  Regaining  conscious- 
ness after  a  long  time,  that  prince  of  the  monkeys,  his  lips 
trembling,  threw  a  savage  glance  at  Mahaparshwa  and,  with  a 
bound,  hurled  himself  on  that  titan ;  thereafter  the  impetuous 
leader  of  the  intrepid  monkeys,  of  the  size  of  a  mountain  in 
stature,  clenched  his  fist  and  struck  him  full  on  the  chest  and, 
tike  a  tree  whose  roots  have  been  severed,  the  titan  suddenly 
fell  to  the  earth,  his  limbs  streaming  with  blood.  Thereupon, 
Rishabha,  tore  that  terrible  mace  which  resembled  the  Rod  of 
Death,  from  his  grasp,  shouting  in  triumph.    For  an  instant 

1  Tashtri's  son.     The  son  of  Vishvanipa.

*  Another  name  of  Matta. 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

that  enemy  of  the  Gods  appeared  to  be  dead  but,  regaining  his 
senses,  his  colour  that  of  an  evening  cloud,  he  threw  himself 
on  the  son  of  the  Lord  of  Waters  and  struck  him. 

Dazed  by  the  shock,  the  monkey  sank  to  the  ground,  but, 
having  regained  consciousness,  quickly  rose  again,  and,  brandish- 
ing the  mace  resembling  a  huge  rock,  he  struck  the  titan  a  violent 
blow.  When  that  terrible  mace  fell  on  the  powerful  breast  of 
the  enemy  of  the  Gods,  hostile  to  sacrifice  and  the  priests,  from 
bis  riven  breast,  blood  fell  in  torrents,  as  mineral-charged  waters 
flow  from  a  mountain.  Thereafter  Rishabha,  still  armed  with 
that  formidable  weapon,  advanced  upon  him  rapidly,  striking 
bis  mighty  adversary  again  and  again  and  that  hero  felled 
Mattanika  in  the  forefront  of  the  battle  and,  crushed  by  his  own 
mace,  his  teeth  and  eyes  pressed  in,  Matta  sank  to  the  earth 
bereft  of  life  and  strength  like  a  rock  shattered  by  lightning. 

At  his  fall,  all  those  titan  warriors  fled  and,  Ravana's  brother 
being  slain,  the  whole  army  of  the  Nairritas,  which  was  as  vast 
as  the  sea,  throwing  away  their  weapons,  seeking  only  to  preserve 
their  lives,  scattered  in  all  directions  like  the  sea  bursting  its 
banks. 


CHAPTER    71 

Lakshmana  slays  the  Titan  Atikaya 

Witnessing  the  rout  of  his  great  army,  causing  the  hair  to  stand 
on  end,  and  the  death  of  his  brothers  the  equals  of  Shakra  in 
prowess  and,  beholding  his  two  uncles  Yuddhonmatta  and 
Matta,  the  foremost  of  the  titans,  struck  down  in  the  fight, 
the  illustrious  Atikaya,  who  resembled  a  rock,  the  humbler 
of  the  pride  of  Devas  and  Danavas,  he  who  had  been  favoured 
by  Brahma,  fell  into  a  transport  of  rage. 

Ascending  his  chariot,  glittering  like  a  hundred  suns,  that 
enemy  of  Indra  hurled  himself  on  the  monkeys  and,  stretching 
his  bow,  that  titan,  wearing  a  diadem  and  adorned  with  sparkling 
earrings,  proclaimed  his  name,  emitting  a  tremendous  shout. 
The  proclaiming  of  his  name,  the  leonine  roar  and  the  fearful 
twanging  of  his  bow-string  struck  terror  in  those  monkeys  and 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

they,  beholding  that  gigantic  warrior,  reflected : — '  Kumbha  karn  a 
has  come  again '  and,  in  their  panic,  took  shelter  one  with  the 
other.  At  the  sight  of  that  apparition,  like  unto  Vishnu  taking 
the  three  strides,  the  simian  warriors,  seized  with  fear,  fled  in 
all  directions  and  in  the  presence  of  Atikaya,  those  monkeys, 
bewildered,  sought  refuge  with  the  one  who  is  the  refuge  of  all, 
die  elder  brother  of  Lakshmana. 

At  that  instant,  Kakutstha  beheld  the  titan,  like  unto  a 
mountain,  standing  in  his  chariot,  afar  off,  armed  with  a  bow 
and  roaring  like  a  cloud  at  the  time  of  the  dissolution  of  the 
worlds.  Seeing  that  monster,  Raghava,  struck  with  astonish- 
ment, re-assuring  the  monkeys,  enquired  of  Bibishana,  saying: — 

"  Who  is  that  archer,  as  high  as  a  hill,  with  yellow  eyes, 
standing  in  his  vast  chariot,  harnessed  to  a  thousand  horses 
amidst  sharp  picks,  javelins,  gleaming  and  pointed  darts,  who 
shines  like  Maheshwara  among  the  Bhutas  and  who  is  surrounded 
by  guttering  spears  that  fill  his  car  like  tongues  of  the  Fire  of 
Death,  blazing  like  a  cloud  riven  by  lightning,  his  best  and 
golden-backed  bow  illumining  his  marvellous  car  on  all  sides,  as 
Shakra  in  the  heavens?  This  tiger  among  titans  diffuses  a 
brilliant  light  over  the  battlefield  as  he,  the  prince  of  warriors, 
advances  in  a  chariot  reflecting  the  sun's  rays.  On  the  point 
of  his  standard,  Rahu  has  lent  him  his  splendour1  and  his 
arrows  like  unto  the  rays  of  the  sun  light  up  the  ten  regions ; 
his  triply-curved  bow,  inlaid  and  backed  with  gold,  resounding 
like  thunder,  is  as  resplendent  as  Shatakratu's !  With  its 
standard,  banner,  carriage  and  the  four  outriders  who  escort  it, 
that  vast  chariot  thunders  like  a  storm  cloud.  Eight  and 
thirty  quivers  lie  in  the  car  with  dreadful  bows  furnished  with 
yellow  cords !  Two  shining  swords  illumine  its  sides,  their 
hafts  measuring  four  palms  and  they  are  assuredly  ten  palms 
in  length.  With  his  red  garlands,  this  hero  of  the  size  of  a 
mountain,  dark  of  hue,  his  great  mouth  like  unto  death,  resembles 
the  sun  veiled  by  cloud !  Who  is  this  titan  leader  with  his  arms 
loaded  with  golden  bracelets  ?  " 

Thus  questioned  by  Rama,  the  descendant  of  Raghu  of 
immense  energy,  the  extremely  illustrious  Bibishana  answered: — 

"  It  is  the  valiant  son  of  that  king  who  is  without  equal  in 

1  Rahu  being  his  emblem. 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

might,  Dasbagriva  of  great  splendour,  the  younger  brother  of 
Vaishravana  of  terrible  exploits,  the  mighty  Ravana,  Lord  of  the 
Titans.  Full  of  reverence  for  his  elders,  renowned  for  his 
strength,  the  most  skilful  of  those  versed  in  the  science  of  arms, 
he  is  able  to  fight  on  horseback  or  on  the  back  of  an  elephant, 
either  with  a  spear  or  bow  and,  whether  it  be  a  question  of 
destruction  or  of  sowing  dissension  or  of  making  peace,  of 
bestowing  gifts,  of  using  diplomacy  or  of  strategy,  he  is  highly 
esteemed.  His  mother  was  Dhanyamalini  and  he  is  named 
Atikaya. 

"  Having  found  favour  with  Brahma  through  his  chastity  and 
austerity,  he  has  obtained  possession  of  marvellous  weapons 
with  which  he  has  overcome  his  enemies  and  Swyambhu  granted 
him  invulnerability  to  Gods  and  Danavas  and  bestowed  this 
celestial  armour  on  him  and  a  chariot  reflecting  the  sun's  rays. 
A  hundred  times  has  he  triumphed  over  Gods  and  Danavas, 
rescued  the  titans  and  exterminated  the  Yakshas.  In  battle, 
that  intrepid  warrior  stayed  Indra's  thunderbolt  with  his  darts 
and  repelled  the  noose  belonging  to  the  Lord  of  the  Waters, 
Varuna.  He,  Atikaya,  the  most  powerful  of  the  titans  is  the 
intelligent  son  of  Ravana  and  the  subduer  of  the  pride  of  Devas 
and  Danavas.  Speedily  direct  thine  efforts  against  him,  O 
Lion  among  Men,  lest,  with  his  arrows,  he  annihilate  the 
monkey  race ! " 

At  that  instant,  the  mighty  Atikaya,  shouting  again  and  again, 
stretching  his  bow,  hurled  himself  on  the  monkey  host. 

Beholding  that  fearful  monster,  standing  in  his  chariot,  the 
greatest  of  car  warriors,  the  foremost  of  the  illustrious  monkey 
leaders  advanced  to  meet  him,  and  Kumuda,  Mainda,  Nila  and 
Sharabha,  corning  together,  also  went  out  with  trees  and  rocks. 

Then  that  mighty  titan,  prince  of  warriors,  broke  those  rocks 
and  trees  and  all  the  monkeys  resisted  him,  but  that  virtuous 
hero  of  appalling  stature,  pierced  them  with  iron  darts.  Over- 
whelmed by  that  hail  of  missiles,  their  limbs  dislocated, 
demoralized,  they  were  unable  to  endure  the  furious  assaults  of 
Atikaya  and  that  hero  sowed  terror  amidst  the  hosts  of  the 
valiant  monkeys,  as  a  lion,  proud  of  its  youth  and  strength, 
stands  amongst  a  herd  of  deer ;  nevertheless  that  Indra  among 
the  titans  desisted  from  striking  any  who  were  defenceless. 
203 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Thereafter  with  his  bow  and  quiver,  be  rushed  on  Rama  and 
addressed  him  proudly,  saying : — 

*'  Here  I  stand  in  my  chariot  with  my  bow  and  arrows  in  my 
hand !  I  do  not  contend  with  common  soldiers  but  he,  who 
desires  it  and  is  willing,  I  challenge,  here  and  now,  to  combat !  " 

This  speech  incensed  Saumitri,  the  slayer  of  his  foes,  and, 
in  his  rage,  he  sprang  forward  with  a  smile  of  disdain,  bow  in 
hand.  Provoked,  he  advanced,  taking  an  arrow  from  his  quiver 
and  placing  himself  before  Atikaya,  stretching  his  great  bow  so 
that  the  earth,  the  sky,  the  sea  and  the  four  quarters  resounded 
with  the  formidable  thrumming  of  the  bowstring  and  terror 
seized  those  rangers  of  the  night. 

Hearing  that  dreadful  twanging  of  Saumitri's  bow,  the 
powerful  and  valiant  son  of  that  Indra  of  Titans  was  astounded 
and,  enraged  on  beholding  Lakshmana  advancing  towards  him, 
he  took  out  a  sharp  dart  and  spoke  thus  : — 

"  Go  hence,  O  Saumitri,  thou  art  but  a  child  without  any 
experience  of  warfare ;  why  dost  thou  seek  to  measure  thy 
strength  with  mine,  who  am  the  equal  of  Death !  Nay, 
assuredly  the  force  of  these  arrows  loosed  by  mine  arm  may  not 
be  withstood  by  Himavat  himself  nor  the  earth  nor  the  heavens. 
Thou  art  seeking  to  rouse  the  Fire  of  Dissolution  which,  to  thy 
good  fortune,  is  now  sleeping.  Throw  away  thy  bow  and  go 
hence !  Do  not  sacrifice  thy  life  by  advancing  to  meet  me ! 
Nevertheless  if  thou  art  determined  not  to  turn  back  then  stay 
and,  yielding  up  thy  life,  enter  Yama's  abode !  Behold  my 
whetted  shafts,  which  wroughtof  refined  gold,  subdue  the  boasting 
of  mine  adversaries  and  resemble  Shiva's  trident.  This  arrow 
also,  resembling  a  serpent,  shall  this  instant  quaff  thy  blood  as 
the  king  of  the  beasts  drinks  the  blood  of  the  lord  of  the 
elephants. " 

Speaking  thus,  in  rage,  the  titan  placed  an  arrow  on  his  bow 
and  that  speech  of  Atikaya's,fuH  of  wrath  and  threats,  infuriated 
Lakshmana  who  was  brave  and  virtuous  by  nature  so  that 
he  answered  him  proudly  and  with  dignity,  saying : — 

"  Superiority  is  not  measured  by  speech  nor  is  bragging 

indulged  in  by  men  of  worth  !     Here  I  am  armed  with  my  bow, 

an  arrow  in  mine  hand,  manifest  thy  prowess,  O  Wretch  I 

Reveal  thyself  in  deeds  and  cease  to  blow  thine  own  trumpet ! 

304 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

He  who  conducts  himself  with  courage  is  said  to  be  a  warrior  ! 
Thou  art  furnished  with  every  kind  of  weapon*  art  mounted  on 
thy  chariot  and  hast  a  bow ;  now  manifest  thy  valour  either 
with  arrows  or  with  magic  darts !  I  shall  cut  off  thine  head 
with  my  whetted  shafts  as  the  wind  detaches  the  ripe  fruit  of  the 
palm  from  its  stem !  Soon  mine  arrows,  decorated  with  refined 
gold,  shall  drink  thy  blood,  that  their  points  will  cause  to  flow  by 
piercing  thy  limbs.  Thou  hast  said  '  He  is  but  a  child '  but 
let  not  this  thought  cause  thee  to  underestimate  me.  Old  or 
young,  know  that  it  is  death  who  is  about  to  enter  into  combat 
with  thee.  Vishnu,  while  yet  a  child,  covered  the  Three 
Worlds  in  his  three  strides  !  " 

These  words  of  Lakshmana,  fraught  with  sense  and  reason, 
exasperated  Atikaya,  who  laid  hold  of  an  excellent  dart.  At 
this,  Vidyadharas,  Bhutas,  Devas,  Daityas,  Maharishis  and 
Guhyakas  of  great  soul,  gathered  to  witness  the  duel. 

Thereafter  Atikaya,  provoked,  placed  an  arrow  on  his  bow 
and  loosed  it  on  Lakshmana  and  it  ate  up  space,  as  it  were, 
but  that  sharpened  arrow  like  unto  a  venomous  snake,  in  the 
form  of  a  crescent,  as  it  flew  was  severed  by  that  slayer  of  his 
foes  and,  seeing  his  dart  broken,  Atikaya,  in  a  paroxysm  of 
rage  took  out  five  arrows  at  once,  and  that  ranger  of  the  night 
loosed  them  on  Lakshmana,  but  before  they  reached  him,  the 
younger  brother  of  Bharata  shattered  them  with  his  whetted 
shafts. 

Having  severed  those  missiles  with  his  sharpened  darts, 
Lakshmana,  the  slayer  of  his  foes,  selected  a  pointed  arrow,  the 
brilliance  of  which  sent  forth  flames  and  placed  it  on  his  excellent 
bow,  then  bending  it  with  force,  he  struck  the  forehead  of  that 
prince  of  the  titans. 

That  shaft,  sinking  into  the  brow  of  the  terrible  titan  with  the 
blood  that  covered  it,  resembled  the  King  of  the  Serpents 
entering  a  mountain  and,  as  the  formidable  gateway  of  Tripura 
shook,  when  struck  by  Rudra's  shaft,  so  did  that  titan  falter 
at  the  impact  of  Lakshmana's  weapon.  Breathing  heavily,  that 
colossus  reflected  *  Assuredly  the  arrow  thus  loosed  proves  to 
me  that  thou  art  a  worthy  adversary !  *  Thinking  thus,  he 
opened  his  mouth  and,  stretching  his  great  arms,  leaning  on  his 
seat,  urged  his  chariot  forward.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

One,  three,  five  and  seven  were  the  arrows  selected  by  that 
lion  among  the  titans  and,  placing  them  on  his  bow  and  drawing 
it,  he  let  them  fly  and  those  shafts,  bright  as  the  sun,  seemed  as 
it  were  to  set  the  firmament  ablaze.  Meantime,  unmoved,  the 
younger  brother  of  Raghava  severed  them  with  the  aid  of 
innumerable  whetted  darts.  Seeing  those  arrows  broken,  the 
son  of  Ravana,  enemy  of  the  Lord  of  the  Gods,  incensed,  took 
hold  of  a  sharp  weapon  and,  placing  it  on  his  bow,  he  loosed  it 
with  great  force  against  Saumitri,  who  was  advancing  towards 
him,  striking  him  on  the  breast.  Wounded  in  the  breast  by 
Atikaya,  Saumitri  began  to  bleed  profusely,  like  an  elephant 
discharging  its  temporal  juices,  and  that  prince  plucked  out  the 
shaft  and  threw  it  away ;  thereafter  he  selected  a  sharp  dart  to 
which  he  joined  a  mantra-charged  arrow  and  set  Agni's  weapon 
on  his  bow  whereupon  both  bow  and  arrow  spat  forth  flames. 
Thereupon  Atikaya,  endowed  with  great  strength,  took  up 
Rudra's  weapon  and  fixed  an  arrow  with  a  golden  haft,  re- 
sembling a  serpent,  on  his  bow. 

Then  Lakshmana  loosed  that  powerful  weapon,  his  flaming 
and  redoubtable  missile  on  Atikaya  like  Antaka  wielding  the 
Rod  of  Death.  Seeing  that  shaft  joined  to  the  Agneya  dart 
the  Ranger  of  the  Night  loosed  Rudra's  shaft  joined  to  Surya's 
weapon,  and  those  two  missiles  rushed  towards  each  other  in 
space  and  their  flaming  points  made  them  appear  like  infuriated 
serpents.  Devouring  each  other,  they  fell  on  the  earth,  their 
fire  extinguished,  reduced  to  ashes  and  bereft  of  their  splendour, 
and  having  set  the  sky  ablaze,  they  lay  without  lustre  on  the 
earth. 

Thereafter  Atikaya,  enraged,  discharged  the  Aishika  Reed 
joined  to  Twashtar's  Weapon,  but  the  mighty  Saumitri  severed 
it  with  Indra's  shaft.  Seeing  the  reed  broken,  that  prince  born 
of  Ravana,  enraged,  joined  a  spear  to  Yama's  Weapon  and  that 
ranger  of  the  night  hurled  it  at  Lakshmana  who  destroyed  it 
with  the  Vayavya  Weapon. 

Then,  like  a  mass  of  cloud  letting  loose  its  rain,  Lakshmana, 
in  anger,  covered  the  son  of  Ravana  with  a  rain  of  missiles  and 
those  shafts  coming  in  contact  with  Atikaya's  coat  of  mail  which 
was  encrusted  with  diamonds,  had  their  points  shattered  and 
fell  on  the  earth.  Seeing  them  rendered  fruitless  Lakshmana, 
206 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

the  slayer  of  hostile  warriors,  covered  his  adversary  with  a 
thousand  arrows.  Inundated  by  that  hail  of  shafts,  Atikaya, 
that  mighty  warrior,  whose  cuirass  could  not  be  pierced, 
remained  unmoved  and  that  hero  was  unable  to  inflict  a  wound 
on  the  titan. 

Thereafter  the  Wind-god  approached  him  and  said : — 
"  Because  of  the  boon  received  from  Brahma,  that  warrior  is 
clothed  in  impenetrable  armour,  do  thou  therefore  strike  him 
with  the  Brahma  Weapon,  else  he  may  not  be  slain,  his  mail 
being  proof  against  aught  else !  " 

On  hearing  Vayu's  words,  Saumitri,  the  equal  of  Indra  in 
prowess,  instantly  took  up  a  dart  of  incredible  velocity  and 
joined  it  to  Brahma's  Weapon.  Having  placed  that  excellent 
weapon  with  the  foremost  of  arrows  furnished  with  sharp  points 
on  his  bow,  every  region,  the  sun,  moon  and  the  great  planets  were 
struck  with  terror  and  the  heavens  and  earth  also  shook.  Then, 
having  fixed  the  Brahma  Weapon  on  his  bow,  that  missile,  the 
stem  of  which  being  like  death's  messenger  and  equal  to  lightning, 
Saumitri  let  it  fly  on  the  son  of  Indra's  foe.  And  Atikaya 
beheld  that  shaft  loosed  by  the  mighty-armed  Lakshmana, 
swift  as  the  tempest,  with  its  haft  encrusted  with  gold  and 
diamonds,  falling  upon  him  and  beholding  it,  immediately 
struck  at  it  with  his  innumerable  shafts  but  that  arrow,  swift 
as  Suparna  himself,  flew  towards  him  with  extreme  velocity  and 
seeing  it  draw  near,  like  Death  at  the  time  of  dissolution, 
Atikaya  struck  at  it  with  lances,  spears,  maces,  axes,  picks  and 
arrows  with  unrelenting  energy,  but  those  weapons  of  marvellous 
aspect  were  rendered  fruitless  by  that  flaming  dart,  which, 
striking  him,  severed  his  head  with  its  diadem. 

Cut  off  by  Lakshmana's  arrow,  the  head  instantly  fell  on  the 
earth  with  its  crown  like  unto  the  peak  of  Himavat.  Then 
those  rangers  of  the  night,  who  had  escaped  the  slaughter, 
beholding  the  body  lying  on  the  ground,  its  raiment  and  adorn- 
ments in  disarray,  were  thunderstruck  and,  their  features 
distored,  those  unfortunate  beings,  exhausted  with  fighting, 
suddenly  began  to  emit  piercing  and  inarticulate  cries.  There- 
after those  titans,  who  surrounded  their  dead  leader,  terrified, 
without  paying  him  honour,  fled  towards  the  city. 

The  monkeys,  however,  their  faces  shining  like  full-blown 
207 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

lotuses,  in  their  delight,  all  paid  homage  to  Lakshmana  on 
account  of  the  success  he  had  won  in  striking  down  that 
formidable  adversary  who  was  renowned  for  his  prowess  and 
theretofore  invincible. 


CHAPTER    72 

Ravana,  overcome  by  anxiety,  makes  further  Plans 

Hearing  that  Atikaya  had  been  slain  by  the  mighty  Lakshmana, 
Ravana  became  extremely  anxious  and  spoke  as  follows  : — 

"  Dhumraksha,  who  is  full  of  ardour  and  the  most  skilled  in 
the  use  of  arms,  Akampana,  Prahasta,  and  Kumbhakarna,  those 
valiant  titan  warriors  eager  for  combat,  the  destroyers  of  hostile 
forces,  ever  invincible,  brave  titans  of  immense  stature  who  were 
versed  in  the  use  of  every  weapon,  have  fallen  with  their  troops 
under  the  blows  of  Rama  of  imperishable  exploits.  Yet  many 
powerful  warriors  were  struck  down  by  my  son  Indrajita,  who 
is  renowned  for  his  strength  and  prowess ;  those  two  brothers 
were  fettered  by  his  formidable  shafts  bestowed  on  us  as  a  boon. 
All  the  Gods  and  Asuras  combined,  despite  their  power,  could 
not  have  broken  those  fearful  bonds,  nor  the  Yakshas,  Gand- 
harvas  or  Pannagas !  I  do  not  know  by  what  force,  magic  or 
supernatural  means,  those  bonds  were  severed  by  those  two 
brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana. 

"  Those  courageous  titans,  who  went  out  to  fight  at  my 
command,  have  all  perished  in  combat  with  the  exceedingly 
valiant  monkeys.  Henceforth  I  do  not  see  who,  on  the  battle- 
field, will  be  able  to  slay  Rama  and  Lakshmana  or  the  powerful 
Sugriva  and  his  forces. 

"  Ah  !  How  mighty  is  Rama  !  How  great  is  the  range  of  his 
shafts!  Those  titans,  who  challenged  this  warrior,  have  all 
been  destroyed  !  Now,  on  bis  account,  let  defences  be  set  up 
everywhere,  both  in  the  city  and  round  the  Ashoka  Grove  where 
Sita  is  being  guarded.  Let  the  entries  and  exits  be  patrolled 
continuously  by  our  sentinels,  wherever  they  are  posted ! 
Establish  yourselves  with  the  foremost  battalions  everywhere 
208 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

in  order  to  observe  the  movements  of  the  monkeys,  O  Night- 
rangers  !  In  the  evening,  at  midnight  or  at  dawn,  no  matter 
when,  do  not  relax  your  vigilance  in  regard  to  the  simian  army. 
Observe  what  troops  are  placed  in  the  line  by  the  enemy,  how 
they  advance  and  where  they  halt ;  let  the  gateways  and  turrets 
be  barricaded  at  once  !  " 

All  the  titans  listened  to  the  commands  of  the  mighty  Lord 
of  the  Titans  and  went  away  to  carry  them  out.  Ravana,  the 
King  of  the  Titans,  however,  having  issued  these  orders, 
exceedingly  despondent,  entered  his  abode,  the  fire  of  his  anger 
smouldering  within  him,  and  that  powerful  monarch  of  those 
rangers  of  the  night,  reflecting  on  the  misfortune  that  had 
befallen  his  son,  sighed  without  ceasing. 


chapter  73 

Indrajita  making  Himself  invisible  puts  the  Monkey  Army  out  of 
action 

The  titans,  who  had  escaped  the  slaughter,  hastened  to  apprise 
Ravana  of  the  death  of  their  leaders,  Devantaka  and  others,  as 
also  Trishiras  and  Atikaya. 

Hearing  these  mournful  tidings,  great  tears  immediately  filled 
the  king's  eyes  and  for  a  long  time  he  remained  absorbed  in 
the  melancholy  thought  of  the  death  of  his  sons  and  brothers. 

Beholding  the  wretched  monarch  plunged  in  an  ocean  of 
grief,  Indrajita  the  son  of  that  Lord  of  the  Titans,  the  foremost 
of  warriors,  addressed  him  thus  : — 

"  O  My  Dear  Father,  since  Indrajita  still  lives,  do  not  give 
thyself  up  to  despair !  O  Prince  of  the  Nairritas,  he  whom  the 
enemy  of  Indra  strikes  with  his  shafts  in  the  fight  is  not  able 
to  preserve  his  life.  To-day  thou  shalt  see  Rama  and  Laksh- 
mana  lying  stretched  on  the  earth,  their  bodies  pierced,  torn 
to  pieces  by  mine  arrows,  their  limbs  riddled  with  my  whetted 
shafts.  Bear  witness  to  the  well-considered  vow  of  Shakra's 
enemy  re-inforced  by  my  prowess  and  the  divine  power ! 
This  very  day  I  shall  overwhelm  Rama  and  Lakshmana  with 
ao9 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

arrows  that  never  miss  their  target.  Let  Indra,  Vaivasvata, 
Vishnu,  Rudra,  the  Sadhyas,  Vaishvanara,  Chandra  and  Surya 
this  day  witness  mine  immeasurable  piowess  as  redoubtable 
as  that  of  Vishnu  at  Bali's  place  of  sacrifice !  " 

Having  spoken  thus,  that  rival  of  the  Lord  of  the  Celestials, 
craved  permission  of  the  king  to  depart  and  with  fearless  soul 
ascended  his  chariot,  that  was  as  swift  as  the  wind,  harnessed 
to  excellent  steeds  and  furnished  with  weapons,  resembling 
the  car  of  Hari  himself.  Then  he  set  out  for  the  battlefield 
immediately  and  that  magnanimous  hero  was  escorted  by 
innumerable  warriors,  full  of  ardour,  bearing  great  bows  in 
their  hands. 

As  they  advanced,  some  on  the  backs  of  elephants,  others 
on  prodigious  mounts  such  as  tigers,  scorpions,  cats,  mules, 
buffalo,  serpents,  boars,  cheetahs,  lions  and  jackals,  as  large  as 
hills,  crows,  herons  and  peacocks,  those  titans  of  redoubtable 
courage  were  armed  with  javelins,  hammers,  sabres,  axes  and 
maces.  To  the  sound  of  conches  and  the  rolling  of  drums, 
that  valiant  enemy  of  the  King  of  the  Gods  rushed  out  to  fight. 
With  his  parasol,  pearly  like  the  moon,  that  slayer  of  his  foes 
shone  like  the  firmament  when  that  orb  is  full.  Fanned  by 
marvellous  chowries  with  elegant  handles,  that  warrior,  adorned 
with  golden  ornaments,  the  foremost  of  archers,  Indrajita,  blazed 
like  the  solar  disc  and  he,  whose  strength  was  irresistible, 
illumined  Lanka  like  the  burning  sun  in  the  sky.  Then  that 
intrepid  subduer  of  bis  foes,  on  reaching  the  battlefield,  ranged 
the  titans  round  his  chariot  and,  according  to  the  traditional 
rites,  that  Prince  of  the  Titans  prayed  to  the  God  who  feeds 
on  sacrificial  offerings,1  whose  brilliance  he  possessed,  reciting 
the  most  auspicious  mantras,  and,  offering  libations  of  Soma 
and  roasted  grain,  with  garlands  and  perfumes,  that  resplendent 
leader  of  the  titans  invoked  Pavaka. 

Thereafter  he  brought  there  weapons  such  as  Sharapatras, 
Samidhs  and  Bibhitakas  with  red  robes  and  an  iron  spoon  and, 
heaping  the  fire  with  Sharapatras  and  Tomaras,  he  seized  hold 
of  a  live  goat  by  the  neck. 

Blazing  up  suddenly  the  fire  gave  off  no  smoke  but  manifested 
the  signs  betokening  victory  and,  having  been  lit,  the  flames 

1  The  God  of  Fire,  Pavaka  or  Agni. 

2X0 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

bright  as  gold,  whirling  in  a  southerly  direction,  passed  through 
the  crucible  and  instantly  consumed  the  offerings. 

Thereafter  Indrajita,  who  was  skilled  in  handling  arms,  took 
out  the  Brahma-weapon  and  pronounced  a  mantram  on  his  bow, 
his  chariot  and  on  all.  Then  he,  having  uttered  the  sacred 
formula  and  invoked  Pavaka,  the  firmament,  the  sun,  the  planets, 
the  moon  and  the  stars,  trembled.  Having  called  on  the  God  of 
Fire,  whose  brilliance  he  possessed,  he,  the  equal  of  Indra  in 
power,  whose  strength  was  unimaginable,  disappeared  in  the  sky 
with  his  bow,  arrows,  sword,  chariot,  horses  and  spear. 

Then  the  army  of  titans,  abundantly  furnished  with  horses 
and  chariots,  flags  and  pennants,  burning  to  fight,  set  out 
emitting  war  cries  and,  in  the  struggle,  those  titans,  full  of  rage, 
attacked  the  monkeys  with  darts  of  different  kinds  which  were 
sharp,  swift  and  beautifully  wrought,  and  with  spears  and  hooks. 
Beholding  them,  the  son  of  Ravana,  addressing  those  rangers  of 
the  night,  cried  out : — "  Attack  the  foe  speedily  whom  you  are 
burning  to  destroy !    Be  of  good  cheer !  " 

At  these  words,  the  titans,  in  their  anxiety  to  triumph,  roared 
aloud  and  caused  a  hail  of  missiles  to  descend  on  those  re- 
doubtable monkeys.  Arming  himself  with  arrows,1  maces  and 
clubs,  Indrajita,  on  his  side,  in  the  midst  of  the  titans,  assaulted 
the  monkeys  from  where  he  stood  invisible  in  the  sky. 

Then  those  monkeys,  struck  down  in  the  fight,  instantly  began 
to  assail  Ravani  with  blows  from  stones  and  trees  and,  full  of 
anger,  Indrajita,  born  of  Ravana,  that  hero  full  of  power,  smote 
the  monkeys  with  a  single  lance  and,  in  fierce  fury,  pierced  five, 
seven  and  nine  monkeys  at  one  time  to  the  great  delight  of  the 
titans.  Thereafter  that  invincible  warrior  crushed  those 
monkeys  under  his  shafts  that  glittered  like  the  sun  and  were 
decorated  with  gold. 

Their  limbs  pierced,  the  monkeys,  overwhelmed  by  those 
arrows,  fell  like  great  Asuras  destroyed  by  the  Gods.  Before 
this  second  Aditya  who  consumed  them  with  those  formidable 
weapons  as  his  rays,  those  lions  among  the  monkeys  fled  away, 
filled  with  terror.  Their  bodies  mutilated,  their  senses  confused, 
they  stampeded,  bathed  in  blood  and  terrified  but,  in  their 

1  Different  kinds  of  arrows  such  as  Nalikas  and  Navachas.  See  Weapons 

Glossary. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

devotion  to  Rama,  those  monkeys,  willing  to  sacrifice  their  lives. 
suddenly  halted  and  returned  shouting,  armed  with  rocks, 
and,  closing  their  ranks,  showered  down  a  hail  of  trees,  crags  and 
stones  on  Ravani. 

That  murderous  and  fearful  avalanche  of  trees  and  rocks  was 
however  dispersed  by  the  mighty  Indrajita,  who  was  ever 
victorious  in  combat  and,  with  his  arrows  as  bright  as  fire, 
resembling  serpents,  that  prince  pierced  the  ranks  of  his  foes. 
With  eighteen  penetrating  darts  he  wounded  Gandhamadana ; 
with  nine  others  he  struck  Nala,  who  stood  some  way  off,  and, 
in  his  great  strength,  he  assailed  Mainda  with  seven  arrows, 
tearing  out  his  entrails,  and  Gaja  with  seven  blunted  shafts. 
Thereafter  he  pierced  Jambavan  with  ten  arrows,  Nila  with 
thirty  and  Sugriva,  Rishabha,  Angada  and  Dvivida  with  dreadful 
flaming  arrows  that  had  been  received  as  boons,  thus  rendering 
those  foremost  of  the  monkeys  insensible,  who,  struck  by 
innumerable  shafts  fell  under  his  furious  onslaught  so  that  he 
appeared  like  the  Fire  of  Death  itself. 

With  the  aid  of  arrows  as  bright  as  the  sun,  loosed  with  skill, 
that  were  exceedingly  swift,  he  scattered  those  monkey  divisions 
in  that  great  fight  and,  with  transports  of  the  keenest  joy,  that 
renowned  warrior,  born  of  the  Indra  of  the  Titans,  witnessed 
the  entire  simian  army,  bathed  in  blood,  overwhelmed  with  that 
rain  of  missiles. 

Under  that  shower  of  arrows  and  cruel  hail  of  weapons  with 
which  he  assailed  them,  the  valiant  Indrajita  ranged  the  monkey 
ranks  spreading  destruction.  Then,  leaving  his  army  behind, 
he  speedily  flung  himself  on  the  monkey  forces  in  that  great 
fight,  covering  them  with  a  huge  wave  of  formidable  shafts  like 
the  downpour  from  a  dark  cloud. 

Victims  of  his  magic  arts,  their  bodies  crushed  by  those  missiles 
loosed  by  that  vanquisher  of  Shakra,  the  monkeys,  who  were  as 
large  as  rocks,  emitted  piteous  cries,  falling  in  the  fray  like  great 
hills  struck  by  Indra's  thunderbolt,  and  they  could  see  nothing 
but  those  sharp  arrows  decimating  their  ranks,  whilst  the  enemy 
of  the  King  of  the  Gods,  that  titan,  veiled  in  his  magic  power, 
remained  invisible.  Then  that  illustrious  Prince  of  the  Titans 
let  fly  his  whetted  shafts  that  shone  like  the  sun  in  all  directions 
covering  the  foremost  of  the  monkeys  and  destroying  them j 

213 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

and  he  caused  spears,  swords  and  axes  resembling  fire,  shooting 
forth  flames  like  a  glowing  brazier  from  which  sparks  fly,  to  fall 
on  the  ranks  of  the  foremost  of  the  Plavagas.  Under  the  arrows 
and  flaming  darts,  with  which  the  vanquisher  of  Indra  over- 
whelmed them,  the  monkey  leaders  resembled  Kimshuka  Trees 
in  full  flower. 

As  they  looked  upwards,  some,  struck  in  the  eyes  were 
blinded,  and  jostling  one  another,  fell  to  the  earth.  With  the  aid 
of  javelins,  spears  and  whetted  shafts  charged  with  mantras, 
Indrajita,  the  Prince  of  the  Titans,  crushed  all  those  warriors, 
Hanuman,  Sugriva,  Angada,  Gandhamadana,  Jambavan, 
Sushena,  Vegadarshin,  Mainda,  Dvivida,  Nila,  Gavaksha, 
Gavaya,  Kesarin,  Hariloman,  Vidyuddamshtra,  Suryanana, 
Jyotimukha,  Dadbimukha,  Pavakaksha,  Nala  and  Kumuda  and, 
having  disarmed  those  monkey  leaders,  he  caused  a  shower  of 
glittering  darts,  like  unto  the  rays  of  the  sun,  to  fall  on  Rama,  and 
Lakshmana  who  accompanied  him. 

Under  the  wave  of  arrows,  which  he  heeded  as  little  as  though 
they  were  drops  of  rain,  Rama,  of  prodigious  splendour  began 
to  ponder  within  himself  and  said  to  his  brother  : — 

"  O  Lakshmana,  having  overwhelmed  the  simian  army,  that 
Indra  among  the  Titans,  the  enemy  of  the  Gods,  trusting  in  his 
powerful  weapon,  now  attacks  us  afresh  with  his  sharp  darts ! 
In  virtue  of  the  boon  he  has  received  from  Swyambhu,  that 
hero,  full  of  energy  and  prowess,  has  made  himself  invisible 
despite  his  formidable  size.  How  may  Indrajita,  who  has  taken 
up  arms  against  us,  be  struck  down  in  combat  when  his  body  is 
invisible  ? 

"  I  recognize  this  to  be  the  weapon  and  power  of  Swyambhu, 
the  Beneficent  and  Incomprehensible  One !  With  a  tranquil 
heart,  O  Sagacious  Lakshmana,  bear  the  fall  of  this  shaft  with 
me  to-day  !  Let  this  Indra  of  Titans,  the  leader  of  them  all, 
cover  us  with  a  rain  of  darts  !  The  entire  army  of  the  Monkey 
King,  his  greatest  warriors  having  been  struck  down,  appears 
to  have  lost  its  splendour,  yet  when  Ravani  beholds  us  lying 
stretched  insensible  and  impotent,  manifesting  neither  joy  nor 
anger,  he  will  certainly  rejoin  Ravana,  the  enemy  of  the  Gods, 
in  his  abode,  having  gained  a  great  victory." 

Thereafter  Indrajita,  overwhelmed  them  both  with  a  hail  of 

p  213 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

missiles  and,  having  reduced  them  to  a  state  of  impotence,  that 
Indra  among  the  Titans  set  up  a  shout  of  triumph. 

In  this  way,  having  overcome  the  simian  army  in  battle,  as 
also  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  he  returned  at  once  to  the  city  ruled 
by  Ravana's  hand  where,  extolled  by  the  Yatudhanas  and  filled 
with  delight,  he  related  all  to  his  sire.

Seeing  the  two  Raghavas  lying  unconscious  on  the  field,  the 
army  of  monkeys  and  their  leaders  lost  courage,  nor  did  Sugriva, 
Nila,  Angada  or  Jambavan  dare  to  take  any  action. 

Thereupon  Bibishana,  foremost  among  the  wise,  seeing  the 
general  despondency,  with  his  sagacious  words  re-assured  those 
warriors  belonging  to  the  simian  king,  saying : — 

"  Although  those  two  princes  are  lying  here  without  con- 
sciousness, have  no  fear,  you  have  no  cause  to  despair ;  it  is  in 
order  to  honour  Swyambhu's  pledge  that  they  have  allowed 
themselves  to  be  struck  down  by  Indrajha  with  his  rain  of 
missiles  !  Indrajita  received  that  excellent  weapon  that  is  not 
to  be  withstood  from  Brahma.  It  is  in  order  to  render  homage 
to  that  God  that  the  two  princes  have  fallen  in  the  fight ;  it  is 
therefore  not  the  moment  to  lose  heart !  " 

Having  paid  honour  to  Brahma's  weapon,  Marutj  answered 
Bibishana,  saying : — 

"  Let  us  console  those  who  still  live  among  the  army  of  the 
monkeys,  which  has  been  decimated  by  that  celestial  shaft." 

Thereupon,  with  torches  in  their  hands,  those  two  heroes, 
Hanuman  and  the  foremost  of  the  titans,  began  to  range  the 
battlefield  together  during  the  night,  and  they  beheld  the  earth 
covered  with  tails,  hands,  breasts,  feet,  fingers,  necks  and  severed 
limbs,  scattered  here  and  there,  from  which  the  blood  Sowed, 
and  monkeys  as  large  as  hills  fallen  on  the  field,  their  weapons 
still  glowing.

Thereafter  Bibishana  and  Hanuman  beheld  Sugriva,  Angada, 
Nila,  Sharabha,  Gandhamadana,  Jambavan,  Sushena, 
Vegadarshin  as  also  Mainda,  Nala,  Jyotimukha,  Dvivida  and 
all  those  monkeys  lying  on  the  battlefield.  Seventy-six  kotis 
of  brave  monkeys  had  been  overthrown  in  the  fifth  and  last 
period  of  the  day  by  Brahma's  cherished  weapon. 

While  looking  on  that  formidable  army,  that  had  fallen  under 
the  blows  of  the  enemy  and  that  resembled  the  waters  of  the  sea, 
Hanuman,  accompanied  by  Bibishana,  began  to  search  for 
Jambavan  and,  beholding  that  aged  one,  bowed  with  the  weight 
of  years,  riddled  with  a  hundred  arrows,  the  valiant  son  of 
Prajapati,  like  unto  an  extinguished  brazier,  the  grandson  of 
Poulastya1  rushed  towards  him  and  said : — 

"  O  Hero,  is  it  possible  that  those  penetrating  shafts  did  not 
cut  off  thine  existence  ?  " 

Hearing  the  voice  of  Bibishana,  Jambavan,  the  foremost 
of  the  bears,  who  was  scarcely  able  to  speak,  answered 
saying: — 

"  O  Indra  among  the  Nairritas,  thou  who  art  full  of  valour, 
I  recognize  thy  voice,  O  Pious  One,  say  whether  he,  on  account 
of  whom  Anjana  and  Matarishwan  are  happy  parents,  that  hero, 
Hanuman,  still  lives  ?  " 

On  this  enquiry  from  Jambavan,  Bibishana  replied  : — 
"  Why  dost  thou  remain  silent  concerning  the  two  princes  and 
question  me  on  the  subject  of  Maruti  ?  How  is  it  that  King 
Sugriva,  Angada  or  even  Raghava  do  not  inspire  thee  with  an 
affection  as  great  as  that  which  thou  bearest  for  the  son  of  Vayu, 
O  Venerable  One  ?  " 

Hearing  Bibishana's  words,  Jambavan  answered : — "  Hear, 
O  Tiger  among  the  Nairritas,  as  to  why  I  enquire  concerning 
Maruti ;  it  is,  that  should  the  valiant  Hanuman  still  live,  even 
if  the  army  has  been  destroyed,  it  is  not  destroyed !  If  Maruti 
yet  lives,  O  Dear  Friend,  he,  the  rival  of  Maruta,  the  equal  of 
Vaishvanara  in  power,  then  there  is  still  the  possibility  of 
survival ! " 

At  that  moment  the  son  of  Maruta  approached  that  venerable 
one  with  reverence,  paying  obeisance  to  him  and  touching  his 

1  Poulastya — Havana  and  his  younger  brother  Bibishana  were  descended 
from  the  Sage  Poulastya.

feet  and  the  voice  of  Hanuman  moved  his  heart,  so  that  the 
Prince  of  the  Plavagas  felt  new  life  had  been  bestowed  on  him. 
Thereafter  the  illustrious  Jambavan  said  to  Hanuman : — 
"  Come  hither,  O  Mighty  One,  it  is  for  thee  to  deliver  the 
monkeys,  none  other  has  the  power  and  thou  art  their  best 
friend.  This  is  the  moment  to  demonstrate  thy  prowess,  I 
see  no  other ;  do  thou  bring  joy  to  those  brave  troops  of  bears 
and  monkeys !  Heal  those  two  unfortunate  beings,  Rama  and 
Lakshmana  of  their  wounds.  Prepare  to  cross  far  above  the 
great  path  of  the  ocean  in  order  to  reach  Himavat,  the  highest  of 
mountains,  O  Hanuman,  and  there  direct  thy  course  to  that 
golden  Peak  Rishabha,  difficult  to  scale  and  of  an  extreme 
altitude.  There  the  summit  of  Mount  Kailasha  will  be  seen 
by  thee,  O  Slayer  of  Thy  Foes  !  Between  the  peaks  of  these 
two  mountains,  thou  wilt  behold  the  mountain  of  medicinal 
herbs  rising  in  unparalleled  splendour,  where  every  kind  of 
healing  plant  abounds.  O  Foremost  of  the  Monkeys,  thou  wilt 
discover  four  plants  growing  on  the  summit,  the  radiance  of 
which  illumines  the  ten  regions.  They  are — Mritasamjivani, 
Vishalyakarani,  Suvarnakarani  and  Sandhani,1  herbs  of  rare 
value.  Gather  all  four,  O  Hanuman,  thou  the  son  of  the  Bearer 
of  Fragrance,  and  return  to  aid  the  monkeys  by  reviving  them." 
At  these  words  of  Jambavan,  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta,  felt 
himself  infused  with  tremendous  power,  as  the  ocean  heaves 
with  the  force  of  the  wind.  Standing  on  the  summit  of  the 
high  mountain  which  he  crushed  with  his  weight,  the  valiant 
Hanuman  looked  like  a  second  mountain.  Trodden  down  by 
the  monkey's  feet,  the  mountain  sank,  unable  to  endure  the  load 
that  pressed  so  heavily  upon  it,  and  the  trees  fell  to  the  ground 
and  caught  fire  on  account  of  the  rapid  course  of  the  monkey, 
whilst  the  peaks,  trampled  down  by  him,  were  shattered.  Thus 
crushed,  its  trees,  rocks  and  soil  torn  up,  it  became  impossible 
for  the  monkeys  to  stand  erect  on  that  high  mountain  which  was 
shaking,  and  Lanka,  with  its  great  gateways  destroyed,  its 
dwellings  and  bastions  crumbling,  full  of  terror-stricken  titans, 
appeared  to  be  reeling.    Then  the  son  of  Maruta,  like  unto  a 

*  Mritasamjivani    Reviver  of  the  Dead. 
Vishalyakarani.     Healer  of  wounds  inflicted  by  darts. 
Suvarnakarani.    That  which  heals  the  skin. 
Sandhani.     That  which  produces  a  salve  for  wounds.

mountain,  trod  that  support  of  the  earth  under  foot,  causing 
the  earth  and  sea  to  quake ;  pressing  the  mountain  under  his 
feet,  he  opened  his  mouth  tike  the  fearful  jaws  of  Vadava  and 
began  to  roar  with  all  his  might  in  order  to  strike  terror  into  the 
titans  and,  when  they  heard  that  formidable  clamour,  those 
lions  among  the  titans  in  Lanka  were  paralysed  with  fear. 

Thereafter,  paying  obeisance  to  Samudra,  Maruti,  the  scourge 
of  his  foes,  possessed  of  redoubtable  courage,  for  Raghava's  sake 
prepared  himself  for  the  undertaking. 

Raising  his  tail  which  resembled  a  serpent,  flattening  his  ears 
and  opening  his  mouth  wide,  like  unto  the  entry  to  Vadava, 
he  sprang  into  the  air  with  an  impetuous  bound,  drawing  trees 
with  their  branches,  stones  and  a  rabble  of  monkeys  in  his  wake 
and,  borne  away  by  the  force  of  the  wind  produced  by  the 
movement  of  his  arms  and  thighs,  deprived  of  resistance,  they 
all  fell  into  the  ocean. 

Then  the  son  of  Vayu,  stretching  his  two  arms  that  resembled 
the  coils  of  serpents,  with  a  strength  equal  to  the  enemy  of 
reptiles,1  set  out  in  the  direction  of  that  celestial  peak  of  the 
Lord  of  the  Mountains,  displacing  all  the  cardinal  points  as  it 
were.  And  he  observed  the  ocean  that  rolled  on  and  on  with 
its  garlands  of  waves  and  all  the  creatures  moving  in  its  depths 
while  he  coursed  on  like  the  discus  loosed  by  the  fingers  of 
Vishnu.  Mountains,  flocks  of  birds,  lakes,  rivers,  ponds,  vast 
cities,  crowded  provinces,  passed  under  his  gaze  as  he  journeyed 
on  with  the  swiftness  of  his  sire,  the  Wind-god.  And  the  agile 
and  courageous  Hanuman,  the  rival  of  bis  father  in  valour, 
strove  to  follow  the  orbit  of  the  sun  and,  in  extreme  haste,  the 
foremost  of  monkeys  went  on  with  the  speed  of  the  wind  and  all 
the  quarters  re-echoed  to  the  sound. 

Then  Maruti,  that  great  monkey,  full  of  energy,  remembered 
Jambavan's  words  and  suddenly  Himavat  appeared  with  its 
many  streams,  its  great  number  of  caves  and  waterfalls,  the 
many  kinds  of  trees  that  adorned  it  and  its  peaks  like  a  mass  of 
white  clouds  lovely  to  look  upon.  Thereafter  he  approached 
that  King  of  Mountains  and,  as  he  drew  near  that  Indra  of  high 
mountains  with  its  golden  peaks  of  great  altitude,  Hanuman 
beheld  those  illustrious  and  holy  retreats  of  the  ascetics, 

iGaruda. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

frequented  by  the  foremost  of  the  Gods,  Rishis  and  Siddhas,  and 
he  saw  Brahmakosha,1  Rajataiaya,  Shakralaya,  Rudrashara- 
pramoksha,  Hayanana  and  the  blazing  Brahmashiras  and  he 
recognized  the  servants  of  Vivasvat. 

Thereafter  he  beheld  the  Vahnyalaya  and  the  Vaishravanalaya, 
Suryaprabha  and  the  Suryanibandhana,  Brahmalaya  and  Shanka- 
rakarmukha3  thus  did  he  perceive  the  centre  of  the  earth  ;  and 
Hanuman  also  discovered  the  steep  Mountain  Kailasha  and  the 
Rock  of  Himavat  and  Vrisha,  that  sublime  and  golden  mountain, 
illumined  by  the  radiations  of  all  the  curative  herbs,  the  King 
of  Mountains,  where  all  the  simples  grow.  Astonished  on 
beholding  that  mountain  wreathed  in  phosphorescent  fires,  the 
son  of  Vasava's  messenger  descended  on  that  Lord  of  Hills 
covered  with  medicinal  herbs,  in  order  to  gather  them. 

Then  the  great  monkey,  born  of  Maruta,  covered  a  thousand 
leagues,  ranging  that  mountain  where  those  specifics  grew  on 
that  most  elevated  of  peaks ;  nevertheless,  those  sovereign 
remedies,  knowing  that  Hanuman  had  come  to  gather  them, 
made  themselves  invisible.  Thereupon  that  hero,  not  being 
able  to  see  them,  grew  angry  and,  in  his  ire,  began  to  emit  loud 
cries.  Impatient,  his  glances  inflamed,  he  questioned  that 
mountain,  the  support  of  the  earth,  saying : — 

"  What  impels  thee,  thou  who  art  of  such  strength,  to  show 
thyself  (to  be)  without  pity  for  Raghava  ?  O  King  of  the 
Mountains,  the  hour  having  struck,  overcome  by  the  power  of 
mine  arms,  thou  shalt  see  thyself  shattered  to  pieces  !  " 

Thereupon,  seizing  hold  of  the  crest  with  its  trees,  elephants, 
gold  and  many  kinds  of  ore  that  adorned  it,  with  its  summit  of 

1  Brahmakosha.    The  Place  of  Hiranyagarbha. 

Raj  at  ala  ya.     The  Place  of  the  Silver-navelled   One.     A  mountain   near 

Kailasha. 
Shakralaya.     The  Abode  of  Shakra. 
Rudrashakapramoksha.     The  place  where  Rudra  discharged  the  arrow  at

jagged  peaks  and  sublime  and  radiant  plateaus,  he  broke  it  off 
roughly. 

Having  thus  uprooted  it,  he  flew  into  the  air  to  the  great 
terror  of  the  worlds,  the  Gods  and  their  leaders  and  to  the 
acclamations  of  innumerable  inhabitants  of  the  sky.  Thereafter 
he  flew  away  with  the  speed  of  Garuda,  carrying  that  rocky  peak 
which  shone  like  the  luminous  orb  and  he  too  was  filled  with 
radiance  as  he  followed  the  path  of  the  sun.  Coursing  thus  in 
the  vicinity  of  that  orb,  he  appeared  to  be  its  very  image,  and 
that  peak  spread  a  great  light  over  the  son  of  the  God,  who  is  the 
bearer  of  fragrance,  so  that  it  appeared  as  if  Vishnu  Himself, 
armed  with  his  discus  of  a  thousand  fiery  rays,  were  in  the  sky. 

Then  the  monkeys,  observing  him,  shouted  with  delight  and 
he  also  on  beholding  them,  emitted  tremendous  roars. 

Hearing  those  cries  of  triumph,  the  inhabitants  of  Lanka  set 
up  a  dreadful  clamour  and  Hanuman  alighted  on  a  high  rock  in 
the  midst  of  that  host  of  monkeys. 

Thereafter  he  bowed  to  the  chief  monkeys  and  embraced 
Bibishana. 

Then  the  two  sons  of  that  King  of  Men,  having  inhaled  those 
wonderful  herbs,  were  instantly  healed  of  their  wounds  and  the 
others,  those  valiant  monkeys,  rose  up  in  their  turn  and  all  the 
brave  Flavagas  were  instantly  cured  of  their  wounds  and 
sufferings,  having  inhaled  those  wonderful  herbs  and  those  who 
had  been  slain  returned  to  life  like  sleepers  waking  when  the 
night  is  over. 

From  that  moment  the  monkeys  and  titans  fought  in  Lanka 
itself,  and  thereafter  on  Ravana's  command  and  out  of  perversity, 
all  the  titans  struck  down  in  the  fight  by  the  valiant  monkeys, 
both  wounded  and  dead  were  thrown  into  the  sea. 

Meantime  the  son  of  the  Bearer  of  Fragrance,  Hanuman,  of 
formidable  bounds,  carried  the  peak  of  medicinal  herbs  back  to 
Himavat  and  returned  with  speed  to  rejoin  Rama. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    75 

Lanka  is  set  on  fire  by  the  Monkeys 

At  that  moment,  Sugriva,  the  illustrious  King  of  the  Monkeys, 
addressed  Hanuman  in  words  fraught  with  wisdom,  saying  : — 

"  Now  that  Kumbhakarna  has  been  slain  and  the  youthful 
princes  have  perished,  Ravana  can  no  longer  harm  us  !  There- 
fore let  those  valiant  and  agile  Plavamgamas,  who  are  able  to  do 
so,  hurl  themselves  on  Lanka  with  torches  in  their  hands !  " 

Meanwhile  the  sun  had  withdrawn  behind  the  Astachala 
Mountains  and  at  the  dread  hour  of  night,  the  foremost  of  the 
monkeys  approached  Lanka  with  flaming  torches  and  those 
simian  ranks,  furnished  with  fiery  brands,  rushed  in  on  all  sides 
so  that  the  grim-visaged  titan  sentinels  instantly  fled  away. 
Then  the  monkeys  joyfully  set  fire  to  gates,  pavilions,  highways 
and  byways  and  buildings  of  every  kind,  and  the  dwellings  were 
consumed  by  thousands,  and  the  public  monuments,  as  high  as 
mountains,  toppled  down  and  fell  to  earth ;  all  was  consigned 
to  the  flames !  Sandal  of  great  price,  pearls,  brilliant  jewels, 
diamonds  and  coral,  woollen  cloths,  rich  silks,  carpets  of  many 
kinds  made  of  lambs  wool,  vases  and  weapons  of  gold,  countless 
rare  objects,  harness  and  horse  cloths,  collars  and  girths  for 
elephants,  chariots  with  their  furnishings  and  decorations, 
warrior's  armour,  trappings  for  their  mounts,  swords,  bows  and 
bow-strings,  arrows,  spears,  goads  and  lances,  cloths  of  wool 
and  horsehair,  tiger  skins,  innumerable  perfumes,  palaces 
enriched  with  pearls  and  precious  gems,  with  stores  of  arms  of 
every  kind,  all  were  burnt  to  ashes.  And  the  fire  consumed  all 
the  buildings  with  their  ornamentation  and  devoured  the 
dwellings  of  the  titans  who  inhabited  them. 

Clad  in  armour  encrusted  with  gold,  decorated  with  garlands 
and  other  ornaments,  their  eyes  wild  with  inebriation,  wine 
caused  those  inhabitants  of  Lanka  to  reel  as  they  walked,  whilst 
courtesans  clung  to  their  apparel,  and  they  were  incensed  with 
fury  against  their  foes.    Armed  with  maces,  picks  and  swords, 

220 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

they  were  gorging  themselves  with  meat  and  drink  or  sleeping 
on  sumptuous  beds  with  the  objects  of  their  desire.  Full  of 
terror  they  fled  distracted,  carrying  their  sons  with  them  in  all 
haste,  whilst  their  luxurious  and  splendid  mansions,  which 
combined  every  comfort,  were  consumed  by  fire  in  hundreds 
and  thousands  on  every  side.  Those  golden  buildings  that 
seemed  to  touch  the  skies  constructed  like  moons  and  crescents 
with  their  magnificent  upper  galleries,  their  trellised  windows 
and  terraces  decorated  with  pearls  and  crystal,  re-echoed  to  the 
cries  of  herons,  peacocks  and  the  tinkling  of  ornaments. 

Asleep  in  the  many-storied  residences,  the  lovely  courtesans, 
awakened  by  the  flames  that  scorched  them,  threw  off  the  jewels 
that  impeded  their  flight,  crying : — 'Ah !  Alas ! '  in  piercing  tones. 
Meanwhile  the  palaces  crumbled  in  the  fire  that  consumed 
them,  and  those  flaming  mansions  spread  their  light  afar,  like 
unto  the  summits  of  high  mountains  when  struck  by  Indra's 
thunderbolts,  so  that  it  appeared  as  if  the  Peak  of  Himavat 
itself  were  ablaze. 

The  houses  on  all  sides,  wreathed  in  fire,  resembled  blossoming 
Kimshuka  Trees ;  thus  did  Lanka  appear  that  night !  Elephants 
and  horses  that  had  broken  loose  from  their  keepers  gave  the 
city  an  appearance  of  the  ocean  with  its  maddened  sharks  and 
crocodiles  at  the  time  of  the  end  of  the  world !  Here  a  horse 
was  seen  running  unchecked  or  an  elephant  standing  motionless 
in  terror.  Lanka  in  flames  illumined  the  sea,  the  waters  of 
which,  streaked  with  shadows,  seemed  to  flow  with  blood. 

In  an  instant,  the  monkeys  had  set  fire  to  the  city  and  it  looked 
as  if  the  whole  earth  were  aflame,  as  at  the  dread  destruction  of 
the  world. 

Seeing  the  smoke,  the  women  began  to  shriek  and,  when  the 
flames  reached  them,  their  cries  could  be  heard  at  a  hundred 
leagues  distance.  The  titans  rushed  out  of  the  city,  their  limbs 
covered  with  burns,  whereupon  the  monkeys,  eager  to  come  to 
blows,  fell  upon  them.  Monkeys  and  titans  set  up  such  a 
clamour  that  it  caused  the  ten  regions,  the  ocean  and  the  whole 
earth  to  re-echo. 

Meantime,  healed  of  their  wounds,  the  two  brothers,  Rama 
and  Lakshmana,  intrepid  warriors,  took  up  their  marvellous 
bows  and,  when  Rama  drew  that  excellent  weapon,  the  dreadful 

321 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

thrumming  thereof  struck  terror  in  the  titans  and,  whilst  he 
bent  his  great  bow,  Raghava  shone  in  glory,  as  Bhava  in  his  fury 
when  he  stretches  the  bow  of  the  Vedas.1 

Under  the  shafts  loosed  by  that  warrior,  one  of  the  gates  of 
the  city,  resembling  the  peak  of  Mount  Kailasha,  fell  shattered 
on  the  earth,  and  beholding  Rama's  arrows  falling  on  temples 
and  mansions,  those  Xndras  among  the  titans  made  a  supreme 
effort  and,  while  they  closed  their  ranks,  they  emitted  leonine 
roars  so  that  it  appeared  as  if  the  Night  of  Final  Dissolution  was 
at  hand. 

Then  the  leaders  of  the  monkeys  received  orders  from  the 
magnanimous  Sugriva,  who  said : — 

"  Enter  the  nearest  gate  and  begin  to  fight,  O  Plavagas ! 
If  any  amongst  you  acts  contrary  to  my  orders,  let  him  be 
slain!" 

Thereupon  the  monkey  leaders  bearing  torches  in  their 
hands,  took  up  their  positions  at  the  entrance  of  the  city  and, 
beholding  them,  Ravana,  transported  with  fury  yawned  and 
the  ten  regions  were  thrown  into  confusion  so  that  it  seemed  as 
if  Rudra  were  manifesting  his  wrath.  In  his  rage  he  sent  out 
Kumbha  and  Nikumbha,  both  born  of  Kumbhakarna,  with 
innumerable  titans  and,  at  his  command,  Yupaksha,  Shonitaksha, 
Prajangha  and  Kampana  set  out  with  the  two  sons  of 
Kumbhakarna. 

Then  with  the  roar  of  a  lion,  Ravana  said  to  those  valiant 
warriors : — 

"  Go  forth  immediately,  O  Titans  !  " 

At  his  command,  those  brave  titans,  with  their  shining 
weapons,  left  Lanka  emitting  a  continuous  clamour  and,  with 
the  splendour  of  their  ornaments  and  persons  they  illumined 
the  whole  firmament  as  did  the  monkeys  also  with  their  torches. 

Then  the  light  of  the  moon  and  stars  and  the  brilliance  of  the 
two  armies  irradiated  the  heaven  whilst  the  rays  of  the  moon, 
their  ornaments  and  the  planets  lit  up  the  ranks  of  monkeys 
and  titans  on  all  sides  and  the  light  from  the  half-demolished 
mansions  projected  lurid  flames  over  the  flowing  and  tumultuous 
waves.

With  their  flags  and  pennants,  their  swords  and  excellent 
axes,  their  formidable  cavalry,  chariots  and  elephants,  their 
innumerable  hosts  of  infantry,  their  spears,  maces,  sabres, 
javelins,  darts  and  shining  bows,  that  terrible  army  of  titans  of 
redoubtable  valour  and  ardour  seemed  to  be  furnished  with 
flaming  missiles  and,  amidst  the  clash  of  hundreds  of  gongs, 
their  arms,  encased  in  golden  sheaths,  were  brandishing  axes, 
and  the  javelins  of  the  titans  rang  as  they  struck  with  their 
arrows  and  their  great  bows,  whilst  the  air  was  permeated  with 
the  fragrance  of  their  garlands  and  the  aroma  of  wine. 

Beholding  that  formidable  army  of  titans  that  was  not  to  be 
withstood,  emitting  the  muttering  of  a  great  cloud,  the 
Plavamgamas  were  agitated  and,  whilst  their  terrible  opponents 
advanced  towards  them  they  let  forth  loud  cries. 

Thereafter  the  enemy  forces  hurled  themselves  upon  them 
like  moths  into  a  flame  and,  their  maces  whirling  in  their  fevered 
hands,  emitted  lightning  flashes  which  increased  the  exceeding 
splendour  of  that  host  of  excellent  titans. 

Meanwhile,  as  if  a  prey  to  intoxication,  the  monkeys  rushed 
forward  eager  to  right,  striking  those  rangers  of  the  night  with 
blows  from  trees,  rocks  and  fists,  whilst  they  advanced  on  them 
loosing  their  sharp  arrows.  Then  those  titans  of  immense 
energy,  cut  off  the  heads  of  the  monkeys  who  tore  off  their  ears 
with  their  teeth  and  battered  in  their  skulls  with  their  fists, 
crushing  their  limbs  with  stones  as  they  moved  about.  Other 
rangers  of  the  night,  of  grim  aspect,  struck  the  foremost  of  the 
monkeys  here  and  there  with  their  sharp  swords  and  the  slayer 
was  slain  in  his  turn,  cursing  and  biting  as  they  massacred  each 
other.  Then  one  cried  *  Strike ! '  and  was  struck  in  his  turn, 
whilst  another  called  €  It  is  for  me  to  deal  the  blow '  and  yet 
others  called  in  chorus  *  Why  trouble  thyself?  Stay !  ' 

Amidst  the  stained  missiles,  armour  and  shattered  weapons, 
long  spears  were  thrust  forward  and  blows  from  fists,  maces, 
sabres,  javelins  and  ploughshares  were  given.  Then  the  en- 
counter between  monkeys  and  titans  assumed  terrifying  propor- 
tions and,  in  the  conflict,  the  rangers  of  the  night  slew  their 
enemies  in  tens  of  sevens  and,  in  their  turn,  the  army  of  titans, 
their  raiment  in  disorder,  their  armour  and  standards  shattered, 
were  assaulted  and  hemmed  in  on  all  sides  by  the  monkeys.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    76 

The  Prowess  of  Angada  and  Kumbha  :  Kumbha  is  slain 

At  the  height  of  that  appalling  struggle  in  which  so  many 
valiant  soldiers  perished,  Angada  advanced  on  the  heroic 
Kumbha ;  and  the  impetuous  Kampana,  in  anger,  challenged 
Angada  and,  forestalling  him,  struck  him  a  violent  blow  causing 
him  to  red.  Thereafter  that  warrior,  coming  to  himself, 
hurled  a  rock  on  his  adversary,  who,  crushed  under  the  blow, 
fell  to  the  ground. 

Seeing  Kampana  skin,  Shonitaksha  drove  his  chariot  boldly 
at  the  monkey  and,  in  his  fury,  struck  him  with  his  sharp  and 
fiery  arrows,  tearing  his  flesh ;  then,  like  unto  the  Fire  of  Death, 
he  loosed  innumerable  flaming  Kshuras,  Kshurapras,  Narachas, 
Vatsadantas,  Shilimukhas,  Karnis,  Shalyas  and  Vipathas1  on 
him,  and  that  valiant  and  energetic  son  of  Bali,  his  limbs  pierced, 
in  his  might,  snapped  the  formidable  bow  of  that  titan  and 
shattered  his  chariot  with  its  shafts  also. 

Thereupon  Shonitaksha  instantly  took  up  his  sword  and 
shield  and,  without  hesitation,  sprang  forward  with  an  impetuous 
bound  but  the  courageous  Angada,  receiving  the  violent  impact, 
with  a  shout,  broke  that  weapon  with  his  hand.  Thereafter 
that  lion  among  monkeys,  as  if  following  the  line  of  the  sacred 
thread,  let  the  blade  fall  on  the  titan's  shoulder,  cutting  it  in  two 
and,  raising  his  great  sword,  the  son  of  Bali,  shouting  again  and 
again,  ran  to  the  forefront  of  the  battle  to  seek  out  further 
opponents. 

Now,  in  company  with  Prajangha,  the  courageous  Yupaksha 
drove  his  car  furiously  against  that  valiant  monkey  and,  at  that 
instant,  Shonitaksha,  breathing  heavily,  rushed  on  that  warrior 
of  the  golden  bracelets.1  Full  of  energy,  Prajangha,  the 
intrepid  companion  of  Yupaksha,  hurled  himself  on  the  mighty 
Angada,  mace  in  hand  and,  between  Shonitaksha  and  Prajangha 

1  See  Glossary  of  Weapons. 
1  Angada. 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

the  Prince  of  Monkeys  resembled  the  full  moon  between  two 
Vishakhas.1  Then  Mainda  and  Dvivida  went  to  Angada's  aid 
and  stood  on  guard  near  him,  whilst  the  titans  of  immense 
stature,  their  battalions  drawn  up,  full  of  vigour,  threw  them- 
selves furiously  on  the  monkeys  with  swords,  arrrows  and 
maces  and  the  encounter  between  those  Indras  among  the 
monkeys,  in  the  grip  of  those  bulls  of  titans,  was  desperate, 
causing  the  hair  to  stand  on  end.  In  that  fight,  the  former, 
seizing  trees  and  stones,  discharged  them,  but  Frajangha,  who 
was  exceedingly  powerful,  broke  them  with  his  sword.  Stones 
and  trees  fell  thick  and  fast  on  his  chariot  but  were  all  severed 
by  the  countless  shafts  of  the  mighty  Yupaksha,  while  the  trees 
that,  on  their  side,  were  thrown  by  Dvivida  and  Mainda,  were 
crushed  and  destroyed  by  Shonitaksha,  who  was  full  of  ardour 
and  courage. 

Thereafter  the  infuriated  Prajangha,  brandishing  his  great 
sword  with  which  he  severed  the  limbs  of  his  adversaries,  leapt 
on  Angada  and,  seeing  him  close  beside  him,  that  Indra  among 
the  monkeys,  in  his  great  strength  struck  him  a  violent  blow 
with  an  Ashvakarna  Tree  and,  with  his  fist,  hit  out  at  the  arm 
holding  the  sword  which  fell  at  the  impact.  Beholding  his 
sword  lying  on  the  earth,  like  unto  an  iron  bar,  that  powerful 
titan  raised  his  fist  and,  like  unto  lightning,  brought  it  down  with 
great  force  on  the  brow  of  the  intrepid  Angada,  foremost  among 
the  monkeys,  who  reeled  for  an  instant  but,  having  regained 
his  senses,  that  courageous  son  of  Bali,  boiling  with  rage, 
struck  Prajangha's  head  from  his  shoulders. 

Then  Yupaksha,  seeing  his  paternal  uncle  lying  on  the  field, 
quickly  alighted  from  his  chariot,  his  eyes  full  of  tears  and,  as 
his  quiver  was  empty,  drew  his  sword. 

Beholding  Yupaksha  rushing  towards  him  thus,  Dvivida, 
with  a  mighty  blow,  struck  him  on  the  breast  and,  in  his  ire, 
seized  hold  of  him  with  force.  Perceiving  his  valiant  brother 
made  captive,  the  exceedingly  energetic  Shonitaksha  struck 
Dvivida  on  the  chest,  and  the  blow  caused  the  intrepid  Dvivida 
to  stumble,  but  he  clung  to  the  mace  that  his  rival  sought  once 
more  to  raise  against  him.  Meanwhile  Mainda  joined  Dvivida, 
and  Shonitaksha  and  Yupaksha,  burning  with  courage,  engaged 

1  AsterUms,  (see  Nakshatras.) 

325 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  two  Plavagas  in  a  terrible  struggle.  The  mighty  Dvivida 
tore  the  face  of  Shonitaksha  with  his  nails  and,  dragging  him  to 
the  ground,  crushed  him,  whilst  Mainda,  fired  with  wrath, 
pressed  Yupaksha  in  his  arms  so  that  he  fell  lifeless  on  the  earth. 
Then  the  army  of  those  foremost  among  the  titans,  discouraged 
by  the  death  of  their  leaders,  turned  and  fled  in  order  to  rejoin 
the  sons  of  Kumbhakarna ;  and  Kumbha,  seeing  those  soldiers 
fleeing  in  all  haste,  rallied  them  and,  perceiving  those  valiant 
warriors  to  have  been  cruelly  used  by  the  highly  powerful 
monkeys,  and  their  leaders  being  slain,  Kumbha,  full  of  ardour, 
began  to  execute  difficult  feats  in  the  encounter. 

Taking  up  his  bow,  he,  the  foremost  and  most  skilled  of 
archers,  let  fly  a  series  of  arrows  like  unto  venomous  serpents 
able  to  pierce  the  limbs  and,  with  his  shafts  and  marvellous  bow, 
shining  with  a  great  lustre  he  appeared  like  a  second  Indra 
illumined  by  the  effulgence  of  Airavata !  Thereafter  he  stretched 
that  bow  up  to  his  ear  and  struck  Dvivida  with  a  golden-hafted 
and  plumed  arrow  and,  as  soon  as  it  pierced  that  foremost  of  the 
Plavagas,  who  resembled  the  Trikuta  Mountain,  his  legs  stiffened 
and,  trembling,  he  stumbled  and  fell. 

Mainda,  however,  beholding  his  brother  succumb  in  that 
great  combat,  rushed  towards  his  adversary  with  a  huge  rock 
and  that  hero  hurled  it  at  the  titan,  but  Kumbha  shattered  it  with 
five  whetted  shafts  and,  taking  hold  of  another  dart  with  a  sharp 
point,  resembling  a  poisonous  snake,  he  struck  the  breast  of 
Dvivida's  elder  brother  with  violence. 

Under  the  blow,  Mainda,  the  General  of  the  Monkeys,  his 
chest  torn  open,  fell  unconscious  on  the  earth.  Thereupon  the 
fiery  Angada,  seeing  his  maternal  uncles  overcome  despite  their 
prowess,  hurled  himself  on  Kumbha  who  was  stretching  his  bow 
and,  as  he  advanced,  Kumbha  pierced  him  with  five  whetted 
darts,  then  with  a  further  three,  and  again  with  three  spears, 
as  if  he  were  attacking  an  elephant.  Thus  Angada  was  struck 
by  the  mighty  Kumbha  with  innumerable  shafts  but,  though  his 
limbs  were  pierced  by  a  succession  of  penetrating  darts,  that 
were  flaming  and  adorned  with  gold,  yet  he  remained  immoveable 
and  let  fall  a  shower  of  rocks  and  trees  on  the  head  of  that 
warrior  born  of  Kumbhakarna,  who  cut  off  and  severed  all  the 
weapons  that  the  son  of  Bali  loosed  upon  him. 
326 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Seeing  that  leader  of  monkeys,  Kumbha  cut  off  his  two 
eyelids  with  twin  arrows,  as  one  blinds  an  elephant  with  torches, 
so  that  the  blood  flowed  and  his  eyes  were  veiled ;  thereupon 
Angada,  with  one  hand  protected  his  bloody  lids  and  with  the 
other  seized  hold  of  a  Sala  Tree  that  stood  near  and,  propping 
it  on  his  chest,  he  stripped  that  leafy  tree  of  its  branches,  and, 
having  bent  it  a  little,  discharged  it  in  the  fight  in  the  sight  of  all 
the  titans,  and  that  Sala  Tree,  that  resembled  the  banner  of  Indra, 
appeared  like  unto  Mount  Mandara.  Thereafter  Kumbha  cut 
that  tree  to  pieces  and  pierced  his  adversary  with  seven  pointed 
and  murderous  shafts  so  that  Angada  suddenly  fell  down, 
unconscious. 

Beholding  the  invincible  Angada  stretched  on  the  ground, 
like  unto  the  sea  when  its  waters  recede,  the  leaders  of  the 
monkeys  carried  the  tidings  to  Raghava.  Then  Rama,  hearing 
that  the  son  of  Bali  had  fallen  and  been  overcome  in  the  course 
of  a  desperate  struggle,  issued  his  orders  to  the  simian  leaders 
who  were  led  by  Jambavan.  At  Rama's  command,  those  lions 
among  the  monkeys,  full  of  rage,  their  eyes  red  with  anger, 
rushed  on  Kumbha,  who  was  stretching  his  bow,  and  flew  to  the 
aid  of  Angada. 

Then  Jambavan,  Susbena  and  Vegadarshin,  enraged,  threw 
themselves  on  that  warrior  born  of  Kumbhakarna,  and  seeing 
them  advance,  the  titan  cut  short  the  impetuous  onslaught  of 
those  foremost  of  monkeys  with  a  hail  of  arrows,  as  a  rock 
obstructs  the  course  of  a  torrent  and,  in  the  path  sown  with 
arrows,  the  intrepid  monkeys  were  unable  to  discern  anything, 
nor,  as  the  sea  cannot  overstep  its  shores,  were  they  able  to 
pass. 

Beholding  the  simian  ranks  overwhelmed  by  the  rain  of 
shafts,  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  Sugriva,  placing  his  nephew, 
Angada,  behind  him,  fell  upon  the  son  of  Kumbhakarna  in  the 
fight,  as  an  impetuous  lion  on  an  elephant  who  is  wandering  on 
the  slopes  of  a  mountain,  and  that  powerful  monkey  tore  up 
huge  trees,  Ashvakarnas  and  others  of  varying  fragrance,  in 
great  numbers,  which  he  hurled  at  his  adversary.  Then  the 
illustrious  son  of  Kumbhakarna,  with  his  sharp  arrows,  shattered 
that  irresistible  avalanche  of  trees  that  covered  the  whole  sky 
and  scattered  those  forest  giants  that  shone  like  Shataghnis. 
227 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Beholding  the  rain  of  missiles  dispersed  by  Kumbha,  the 
valiant  Monarch  of  the  Monkeys,  full  of  glory  and  majesty, 
remained  unmoved  and,  suddenly  struck  by  an  arrow,  he  seized 
hold  of  Kumbha's  bow  that  was  equal  to  Indra's  and  broke  it, 
throwing  that  weapon  on  the  ground  with  violence.  Then, 
having  accomplished  that  incredible  feat,  he  angrily  addressed 
Kumbha,  who  resembled  an  elephant  whose  tusks  are  broken, 
and  said : — 

"  O  Elder  Brother  of  Nikumbha,  thy  strength  and  prowess  in 
loosing  thine  arrows  are  admirable  as  are  thy  filial  piety  and 
courage  and  Havana's  also.  O  Thou  who  art  equal  to  Prahlada 
or  Bah'  or  the  Slayer  of  Vritra  or  Kuvera  or  Varuna,  thou  alone 
art  like  unto  thy  mighty  Sire.  Thou  only,  O  Long-armed 
Warrior,  armed  with  thy  mace,  the  slayer  of  thy  foes,  cannot 
be  overcome  by  the  Gods  any  more  than  misfortune  can  over- 
whelm him  who  is  master  of  his  senses  !  Advance,  O  Most 
Intelligent  Prince  and  witness  me  in  action  ! 

"  On  account  of  a  boon,  thy  paternal  uncle  is  able  to  with- 
stand Devas  and  Danavas  and,  full  of  prowess,  Kumbhakarna, 
in  his  turn,  defied  the  Suras  and  Asuras !  With  thy  bow  thou 
art  equal  to  Indra  and  in  valour  Havana's  peer  !  In  the  world 
thou  art  now  the  foremost  of  the  titans  in  strength  and  power  ! 
Let  all  beings  witness  the  mighty  and  prodigious  duel  between 
us  to-day  resembling  the  combat  between  Shakra  and  Shambara! 
By  striking  down  those  valiant  monkeys,  who  were  possessed 
of  extreme  courage,  thou  hast  accomplished  a  feat  without  equal 
and  manifested  thy  skill  in  the  use  of  weapons.  O  Hero,  it 
is  from  fear  of  incurring  reproach  that  I  have  not  slain  thee,  for 
thy  great  exploits  have  wearied  thee;  rest  awhile  therefore, 
reflecting  on  my  prowess  !  " 

Thus  flattered  by  Sugriva  with  fair  words,  the  ardour  of  that 
warrior  was  redoubled,  as  the  sacred  fire  flames  up  when  butter 
is  poured  therein.  Then  Kumbha  seized  Sugriva  in  his  two 
arms,  whereupon,  like  two  elephants  intoxicated  with  ichor, 
those  two,  breathing  heavily  again  and  again,  their  limbs 
interlaced,  crushed  each  other,  wrestling,  and  from  their  mouths 
emitting  flames  mingled  with  smoke.  Under  the  trampling 
of  their  feet,  the  earth  sank  and  the  waters  of  Varuna's  abode, 
overflowed  on  every  side. 

228 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Finally  Sugriva,  having  thrown  Kumbha  down  with  violence, 
cast  him  into  the  salty  waves,  thus  causing  him  to  become 
acquainted  with  the  depths  of  the  ocean.  Nevertheless  Kumbha 
rose  again  and  leapt  on  Sugriva,  with  his  fist  delivering  a  furious 
blow  like  unto  lightning  upon  his  breast,  and  the  armour  of  the 
monkey  was  shattered  and  blood  gushed  forth.  That  violent 
blow  from  the  titan's  fist  struck  against  the  bones  of  his  adversary 
and,  from  the  impact,  a  flame  shot  forth  resembling  the  fire  that 
bursts  from  the  Mountain  Meru  when  struck  by  lightning. 
Thereafter  Sugriva,  that  mighty  lion  among  the  monkeys, 
effulgent  like  the  solar  disc  of  a  thousand  rays,  parrying  the 
thrust,  lifted  up  a  fist  resembling  a  thunderbolt  and  brought 
it  down  with  force  on  his  opponent's  breast.  At  the  impact, 
which  shattered  him,  Kumbha,  bereft  of  his  senses,  sank  like  a 
brazier,  the  brightness  of  which  is  extinguished.  Under  this 
blow  of  the  fist,  the  titan  suddenly  fell  down,  like  unto  the 
Lohitanga  of  brilliant  rays  expelled  from  heaven  by  the  force  of 
destiny.  And  Kumbha  falling,  his  chest  crushed  by  Sugriva, 
resembled  the  flaming  body  of  a  meteor  shooting  from  the  sky  ! 

Thereupon  Kumbha  being  struck  down  in  the  fight  by  that 
Monarch  of  the  Plavamgamas  of  formidable  valour,  the  earth 
with  its  mountains  and  forests  trembled  and  a  great  fear  seized 
the  titans. 


CHAPTER    77 

The  Fight  between  Nikumbha  and  Hanuman 

Nikumbha,  seeing  his  brother  slain  by  Sugriva,  gazed  on  the 
King  of  the  Monkeys  as  if  he  would  consume  him  with  the  fury 
of  his  glance,  and  that  warrior  took  hold  of  his  brilliant  and 
terrible  mace  as  large  as  the  peak  of  the  Mahendra  Mountain, 
like  unto  the  Rod  of  Death,  the  support  of  the  titans,  which  was 
festooned  with  garlands,  plated  with  gold  and  embellished  with 
diamonds  and  coral. 

Brandishing  that  weapon  of  a  splendour  equal  to  Indra's 
standard,  the  fortunate  Nikumbha,  who  was  endowed  with 
redoubtable  courage,  opening  his  mouth  wide,  emitted  bud 

ft  229 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

cries.  With  his  breast  adorned  with  golden  pieces,  his  arms 
encircled  with  bracelets,  his  charming  earrings  and  graceful 
garlands,  his  jewels  and  his  mace,  Nikumbha  shone  like  a  cloud 
shot  with  lightning  and  charged  with  thunder  to  which  the  bow 
of  Indra  is  added.  The  tip  of  his  weapon  shattered  the  con- 
junction of  the  seven  winds  and  that  loud-voiced  hero  glowed 
like  a  smokeless  flame,  whereupon  the  firmament  with  the  City  of 
Vitapavari,  the  most  lovely  palaces  of  the  Gandharvas,  the 
clusters  of  stars  and  planets,  the  moon  and  great  luminaries 
seemed  to  be  spinning  round  with  the  whirling  of  Nikumbha's 
mace !  Unapproachable  in  ardour,  Nikumbha  was  like  unto 
the  Fire  at  the  destruction  of  the  worlds,  his  mace  and  his 
ornaments  the  flames,  his  wrath  the  fuel,  and,  in  their  terror, 
neither  titans  nor  monkeys  dared  to  move. 

Hanuman,  however,  baring  his  breast,  stood  fearlessly  before 
him,  and  that  titan,  with  arms  as  thick  as  iron  bars  which  shone 
like  the  star  of  day,  brought  his  weapon  down  on  the  breast  of 
that  mighty  one  so  that  it  broke  into  a  hundred  pieces  like  a 
meteor  suddenly  exploding  in  space.  But  the  great  monkey 
remained  unmoved  under  the  impact  of  that  weapon  like  a 
mountain  in  an  earthquake.  Thus  assailed  by  his  adversary, 
Hanuman,  the  foremost  of  the  Plavagas,  swinging  his  fist  round 
with  extreme  force  and  lifting  it  up,  with  a  swift  bound  struck 
Nikumbha  a  violent  blow  on  the  chest  so  that  his  armour  was 
shattered  and  biood  shot  forth  like  lightning  from  a  cloud. 

The  shock  caused  Nikumbha  to  stumble  but,  steadying 
himself,  he  seized  hold  of  the  energetic  Hanuman,  whereupon 
a  great  cheering  broke  out  amongst  the  inhabitants  of  Lanka, 
witnessing  that  combat. 

Though  lifted  up  in  this  wise  by  the  titan,  the  mighty 
Hanuman  struck  him  a  violent  blow  with  his  fist  and,  freeing 
himself  from  Nikumbha's  grasp,  leapt  to  the  ground,  thereafter, 
with  a  supreme  effort,  in  his  rage  he  struck  him  down,  crushing 
him  and  then,  leaping  into  the  air,  he  fell  heavily  on  bis  chest 
and  taking  hold  of  his  neck,  pressed  it  with  his  two  hands  while 
he  cried  out,  whereupon  he  tore  off  his  head  which  was  of  an 
appalling  size. 

Amidst  the  shrieks  emitted  by  Nikumbha,  who  had  fallen 
under  the  blows  of  the  son  of  Pavana,  the  armies  of  the  son  of 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Dasaratha  and  the  son  of  that  Indra  of  the  Titans,  both  filled 
with  fury,  entered  into  a  desperate  struggle.  And  Nikumbha 
being  slain,  the  Plavagas  emitted  cries  of  joy  that  re-echoed  in 
all  the  quarters  of  the  horizon  and  the  earth  seemed  to  tremble 
and  the  heavens  crumble,  whilst  the  hosts  of  the  titans  were 
filled  with  terror. 


CHAPTER     78 

Maharaksha  goes  out  to  meet  Rama  and  Lahhmana 

Seeing  Nikumbha  slain  and  Kumbha  also  laid  low,  Ravana,  in 
extreme  wrath,  appeared  like  unto  a  raging  fire,  and  that  Nairrita, 
mad  with  anger  and  grief,  spoke  with  urgency  to  the  son  of 
Rhara,  the  large-eyed  Maharaksha,  saying : — 

"  Go,  O  My  Son,  and,  at  my  command,  strike  down  Raghava 
and  Lakshmana  with  all  the  dwellers  in  the  woods." 

On  this  behest,  the  son  of  Khara,  Maharaksha,  who  was 
proud  of  his  courage,  answered : — 

"  It  is  well !  I  shall  obey  thee !  "  Thereafter,  having  paid 
obeisance  to  Ravana  by  circumambulating  him,  that  valiant 
warrior  emerged  from  his  sumptuous  abode.  Then  Khara's 
son  addressed  the  commander  of  the  army,  who  stood  near, 
saying  :— 

"  Let  my  chariot  be  brought  hither  immediately  and  assemble 
the  troops  at  the  earliest  moment !  " 

On  this,  that  night-ranger  brought  his  chariot  and  assembled 
the  army,  whereupon  Maharaksha,  having  paid  obeisance  to  the 
car  and  circumambulated  it,  caused  it  to  be  driven  forward 
urging  on  his  charioteer  with  the  words :  *  Drive  on  ! '. 

Thereafter  Maharaksha  issued  this  order  to  all  the  titans  : — 

"  Do  ye  precede  me,  O  Soldiers  !  As  for  myself,  the  magnani- 
mous Ravana  has  commanded  me  to  slay  those  two  brothers, 
Rama  and  Lakshmana,  in  combat !  Today  I  shall  lay  them  low 
with  my  whetted  shafts,  O  Night  Rangers,  as  also  the  deer  of  the 
trees  and  Sugriva.  Today,  under  the  blows  of  my  mace,  the 
great  host  of  monkeys  will  be  destroyed  as  dry  wood  by  fire  I  M 
ajs 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Hearing  Maharaksha's  words,  the  rangers  of  the  night, 
furnished  with  all  sons  of  weapons,  full  of  valour,  closed  their 
ranks.  Able  to  change  their  shape  at  will,  ferocious,  endowed 
with  sharp  claws,  their  eyes  inflamed,  emitting  the  roar  of 
elephants,  causing  the  hair  to  stand  on  end,  inspiring  terror, 
those  giants  surrounded  the  huge  son  of  Rhara,  shouting 
joyfully,  shattering  the  vault  of  heaven.  Then  conches  and 
drums  sounded  by  thousands  in  all  the  quarters  whilst  they, 
leaping  and  clapping  their  hands,  caused  a  great  tumult. 

Thereafter  Maharaksha's  charioteer  suddenly  let  the  goad 
drop  from  his  hand,  and  the  standard  fell  to  the  ground,  whilst 
the  horses,  harnessed  to  his  chariot,  slackened  their  pace  and 
stumbled  as  they  advanced,  mournfully  shedding  tears,  and,  as 
the  illustrious  Maharaksha  set  forth,  a  sinister  and  biting  dust 
storm  arose. 

Nevertheless  the  titans,  having  witnessed  those  portents,  set 
out  unheeding  and  full  of  courage  to  meet  Rama  and  Lakshmana 
and  their  hue  was  like  unto  herds  of  elephants  or  buffalo  and  they 
bore  the  marks  of  the  blows  from  maces  and  swords  received  in 
the  forefront  of  battle. 

"  Here  stand  1 1  Here  stand  I ! "  cried  those  seasoned  warriors 
beginning  to  range  to  and  fro  on  the  battlefield. 


CHAPTER    79 

Maharaksha  falls  under  Rama's  Blows 

Seeing  Maharaksha  approach,  the  foremost  among  the  monkeys 
rushed  forward  burning  to  fight.  Thereupon  a  desperate 
struggle  ensued  between  the  rangers  of  the  night  and  the 
Plavagas,  like  unto  that  combat  formerly  waged  between  Devas 
and  Danavas,  causing  the  hair  to  stand  on  end. 

Blows  from  trees  and  swords,  clashes  of  maces  and  iron  bars 
were  exchanged,  whilst  monkeys  and  night-rangers  assailed  each 
other  and  the  titans  created  carnage  among  the  foremost  of  the 
monkeys  with  swords,  maces,  lances,  javelins,  harpoons,  goads 
and  arrows,  nets,  hammers,  sticks  and  other  weapons  with  which 
they  struck  out  on  every  side. 

232 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Overwhelmed  by  a  mass  of  missiles  which  the  son  of  Khara 
hurled  upon  them,  all  the  monkeys,  distracted,  fled  full  of  terror 
and,  seeing  their  enemies  routed,  the  titans  emitted  leonine  roars 
and  triumphant  shouts,  while  the  monkeys  scattered  in  all 
directions.  Then  Rama  covered  the  titans  with  a  hail  of  arrows 
and,  beholding  them  overpowered  in  this  wise,  Maharaksha, 
that  ranger  of  the  night,  consumed  with  the  fire  of  his  wrath, 
challenged  Rama  in  these  words,  saying : — 

"  Stay !  It  is  with  me,  O  Rama,  that  thou  shouldst  measure 
thy  strength !  With  whetted  shafts  loosed  from  my  bow,  I  am 
about  to  relieve  thee  of  thy  life !  Since,  in  the  Forest  of  Dandaka, 
thou  didst  slay  my  sire,  remembering  thine  iniquity,  my  wrath 
has  increased !  O  Wicked  Raghava,  a  violent  fire  consumes  my 
limbs  since  I  failed  to  meet  with  thee  in  that  great  forest !  By 
good  fortune  thou  art  now  before  me ;  as  a  hungry  lion  desires 
to  see  its  prey,  so  did  I  seek  this  encounter !  Soon  shall  my  swift 
arrows  despatch  thee  to  the  region  of  the  dead  where  thou  shalt 
rejoin  the  warriors  thou  hast  slain !  Of  what  use  are  further 
words  ?  O  Rama,  let  all  the  worlds  witness  our  combat ;  let  us 
fight  with  darts,  maces,  fists  or  whatever  weapon  thou 
prefcrest ! " 

Thus  spoke  Maharaksha  and  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  smiling, 
interrupted  that  flow  of  words,  saying : — "  O  Titan,  of  what  use 
is  this  prating  ?  It  is  in  no  wise  worthy  of  thee !  On  the 
battlefield  one  does  not  triumph  by  strength  of  words  but  by 
fighting  !  Fourteen  thousand  titans  and  thy  sire,  Trishiras  and 
Dushana  himself,  fell  under  my  blows  in  the  Dandaka  Forest ! 
Today  vultures,  jackals  and  crows  shall  feed  on  thy  flesh  with 
their  beaks,  nails  and  claws,  O  Wretch  !  " 

Hearing  these  words  of  Raghava's,  Maharaksha  loosed 
innumerable  shafts  on  htm  with  great  violence,  but  Rama,  with 
a  shower  of  darts,  severed  those  golden-hafted  and  richly 
bejewelled  arrows  again  and  again  so  that  they  fell  in  pieces  on 
the  earth.  Thereafter,  as  they  joined  issue,  a  desperate  struggle 
ensued  between  the  son  of  the  demon,  Khara,  and  the  son  of 
Dasaratha,  and  the  clanging  of  their  bow-strings  and  the  clash  of 
their  gauntlets  was  like  the  muttering  of  thunderclouds. 

Then  Devas,  Danavas,  Gandharvas,  Kinneras  and  great 
Serpents  stood  in  the  sky  eager  to  witness  that  prodigious 
*33 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

conflict.  Each  wound  inflicted  on  the  combatants  redoubled 
their  ardour  as  they  exchanged  blow  for  blow,  and  the  countless 
shafts  loosed  by  Rama  were  destroyed  by  the  titan  whilst  those 
of  the  titan  were  severed  by  Rama  again  and  again. 

Innumerable  missiles  covered  all  the  regions  and  space  itself 
and  the  earth  was  heaped  on  every  side  so  that  it  could  not  be 
distinguished.  Finally  the  long-armed  Raghava,  enraged,  broke 
the  bow  of  his  adversary  and  with  eight  Narachas  wounded  his 
charioteer ;  with  his  shafts  he  demolished  the  chariot  and  slew 
the  horses  who  fell  to  the  ground. 

Deprived  of  his  car,  Maharaksha,  that  prowler  of  the  night, 
stood  on  the  ground  and,  armed  with  his  spear,  he  shone  like 
Fire  at  the  dissolution  of  the  worlds ;  and  he  was  irresistible 
with  his  great  lance,  a  gift  from  Shiva,  that  glittered  in  the  air 
like  unto  the  weapon  of  destruction.1 

Beholding  that  great  spear  that  emitted  flames,  the  Gods, 
struck  with  terror  fled  on  all  sides  whilst  that  ranger  of  the  night, 
lifting  it  up,  hurled  it  with  fury  against  the  magnanimous 
Raghava.  As  it  fell  flaming  from  the  hand  of  the  son  of  Khara, 
Raghava,  with  four  arrows,  severed  it  in  its  flight  and,  broken  at 
many  points,  that  spear  with  its  celestial  gilding,  having  been 
destroyed  by  Rama's  shafts,  fell  to  earth  like  a  great  meteor. 

Beholding  that  weapon  shattered  by  Rama  of  imperishable 
exploits,  the  Bhutas  cried  out  in  the  sky : — **  Well  done !  Well 
done !  "and  observing  his  spear  to  be  broken,  Maharaksha,  that, 
ranger  of  the  night,  raising  his  fist,  called  out  to  Kakutstha, 
"Stay!    Stay!" 

Seeing  him  advancing,  Rama,  the  joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu, 
smiling  disdainfully,  took  the  Fire-weapon  from  his  quiver 
whereupon,  struck  by  Kakutstha's  shaft,  the  titan,  his  heart 
transfixed,  fell  down  and  perished. 

Witnessing  the  fall  of  Maharaksha,  all  the  titans,  terrified  of 
Rama's  arrows,  fled  to  Lanka.  Thereafter  the  Gods  rejoiced  at 
the  death  of  that  night  ranger,  born  of  Khara,  who  had  been 
stricken  by  the  violent  blows  of  Dasarathi  and  shattered  like  a 
mountain  struck  by  lightning.

CHAPTER     80 

Indrajita  sets  out  to  fight  once  more 

Hearing  of  the  death  of  Maharaksha,  Ravana,  hitherto  victori- 
ous in  war,  became  a  prey  to  violent  anger,  grinding  his  teeth 
and,  enraged,  he  reflected  on  what  ought  to  be  done.  Having 
considered  the  matter,  in  his  wrath  he  sent  his  son,  Indrajita, 
out  to  fight,  saying  : — 

"  Having  triumphed  over  those  two  powerful  brothers,  Rama 
and  Lakshmana,  return,  O  Hero  !  Visible  or  invisible,  thou  art 
superior  in  every  way.  Wert  thou  not  victorious  in  the  struggle 
with  Indra  of  incomparable  exploits,  therefore  why  shouldst 
thou  not  succeed  with  these  two  mortals  ?  " 

At  this  command  of  the  King  of  the  Titans,  Indrajita,  in 
obedience,  proceeded  to  the  place  of  sacrifice  to  offer  oblations 
to  Pavaka  according  to  the  traditional  rites.  During  the  ceremony 
female  titans  carrying  red  turbans  also  came  there  and  took  part 
in  sacrificing  to  the  fire.  Thereafter  titans  came  up  hurriedly  to 
that  place  where  Ravani  was,  and,  in  that  sacrifice,  weapons  such 
as  Sharapatras,  Bibhitakas,  with  fuel,  red  robes  and  iron  ladles 
were  placed  there,  then,  having  heaped  the  fire  with  Sharapatras 
and  Tomaras,  Indrajita  seized  hold  of  a  living  black  buck  by  the 
neck.  And  that  smokeless  brazier  devoured  the  sacred  grass, 
oblations  and  fuel,  whereupon  many  auspicious  omens,  indicative 
of  victory,  appeared.  With  its  flames,  bright  as  the  moon, 
whirling  in  a  southerly  direction,  the  fire,  having  been  kindled, 
seized  hold  of  the  offerings. 

Thereafter,  having  offered  oblations  to  Agni  and  gratified  the 
Devas,  Danavas  and  Demons,  Indrajita  ascended  his  marvellous 
car  which  he  had  rendered  invisible.  In  his  magnificent  vehicle 
harnessed  to  four  horses,  that  hero,  furnished  with  whetted 
shafts  and  armed  with  his  great  bow,  appeared  resplendent. 
The  chariot  with  its  decorations  of  refined  gold,  carved  with 
figures  of  gazelles,  moons  and  crescents  shone  with  beauty ;  and 
Indrajita  possessed  a  standard  that,  with  its  golden  rings  and 
encrustations  of  emerald,  glowed  like  a  brazier. 
235 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Under  the  protection  of  the  Rod  of  Brahma,  like  unto  the  sun, 
the  mighty  Ravani  was  invincible.  Setting  out  from  the  city, 
having  invoked  Agni  and  acquired  the  power  to  make  himself 
invisible  by  the  aid  of  sacred  formulas  lawful  to  titans,  the 
triumphant  Indrajita  spoke  thus  : — 

"  Today  I  shall  slay  those  two  who  have  passed  their  exile  in 
the  forest  in  vain  and,  in  combat,  win  a  decisive  victory  for  my 
Sire,  Ravana.  Today,  having  destroyed  Rama  and  Lakshmana, 
I  shall  enjoy  the  supreme  felicity  of  ridding  the  earth  of  monkeys!" 
Having  spoken  thus,  he  made  himself  invisible  and  thereafter 
rushed  furiously  into  the  fray,  whither  Ravana  had  despatched 
him.  Effulgent,  with  bow  and  shafts,  that  ardent  adversary 
of  Indra,  beholding  those  two  valiant  heroes  like  unto  a  serpent 
with  three  heads,  who  were  loosing  a  stream  of  arrows  in  the 
midst  of  the  monkeys,  reflected  : — '  These  are  those  two ! '  and 
stretching  his  bow  he  covered  those  warriors  with  a  shower  of 
darts,  as  Parjanya  lets  loose  his  rain.  Standing  in  his  aerial  car, 
invisible  to  the  eye,  he  overwhelmed  Rama  and  Lakshmana 
with  whetted  shafts. 

Enveloped  by  those  swift  darts,  Rama  and  Lakshmana  placed 
celestial  arrows  on  their  bows  and  those  two  valiant  warriors 
covered  the  sky  with  a  rain  of  missiles  as  bright  as  the  sun, 
without  striking  Indrajita. 

Thereupon  that  powerful  titan  filled  the  sky  with  darkness 
and  smoke,  blotting  out  the  cardinal  points  and  shrouding 
himself  in  a  dense  fog;  and,  during  his  airy  flight,  neither  the 
twanging  of  his  bow-string  nor  the  sound  of  the  wheels  nor  the 
clattering  of  the  horses'  hoofs  could  be  heard  nor  could  he 
himself  be  seen. 

In  the  midst  of  that  fearful  darkness,  that  long-armed  warrior 
loosed  a  shower  of  Narachas  so  that  it  appeared  like  an  avalanche 
of  rocks  and,  with  his  golden  shafts,  bestowed  on  him  as  a  boon, 
the  furious  Ravani  wounded  Rama  and  Lakshmana  grievously  in 
every  limb. 

Then  those  two  lions  among  men,  overcome  by  Narachas, 
like  unto  mountains  under  a  deluge,  loosed  their  whetted  and 
golden-hafted  arrows  and  those  darts,  adorned  with  heron's 
plumes,  struck  the  son  of  Ravana  in  the  sky  and  pierced  him  in 
his  course,  whereupon  they  fell  on  the  earth  covered  with  blood. 
236 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Thereafter,  those  two  princes,  with  the  aid  of  innumerable 
shafts,  sought  to  sever  the  mass  of  missiles  in  their  flight  that  burned 
them  cruelly,  and  the  two  sons  of  Dasaratha  aimed  their 
excellent  shafts  in  the  direction  whence  those  whetted  darts  fell. 
Ravani,  however,  a  skilled  driver,  coursing  on  every  side  in  his 
chariot,  struck  the  two  sons  of  Dasaratha  with  swift  arrows  and 
sharp  shafts.  Riddled  by  the  golden-hafted  arrows  that  rained 
upon  them  incessantly,  the  two  sons  of  Dasaratha  appeared  like 
Kimshuka  Trees  in  flower. 

None  could  follow  the  rapidity  of  the  titan's  course ;  none 
catch  a  glimpse  of  him  nor  his  chariot  nor  his  arrows  so  that  he 
resembled  the  sun  obscured  by  heavy  cloud. 

Struck  down,  wounded  and  slain  by  him,  the  monkeys  lay 
stretched  on  the  earth  in  hundreds,  whereupon  Lakshmana, 
enraged,  addressed  his  brother,  saying : — 

"  Shall  I  loose  the  Brahma  Weapon  in  order  to  exterminate 
all  the  titans  ?  "  But  Rama,  who  bore  the  marks  of  royalty, 
answered  him  :-— 

"  Nay,  it  doth  not  behove  thee  to  rid  the  earth  of  titans  !  No 
one  may  strike  him  who  has  withdrawn  from  the  fight,  or  who 
has  sought  protection  or  has  bidden  himself  or  stands  before 
thee  with  joined  palms  or  who  is  fleeing  or  intoxicated !  O 
Long-armed  Hero,  we  will  strive  to  slay  Indrajita  by  employing 
those  exceedingly  fiery  arrows  resembling  serpents.  That 
magician,  that  insignificant  titan  with  his  invisible  chariot  will 
be  overthrown  by  the  monkey  leaders  should  he  reveal  himself. 
Whether  he  penetrate  heaven  or  hell  or  range  the  firmament,  my 
shafts  will  consume  him  wheresoever  he  may  take  refuge  and  he 
will  fall,  deprived  of  life !  " 

Having  spoken  these  significant  words,  that  hero  of  the  House 
of  Raghu,  who  was  surrounded  by  the  Plavagas,  in  his  great 
might,  reflected  on  how  he  should  destroy  that  barbarian,  the 
perpetrator  of  evil  deeds. 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     8  I 

Indrajita's  Stratagem,    Sita's  Apparition 

Indrajita,  having  divined  the  mighty  Raghava's  intention, 
withdrew  from  the  fight  in  order  to  re-enter  the  city.  Thereafter, 
remembering  the  death  of  those  brave  titans,  his  eyes  red  with 
anger,  the  valiant  Ravani  set  forth  once  more,  leaving  by  the 
western  gate  surrounded  by  titans ;  and  the  extremely  energetic 
Indrajita,  the  descendant  of  Poulastya,  that  thorn  in  the  side  of 
the  Gods,  seeing  those  warriors,  the  two  brothers,  Rama  and 
Lakshmana  burning  to  fight,  resorted  to  magic  and  caused  the 
illusory  figure  of  Ska  to  appear  in  the  chariot  encircled  by  a  large 
force  and  he  made  seeming  preparations  to  slay  her. 

For  the  purpose  of  deceiving  the  monkeys,  that  wretch 
conceived  this  design  and,  advancing  to  meet  them,  resolved  to 
slay  Sita  as  it  were.  Then  the  monkeys,  beholding  him  approach- 
ing, enraged,  rushed  upon  him  with  rocks  in  their  hands, 
burning  to  fight.  At  their  head  marched  Hanuman,  that 
elephant  among  monkeys,  armed  with  an  enormous  mountain 
peak.  And  he  beheld  in  the  chariot  of  Indrajita  the  unfortunate 
Sita,  with  a  single  tress,  sorrowful,  her  features  wasted  on 
account  of  fasting ;  and  the  beloved  of  Raghava  wore  only  a 
soiled  garment  nor  had  she  washed  her  countenance  and  the 
limbs  of  that  lovely  woman  were  covered  with  dust  and  mud. 

Seeing  Maithili,  Hanuman  stood  a  moment  as  if  stupefied,  for, 
but  a  little  while  since,  he  had  beheld  the  daughter  of  Janaka 
and,  at  the  sight  of  that  unfortunate  being  standing  sorrowfully 
in  the  car,  under  the  sway  of  that  Indra  of  Titans,  Hanuman 
thought  to  himself '  What  does  this  titan  intend  to  do  ?  *  Having 
reflected  thus,  that  great  monkey,  the  foremost  of  the  Plavagas, 
rushed  forward  to  meet  Ravani. 

Beholding  that  simian  army,  the  son  of  Ravana,  transported 

with  rage,  drew  his  sword  from  its  sheath  and  brandished  it  over 

Sita's  head  in  their  presence,  and  he  struck  that  woman  in 

the  chariot,  who  was  created  by  illusion,  whilst  she  cried  out, 

238 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

"  O  Rama,  O  Rama !  "  Then  Hanumau,  bom  of  Maruta, 
seeing  the  titan  seize  her  by  her  attire,  became  greatly  afflicted 
and  tears  of  grief  fell  from  his  eyes  as  he  beheld  the  cherished 
consort  of  Rama,  who  was  so  divinely  beautiful.  Thereafter,  in 
his  anger,  he  addressed  the  son  of  the  King  of  the  Titans 
harshly,  saying : — 

"  O  Wretch,  it  is  to  thy  destruction  that  thou  hast  laid  hands 
on  her  hair  !  O  Offspring  of  a  family  of  Brahmarishis,  thou  hast 
fallen  into  the  womb  of  a  female  demon.  Cursed  art  thou  for 
thine  infamous  conduct  in  cherishing  such  a  desire  !  Cruel  and 
ruthless  scoundrel,  vile  and  puerile  warrior,  art  thou  not  ashamed 
to  perpetrate  such  an  infamous  deed  ?  O  Pitiless  One,  without 
a  heart,  what  has  Maithili  done,  torn  as  she  is  from  her  home,  her 
kingdom  and  the  arms  of  Rama,  that  thou  shouldst  seek  to  slay 
her  without  mercy  ?  Sita  being  slain,  thou  shalt  undoubtedly 
not  survive  long,  since,  deserving  death  for  such  a  crime,  thou 
hast  fallen  into  my  hands  !  When  thou  hast  yielded  up  thy  life's 
breath,  thy  fate  will  be  the  lowest  hell  to  which  the  slayers  of 
women  descend  and  which  is  eschewed  by  the  most  infamous  of 
evil-doers ! " 

Speaking  thus,  Hanuman,  attended  by  armed  monkeys, 
hurled  himself  in  fury  on  the  son  of  that  Indra  of  Titans  who 
opposed  the  powerful  army  of  monkeys  that  surged  towards  him 
with  his  titans  of  redoubtable  ferocity.  And  he  himself  assailed 
that  simian  host  with  thousands  of  arrows  and  thereafter 
addressed  Hanuman,  that  monkey  leader,  saying : — 

"  I  am  about  to  slay  Vaidehi  before  your  eyes,  who  is  the  cause 
of  Sugriva,  thee  and  Rama,  coming  hither !  She  being  slain,  I 
shall  destroy  Rama,  Lakshmana,  thou  thyself,  O  Monkey,  and 
Sugriva,  as  also  the  vile  Bibishana.  Thou  hast  said  '  One  must 
not  slay  a  woman  ',  O  Plavagama,  but  assuredly  one  is  justified 
in  doing  that  which  will  injure  a  foe !  " 

Speaking  thus,  with  his  sword  furnished  with  a  sharp  blade,  he 
struck  Sita,  that  illusory  phantom,  who  was  sobbing  and,  having 
slain  her,  Indrajita  said  to  Hanuman : — 

"  Behold  how  the  beloved  of  Rama  has  fallen  under  my 
sword !  Vaidehi  is  dead,  thine  arduous  undertaking  has  been  in 
vain!" 

Having  thus  slain  her  with  his  great  sword,  Indrajita,  full  of 
239 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

joy,  standing  in  his  chariot,  began  to  shout  aloud,  and  the  mon- 
keys, ranged  before  him  at  no  great  distance,  heard  him  roaring 
full  throatedly,  stationed  in  his  aerial  citadel. 

Having  slain  the  illusory  Sita,  the  perfidious  Ravani  manifested 
great  delight  and,  beholding  him  fully  satisfied,  the  monkeys,  a 
prey  to  despair,  took  to  flight.

Hearing  that  formidable  clamour  and  beholding  Ravani,  whose 
voice  resembled  Indra's  thunder,  the  monkeys  immediately  fled 
in  all  directions. 

Then  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta,  called  to  those  who,  with  a 
downcast  mien,  sorrowful  and  fearful,  were  fleeing  on  all  sides 
and  said : — 

"  Why  are  you  Seeing  with  a  cheerless  mien  in  all  directions, 
O  Plavamgamas  ?  Where  is  your  courage  ?  Do  not  turn  your 
back  on  the  foe  but  follow  me  into  battle !  " 

At  this  reprimand  from  the  virtuous  son  of  Vayu,  the  monkeys, 
re-assured,  armed  with  rocks  and  trees,  advanced  and,  in  a 
transport  of  fury,  challenged  the  titans.  Thereafter  those  lions 
among  the  monkeys  encircled  Hanuman  who  accompanied  them 
in  the  great  fight  and,  as  the  Consumer  of  Offerings  burns  up 
the  east  with  his  rays,  so  did  Hanuman,  surrounded  on  all  sides 
by  the  foremost  of  monkeys,  consume  the  enemy  host.  Creating 
carnage  among  the  titans,  that  most  powerful  monkey,  attended 
by  the  simian  battalions,  resembled  Yama  on  the  day  of  the  final 
dissolution  and,  smarting  with  grief  and  anger,  Hanuman 
hurled  a  huge  rock  on  Ravani's  chariot. 

Seeing  that  missile  descending,  the  driver,  master  of  his 
horses,  turned  his  car  aside  so  that  neither  Indrajita  nor  the 
charioteer  were  struck  by  that  rock  which  split  the  earth,  burying 
itself  after  a  fruitless  flight. 

Then  those  inhabitants  of  the  woods,  shouting,  rushed  on  the 
enemy  in  their  hundreds  and  those  giants  brandished  trees  and 
240 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

mountain  peaks  so  that  Indrajita  was  covered  by  a  fearful  hail  of 
trees  and  stones  by  those  Plavamgamas  of  redoutable  valour. 
And  they  created  havoc  in  the  ranks  of  the  enemy  causing  a  great 
tumult  and,  under  the  ferocious  blows  of  those  terrible  monkeys, 
the  hideous  rangers  of  the  night  fell,  overwhelmed  by  trees  on 
the  battlefield. 

Beholding  his  forces  thus  roughly  handled  by  the  monkeys, 
Indrajita,  enraged,  surrounded  by  his  divisions,  advanced 
towards  them  loosing  a  quantity  of  arrows  and  that  intrepid 
warrior  struck  down  the  foremost  of  the  monkeys  in  great 
numbers. 

Furnished  with  spears,  rocks,  swords,  harpoons,  picks  and 
maces,  the  monkeys,  on  their  side,  annihilated  his  companions 
in  the  struggle,  and  the  exceedingly  valiant  Hanuman  made  use 
of  huge  trunks  and  branches  of  trees,  stones  and  rocks  to 
exterminate  those  titans  of  terrible  exploits. 

Having  thrown  back  the  enemy  forces,  Hanuman  said  to  his 
troops : — "  We  have  acted  in  order  to  please  Rama  at  the  risk  of 
our  lives  but  she,  for  whom  we  have  fought,  the  daughter  of 
Janaka,  is  dead !  Having  informed  Rama  and  Sugriva  of  this  on 
our  return,  we  will  do  whatever  they  command  ". 

Thus  spoke  that  monkey  general  and  heroically  calling  in  his 
troops,  he  returned  slowly  with  them. 

Meanwhile,  seeing  Hanuman  going  to  rejoin  Raghava,  the 
wicked  Indrajita,  desiring  to  offer  oblations,  went  to  the  sacrificial 
altar  of  Nikumbhila  and,  reaching  that  place,  he  invoked  the 
God  of  Fire,  Pavaka.  Having  entered  the  place  of  sacrifice  at 
the  instance  of  the  titans,  Indrajita  began  to  pour  on  the  libations, 
and  the  fire  blazed  up,  consuming  the  oblations  and  blood,  and 
Agni,  effulgent,  sparkling  and  satisfied,  resembled  the  setting 
sun. 

Thereafter  Indrajita  poured  libations  on  the  earth  for  the 
prosperity  of  the  titans,  according  to  the  rites  in  which  he  was 
well  versed  and,  beholding  this,  the  titans,  instructed  in  what 
was  fitting  and  unfitting,  stood  round  in  great  numbers.

CHAPTER     83 

Lakskmana's  Speech 

Meanwhile  in  that  fight  between  the  titans  and  the  monkeys, 
Raghava,  hearing  the  formidable  tumult,  said  to  Jambavan : — 

'*  O  Friend,  to  judge  by  the  fearful  uproar  and  the  clamour  of 
the  combatants,  Hanuman  is  performing  an  exceedingly  difficult 
feat  at  this  moment.  Go,  attended  by  thine  army,  O  Leader  of 
the  Bears,  and  lend  thine  aid  to  that  Prince  of  Monkeys  who  is 
engaged  in  combat !  " 

"Be  it  so ! "  said  the  King  of  the  Bears,  and  thereafter, 
surrounded  by  his  troops,  he  advanced  to  the  western  gate  to  join 
Hanuman  and  that  Lord  of  the  Bears  beheld  Hanuman  returning 
amidst  his  monkeys  who  had  given  up  the  fight  and  were 
lamenting.  Beholding  the  host  of  bears,  resembling  a  dark  and 
fearful  cloud,  Hanuman  caused  diem  to  halt  and  retrace  then- 
steps.  Then  that  illustrious  warrior,  in  company  with  those 
troops,  speedily  returned  to  seek  out  Rama  and,  full  of  grief, 
addressed  him  saying : — 

"  Whilst  we  were  fighting,  under  our  very  eyes,  Indrajita, 
born  of  Ravana,  slew  Sita  who  was  weeping,  O  Destroyer  of  thy 
Foes  and,  my  mind  being  afflicted  by  this  spectacle,  in  despair  I 
have  come  to  inform  thee  of  what  has  taken  place !  ** 

Hearing  these  tidings,  Raghava,  overcome  with  sorrow,  fell  to 
the  earth  like  a  tree  whose  roots  have  been  severed  and,  beholding 
the  son  of  Raghu,  who  was  like  a  God,  lying  on  the  ground,  the 
monkey  leaders  from  all  sides  rushed  towards  him  as  he  lay 
consumed  with  the  violence  of  his  grief,  resembling  a  fire  that 
has  suddenly  been  ignited ;  and  they  sprinkled  him  with  water 
that  was  fragrant  with  the  scent  of  blue  and  white  lotuses. 

Then  Lakshmana,  full  of  anguish,  pressed  him  in  his  arms  and 
addressed  die  half-conscious  Rama,  in  words  pregnant  with 
reason  and  penetration,  saying : — 

"  O  Thou  who  walkest  in  the  path  of  virtue,  O  My  Noble 
Brother,  though  thou  hast  mastered  thy  senses  yet  righteousness 
242 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

has  not  been  able  to  preserve  thee  from  misfortune  !  I  see  the 
form  of  that  which  is  animate  and  inanimate  but  not  the  form  of 
dharma,  hence  in  mine  opinion,  it  does  not  exist !  Inanimate 
objects  may  be  seen  and  also  those  which  are  animate  but  the 
spiritual  law  is  not  manifest,  else  the  virtuous  such  as  thou 
would  not  suffer  adversity !  If  unrighteousness  brought  evil  in 
its  train,  then  Ravana  would  now  be  in  hell  and  thou,  who  art 
virtuous,  wouldst  not  be  afflicted  by  ill-fortune.  Meanwhile 
calamity  spares  the  titan  in  order  to  strike  thee  down,  which 
proves  the  consequences  of  righteousness  and  unrighteousness  to 
be  reversed  !  If  virtue  produced  good  results  and  unrighteous- 
ness evil  ones,  then  those  (like  Ravana).,  who  have  forsaken 
virtue,  would  suffer  evil  consequences.  Those  who  never  take 
pleasure  in  ill-doing  should  not  be  robbed  of  felicity  since  their 
every  delight  is  in  doing  good ;  those  who  follow  righteousness 
should  pluck  the  fruits  thereof.  Since  prosperity  attends  on 
those  in  whom  unrighteousness  abides  and  those,  who  make 
virtue  their  way  of  life,  are  afflicted,  these  words  (vice  and  virtue) 
have  no  meaning !  O  Raghava,  if  the  evil-doer  perished  through 
his  own  unrighteousness,  unrighteousness  itself  would  perish 
through  its  own  evil  and,  it  being  destroyed,  how  could  it 
destroy  ?  If  it  be  through  the  decree  of  destiny  that  a  man  is 
slain  or  slays  another,  then  it  is  destiny  and  not  the  slayer  who  is 
at  fault.  O  Thou,  Slayer  of  thy  Foes,  since  one  is  unable  to 
discern  the  law  of  dharma  meting  out  retribution  or  behold  its 
form  and  it  is  as  if  it  were  not,  how  is  it  possible  to  attain  the 
highest  by  means  of  dharma  ?  If  dharma  truly  existed,  O  King, 
O  Most  Virtuous  of  Men,  then  thou  wouldst  not  have  suffered 
this  misfortune ;  it  is  therefore  manifest  that  this  law  is  meaning- 
less !  Dharma,  being  weak  and  powerless,  attaches  itself  to  the 
strong  and,  because  of  its  weakness,  rubs  out  any  difference 
between  itself  and  vice,  therefore,  in  mine  opinion,  one  should 
disregard  it.  If  unrighteousness  is  merely  the  result  of  strength, 
then  abandon  it  since  might  is  right.  But  if,  as  some  hold, 
dharma  is  loyalty  to  one's  word,  O  Scourge  of  thy  Foes,  then  thy 
sire  is  guilty  of  adharma  in  the  duplicity  and  cruelty  he  meted 
out  to  thee  without  reason  1  If  one  accepts  the  existence  of 
righteousness,  then  Indra,  the  Bearer  of  the  Thunderbolt,  God 
of  a  Hundred  Sacrifices,  was  not  justified  in  performing  a 

M3 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

sacrifice  after  slaying  the  Ascetic  Vishvarupa.  If  righteousness 
gives  birth  to  unrighteousness,  it  must  perish,  O  Raghava  1 
Men  will  act  accordingly  to  their  whim,  O  Kakutstha.  In  mine 
opinion,  O  beloved  Raghava,  dharma  has  indeed  been  destroyed ; 
thou  hast  severed  its  roots  by  abandoning  thy  kingdom !  like 
streams  from  the  mountains,  all  success  is  brought  to  birth  by 
material  prosperity.  The  man  of  small  intelligence,  without 
resources,  sees  all  his  deeds  come  to  nought  as  trickles  of  water 
drying  up  in  the  hot  season.  Renouncing  wealth  when  one  is 
accustomed  to  the  advantages  in  which  one  is  reared,  is  an  error 
of  judgment  and  is  setting  out  on  the  wrong  path.  He  who  has 
wealth  has  friends  and  kinsfolk ;  he  who  has  wealth  is  verily  a 
man  of  importance ;  he  who  has  wealth  is  a  wise  man.  The 
wealthy  man  is  brave,  the  wealthy  man  is  wise,  the  wealthy  man 
is  powerful,  above  all  the  wealthy  man  is  a  man  of  worth  !  O 
Hero,  I  have  pointed  out  the  disadvantages  that  result  from 
giving  up  one's  good  fortune,  I  see  no  reason  for  thy  determina- 
tion to  abandon  the  crown. 

"  He  who  possesses  a  fortune  finds  virtue,  pleasure  and 
prosperity  to  be  at  his  disposal ;  the  poor  man  who  seeks  wealth, 
cannot  attain  it  and  merely  dreams  of  it.  Wealth  is  the  creator 
of  joy,  pleasure,  pride,  anger,  and  inner  and  outer  control ;  all 
these  come  from  wealth,  O  Foremost  of  Men!  Prosperity 
eludes  virtuous  men  and  those  who  pursue  the  path  of  duty  in 
this  world,  nor  can  it  be  discerned  any  more  than  the  stars  in  a 
stormy  sky !  Whilst,  in  accordance  with  thy  sire's  command, 
thou  didst  live  in  exile,  O  Hero,  a  titan  bore  away  thy  consort  who 
is  dearer  to  thee  than  life  itself. 

"O  Hero,  by  my  valour  I  shall  be  able  to  dissipate  this 
great  grief  that  Indrajira  has  caused  thee  to-day,  O  Raghava, 
arise  therefore,  rise  up,  O  Lion  among  Men,  O  Long-armed 
Warrior,  who  art  fixed  in  thy  vows  !  Dost  thou  not  know  that 
thou  art  the  Self,  the  Highest  'Self? 

"  Here  am  I,  O  Irreproachable  Hero,  at  thy  command  I  The 
tidings  of  the  death  of  the  daughter  of  Janaka  enrages  me  1 
With  my  shafts  I  shall  overwhelm  Lanka,  its  chariots,  horses, 
titans  and  its  king."

CHAPTER     84 

Bibishana  consoles  Rama 

Whilst  Lakshmana,  in  his  fraternal  affection,  was  consoling 
Rama,  Bibishana,  who  had  been  restoring  order  in  the  ranks, 
came  to  that  place. 

Four  warriors,  armed  with  various  weapons,  escorted  him  and 
they  resembled  heaps  of  black  collyrium  and  were  like  unto  the 
leaders  of  elephant  herds.  Then  that  hero  approaching,  beheld 
Raghava  plunged  in  affliction,  as  also  the  monkeys  themselves, 
whose  eyes  were  full  of  tears,  and  he  saw  the  great-souled 
Raghava,  the  joy  of  the  Ikshvaku  Race,  stunned  with  burning 
grief,  whereupon  Bibishana,  his  heart  pierced  with  anguish, 
enquired : — "  How  is  mis  ?  " 

Then  Lakshmana,  seeing  Bibishana,  Sugriva  and  the  monkeys, 
uttered  these  impetuous  words  : — 

"  Indrajita  has  slain  Sita !  Hearing  these  tidings  from 
Hanuman's  lips,  Raghava  has  been  overwhelmed  with  despair, 
O  My  Friend  !  " 

As  Saumitri  was  still  speaking,  Bibishana  interrupted  him  and 
addressed  Rama,  whose  mind  was  agitated,  in  words  fraught  with 
good  sense,  saying : — 

"  O  Indra  among  Men,  that  which  thou  hast  heard  spoken  by 
Hanuman  with  a  sorrowful  mien,  seems  to  me  as  probable  as  the 
drying  up  of  the  sea !  I  am  fully  conversant  with  the  wicked 
Ravana's  design ;  assuredly  he  would  never  permit  Sita  to  be 
ill-treated,  O  Long-armed  Warrior  !  Though  constantly  pressed 
by  me,  who  desired  his  welfare,  to  release  Vaidehi,  he  would 
never  listen  to  me.  Neither  by  persuasion  nor  threats,  concilia- 
tion nor  gifts  nor  by  sowing  dissension,  has  anyone  been  able  to 
behold  Sita,  how  much  less  by  force  of  arms  ?  It  was  in  order 
to  deceive  the  monkeys  that  Indrajita  set  out  to  meet  them  again ; 
this  seeming  daughter  of  Janaka  is  the  effect  of  illusion,  O  Long- 
armed  Warrior. 

"  To-day  Indrajita  is  going  to  the  sacrificial  ground  of 
Nikumbhila   to   offer  an   oblation.     Having  performed  the 

a  245 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

sacrifice,  on  leaving,  the  son  of  Ravana  will  be  invincible  in 
battle  even  ro  the  Gods  led  by  Vasava.  It  is  he,  in  the  role  of 
a  skilled  magician,  who  has  made  use  of  this  illusion  in  order  to 
undermine  the  courage  of  the  monkeys.  Let  us  leave  now  with 
our  forces  ere  he  accomplishes  his  object.  Shake  off  the  distress 
that  has  visited  thee  on  this  account,  O  Lion  among  Men  !  The 
whole  army  is  dispirited  on  beholding  the  grief  that  overwhelms 
thee.  Come,  pluck  up  courage,  rise,  call  up  thy  valour  and 
command  Lakshmana  to  join  with  us  and  the  troops  which  we 
command  i 

"  With  his  whetted  shafts,  that  lion  among  men  will  compel 
Ravani  to  break  off  his  sacrifice,  after  which  he  may  be  slain. 
Thy  brother's  sharp  and  penetrating  arrows,  that  fly  on  wings  and 
resemble  birds  of  prey,  will  drink  his  blood.  O  Long-armed 
Warrior,  let  Lakshmana,  who  is  endowed  with  auspicious  marks, 
bear  down  on  that  titan  in  order  to  destroy  him,  as  Indra  looses 
his  thunderbolt.  O  Best  of  Men,  it  is  not  fitting  to  defer  the 
slaying  of  a  foe  j  now  suffer  Lakshmana  ro  fall  on  thine  adversary 
speedily  in  order  to  slay  him,  as  Mahadeva  looses  his  thunderbolt 
on  the  enemies  of  the  Gods  in  order  to  exterminate  them." 


CHAPTER    85 

Lakshmana  goes  to  the  Nikumbhila  Grove  to  fight  Indrajita 

Thus  did  the  titan  speak,  but  Raghava,  who  was  overwhelmed 
with  grief,  did  not  fully  comprehend  what  was  said  to  him. 
Thereafter,  having  regained  his  strength,  Rama,  the  Conqueror 
of  Hostile  Citadels,  answered  Bibishana,  who  was  seated  at  bis 
side,  saying : — 

"  O  Bibishana,  Prince  of  the  Nairritas,  I  desire  to  hear  once 
more  what  thou  hast  said  to  me ;  do  thou  repeat  what  I  long  to 
know." 

Hearing  these  words  of  Raghava,  Bibishana,  skilled  in 
discourse,  repeated  that  which  he  had  already  told  him,  saying: — 

"  The  behests  thou  didst  lay  upon  me,  O  Long-armed 
Warrior,  regarding  the  disposal  of  the  forces,  have  been  carried 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

out  scrupulously ;  the  divisions  of  the  army  are  drawn  up  on  all 
sides  and  the  leaders  have  each  had  their  posts  allotted  to  them. 
O  Mighty  Lord,  now  hear  what  I  have  to  impart  further. 

"  O  Prince,  beholding  thee  afflicted,  we  are  discouraged ; 
abandon  thy  distress,  that  grief  which  conduces  to  the  joy  of  the 
foe  afar  off !  Take  courage,  O  Hero,  and  destroy  the  rangers  of 
the  night !  May  felicity  be  thine,  since  thou  art  to  be  re-united 
with  Sita !  O  Joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  listen  to  my  sage 
counsel !  Let  Saurnitri  set  out  bravely  at  the  head  of  a  consider- 
able force  and  converge  on  the  Nikumbhila  Grove,  in  order  to 
slay  Ravani  in  combat  by  the  aid  of  arrows,  resembling  venomous 
snakes,  loosed  from  bis  bow ! 

"  That  warrior,1  on  account  of  his  asceticism  received  a 
marvellous  boon,  the  Brahmashira  Weapon,  from  Swyambhu  and 
also  steeds  that  course  at  bis  will ;  he  has  undoubtedly  reached 
the  Nikumbhila  Grove  with  his  forces !  If  he  succeeds  in 
carrying  through  the  sacrifice,  know  that  we  are  lost ! 

"'The  foe  who  strikes  thee  ere  thou  hast  reached  the 
Nikumbhila  Grove  and  ignited  the  fire,  armed  as  thou  art,  will 
bring  about  thy  death,  O  Enemy  of  Indra! '  Such  were  the  words 
pronounced  by  the  Lord  of  the  World  and  thus  was  the  end  of 
that  crafty  titan  ordained  !  O  Rama,  send  thy  powerful  brother 
to  slay  Indrajita  and,  he  being  slain,  Ravana  with  his  friends  is 
also  slain! " 

Bibishana  having  spoken  thus,  Rama  answered  him  saying : — 

*'  O  Thou,  whose  prowess  is  truth,  I  know  the  magic  power  of 
that  barbarian ;  his  knowledge  of  the  Brahma  Weapon  endows 
that  skilful  and  great  magician  with  immense  power  so  that  he  is 
able  to  deprive  the  Gods  and  Varum  himself  of  consciousness  in 
combat !  While  he  ranges  the  sky  in  his  chariot,  O  Illustrious 
Prince,  one  is  no  more  able  to  follow  bis  course  than  that  of  the 
sun  in  the  midst  of  heavy  cloud  !  " 

Then  Raghava,  who  was  conversant  with  the  magic  power  of 
that  crafty  foe,  said  to  Lakshmana  who  shone  with  effulgence : — 

"  Go  with  the  entire  army  of  the  Lord  of  the  Monkeys  with 
its  generals  and  Hanuman  at  their  head,  O  Lakshmana ;  take 
the  army  of  the  bears  with  their  leader  Jambavan,  and  destroy 
the  titan  possessed  of  the  power  of  magic.  This  magnanimous 

1  Indrajita. 

*47 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

night-ranger1  will  follow  thee  with  his  ministers  in  order  that 
thou  mayest  fall  upon  that  master  of  illusion." 

Hearing  these  words  of  Raghava,  Lakshmana  of  redoubtable 
courage,  who  was  accompanied  by  Bibishana,  took  up  his  rare 
bow,  the  foremost  of  all,  and  donning  his  mail,  furnished  with  a 
sword  and  arrows,  and  full  of  joy,  addressed  him  thus : — 

"  To-day  the  arrows  loosed  from  my  bow,  having  pierced 
Ravani,  will  lay  Lanka  waste  as  herons  ravage  a  lotus  pool !  This 
very  day  the  shafts  speeding  from  my  bow  will  pierce  the  body  of 
that  barbarian  !  " 

Having  spoken  thus  to  his  brother,  the  illustrious  Lakshmana, 
eager  to  slay  Ravani,  departed  with  all  speed  and,  having  paid 
obeisance  to  the  feet  of  his  elder  brother  and  circumambulated 
him,  he  set  out  for  the  Nikumbhila  Grove,  the  place  of  sacrifice, 
where  Ravani  was  to  be  found.  Followed  by  Bibishana,  Prince 
Lakshmana,  burning  with  courage,  with  the  good  wishes  of  his 
brother,  hastened  away.  Then  Hanuman,  at  the  head  of  count- 
less monkeys  and  Bibishana  wirh  his  counsellors  speedily 
followed  in  his  wake. 

Whilst  the  great  hosts  of  monkeys  threw  themselves  in  his 
train,  Lakshmana  beheld  the  forces  of  the  King  of  the  Bears 
stationed  in  the  way.  Thereafter  Sumitra's  son,  the  joy  of  his 
friends,  having  already  covered  a  great  distance,  observed  the 
army  of  the  King  of  the  Titans  ranged  for  battle  and,  bow  in  hand, 
that  conqueror  of  his  foes,  the  joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  coming 
upon  that  skilful  magician,  prepared  to  enter  into  combat  with 
him  in  conformity  with  Brahma's  ordinance,  and  that  prince, 
who  was  full  of  ardour,  was  accompanied  by  Bibishana,  the 
valiant  Angada  and  also  the  son  of  Anila. 

Thereafter  Lakshmana,  as  one  entering  into  darkness,  pene- 
trated into  the  ranks  of  the  countless  enemy  host  that  was 
exceedingly  formidable,  blazing  with  its  glittering  weapons  and 
shaded  by  its  dense  rows  of  mighty  chariots  with  their  standards.

Indrajita  breaks  off  Ms  Sacrifice  to  fight  ttnth  Lakshmana 

As  these  events  were  taking  place,  the  younger  brother  of 
Ravana1  gave  the  following  counsel  to  Lakshmana,  which  was 
advantageous  to  his  undertaking  but  detrimental  to  bis  foes, 
saying : — 

"Armed  with  rocks,  throw  thyself  with  thy  monkeys  on  the 
army  of  the  titan  which  is  now  visible  and  resembles  a  dark 
cloud.  Seek  to  overthrow  them,  O  Lakshmana,  for  the  son  of 
that  Indra  of  the  Titans  will  become  visible  the  instant  die  ranks 
are  broken.  With  thine  arrows,  that  equal  Indra's  thunderbolt, 
assail  the  enemy ;  enter  into  the  fray  with  all  speed  ere  the 
sacrifice  be  completed.  O  Warrior,  triumph  over  that  perverse 
but  skilled  magician,  the  wicked  Ravani  of  ruthless  exploits,  the 
terror  of  the  worlds  !  " 

At  these  words  of  Bibishana,  Lakshmana,  endowed  with 
auspicious  marks,  let  loose  a  rain  of  shafts  on  the  son  of  the  Lord 
of  the  Titans.  Thereafter  the  bears  and  monkeys  in  a  body, 
arming  themselves  with  huge  trees,  rushed  on  the  army  of  the 
titans  which  was  drawn  up  in  battle  array  and  which,  with  sharp 
darts,  swords,  picks  and  spears  hurled  itself  on  the  simian 
battalions  eager  to  overcome  them. 

Thereupon  a  desperate  struggle  ensued  between  monkeys  and 
titans  and  the  city  re-echoed  with  the  mighty  tumult.  Missiles 
of  every  kind,  whetted  darts,  trees  and  mountain  peaks  sped 
through  the  air  in  dreadful  wise  so  that  the  sky  was  obscured 
and  innumerable  titans,  possessed  of  monstrous  arms  and  faces, 
hurled  their  weapons  on  the  foremost  of  the  monkeys,  creating 
extreme  terror  amongst  them,  whilst,  from  their  side,  the 
monkeys  struck  the  titans  with  whole  trees  and  crags,  crushing 
them  in  the  struggle.  And  the  foremost  of  the  bears  and 
monkeys,  of  immense  stature,  created  great  terror  among  the 
titans  with  whom  they  fought.  Learning  that  his  army,  over- 
whelmed by  their  foes,  was  losing  ground,  the  invincible 

Bibishana. 

*49 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Indrajita  arose,  the  sacrificial  rites  as  yet  uncompleted  and,  leaving 
the  Nikumbhila  Grove,  that  was  darkened  by  trees,  Ravani, 
enraged,  ascended  his  chariot  that  stood  ready  harnessed  and 
fully  equipped ;  with  his  bow  and  arrows,  he  was  formidable 
and  resembled  a  heap  of  black  collyrium,  terrifying  to  behold 
with  his  reddened  eyes,  like  unto  Mrityu  the  Destroyer. 

Beholding  him  standing  in  his  chariot  and  the  titan  host 
ranged  round  about  him,  rushing  to  attack  Lakshmana  with 
fury,  Hanuman,  the  scourge  of  his  foes,  who  resembled  a 
mountain,  uprooted  a  huge  tree,  difficult  to  wield  and,  like  unto 
Kala's  consuming  fire,  that  monkey,  with  repeated  blows, 
struck  down  the  enemy  on  the  battlefield  where  they  lay  insensible. 

Seeing  the  son  of  Pavana  creating  confusion  in  the  ranks, 
thousands  of  titans  attacked  him  with  spears,  those  bearing 
lances  with  lances,  those  with  swords  with  blows  of  their  swords 
and  those  with  harpoons  with  blows  of  harpoons.  Iron  bars, 
maces,  sticks  in  their  hundreds,  Shataghnis,1  iron  hammers, 
terrible  axes,  Bhindipalas,  blows  from  their  fists  like  unto 
lightning,  slaps  sounding  like  thunder,  were  all  delivered  at 
Hanuman,  who  like  unto  a  mountain  in  stature,  in  his  rage, 
created  a  terrible  carnage. 

Then  Indrajita  beheld  the  foremost  of  the  monkeys,  the 
intrepid  son  of  Pavana,  like  unto  a  rock,  destroying  his  adver- 
saries and,  addressing  his  charioteer,  be  said : — 

"  Drive  towards  that  monkey ;  he  will  certainly  destroy  all 
the  titans  if  he  is  suffered  to  do  so !  " 

At  this  command,  the  driver  set  his  course  at  Maruti  and 
drove  the  invincible  Indrajita,  who  was  standing  in  the  chariot, 
upon  him.  Then  that  redoubtable  titan,  drawing  near,  let  fall 
arrows,  blows  from  his  sword,  harpoons,  spears  and  axes  on  the 
head  of  that  monkey,  so  that  those  formidable  missiles  that  fell 
upon  him  threw  Maruti  into  a  transport  of  rage  and  he  said : — 

"  O  Perverse  Son  of  Ravana,  if  thou  hast  any  claim  to  valour, 
then  fight ;  with  thy  two  arms  strive  with  me !  O  Insensate 
One,  if  thou  dost  withstand  my  might,  thou  shall  be  accounted 
as  the  foremost  of  the  titans !  " 

Then  Bibishana  pointed  out  the  son  of  Ravana,  to  Lakshmana, 
as  he,  with  bow  upraised,  sought  to  slay  Hanuman,  and  said  :— 

1  See  Glossary  of  Weapons.

YUDDHA    KANDA 

"  The  Conqueror  of  Vasava,  the  son  of  Ravana,  standing  in 
his  car,  is  about  to  slay  Hanuman !  O  Saumitri,  do  thou  slay 
Ravani  with  thy  formidable  arrows  of  incomparable  workman- 
ship, the  destroyers  of  their  foes,  that  put  an  end  to  their  lives  !  " 

Hearing  Bibishana's  words,  that  magnanimous  one,  a  veritable 
Bibishana,1  looked  on  Indrajita  of  dreadful  prowess,  who, 
standing  in  his  chariot,  was  invincible  and  resembled  a  mountain. 


CHAPTER     87 

Indrajita  and  Bibishana  denounce  each  other 

Having  spoken  thus,  Bibishana,  delighted,  taking  Saumitri,  who 
bore  his  bow  in  his  hand,  hastened  away.  Proceeding  some 
distance,  they  entered  a  great  wood  where  Bibishana  pointed  out 
Indrajita's  place  of  sacrifice  to  Lakshmana  and  the  illustrious 
brother  of  Havana  showed  Saumitri  a  huge  Nyagrodha  Tree  of 
fearful  aspect,  resembling  a  dark  cloud,  and  said : — 

"  It  is  here  that  the  powerful  son  of  Ravana  offers  up  his 
victims  and  thereafter  enters  into  combat.  Becoming  invisible 
to  all  creatures,  the  titan  overthrows  his  enemies  in  the  fight, 
paralysing  them  with  his  excellent  shafts.  Do  thou  pierce  the 
valiant  son  of  Ravana,  his  chariot,  steeds  and  charioteer  with  thy 
flaming  darts  ere  he  reaches  the  Nyagrodha  Tree  !  " 

"  Be  it  so  !  "  replied  the  mighry  Saumitri,  the  delight  of  his 
friends  and,  taking  his  stand,  he  drew  his  marvellous  bow. 

Thereafter  Indrajita,  the  powerful  son  of  Ravana  appeared 
before  them  in  his  chariot,  that  shone  like  fire,  clad  in  armour 
with  his  sword  and  banner.  Burning  with  ardour,  Lakshmana 
challenged  that  invincible  descendant  of  Poulasty  a,  saying : — 

"  I  challenge  thee  to  combat !    Let  it  be  in  fair  fight !  " 

Thus  accosted,  the  brave  and  exceedingly  energetic  Indrajita, 
observing  Bibishana,  overwhelmed  him  with  reproaches, 
saying: — 

"  O  Thou,  born  and  bred  in  this  race,  the  brother  of  my  sire, 
why  dost  thou  seek  to  harm  his  son,  0  My  Paternal  Uncle,  O 

1  Bibishana — One  who  inspires  terror. 

251 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Titan?  For  thee,  O  Wretch,  there  is  neither  tradition,  brotherly 
feeling  nor  a  sense  of  duty !  O  Impious  One,  Thou  art  to  be 
pitied  !  O  Perverse  Being,  thou  art  the  object  of  reproach  to  the 
virtuous,  thou  who  didst  abandon  thine  own  kind  in  order  to 
seek  service  with  the  enemy.  Is  it  not  a  want  of  intelligence  in 
thee,  that  thou  dost  not  discern  the  great  difference  between 
living  with  one's  kindred  and  seeking  a  miserable  refuge  with 
strangers  ?  Ever  if  a  stranger  be  endowed  with  every  quality 
and  a  relation  bereft  of  them  all,  yet  the  kinsman,  though  wanting 
in  all  merit,  is  to  be  preferred ;  a  stranger  is  always  a  stranger ! 
He  who  renounces  his  own  kind  to  follow  another  will  perish 
under  the  blows  of  the  enemy  after  his  own  kinsfolk  have  been 
destroyed.  Thou  alone  art  capable  of  such  ruthlessness  and  so 
relentless  an  attitude  to  thy  kind,  O  Ranger  of  the  Night,  O 
Younger  Brother  of  Ravana !  " 
Thus  addressed  by  his  brother's  son,  Bibishana  answered  : — 
"Art  thou  ignorant  of  my  character  that  thou  dost  reproach 
me  thus,  O  Titan  ?  O  Perverse  Prince,  do  not  insult  me  but 
treat  me  with  respect.  Albeit  I  have  been  born  in  the  race  of 
titans,  I  possess  those  principles  which  appertain  to  men,  my 
nature  is  not  that  of  the  demons !  Nay,  I  do  not  delight  in 
cruelty  nor  does  injustice  find  favour  with  me  but,  even  if  his 
character  be  dissimilar,  how  can  a  brother  banish  his  own  brother? 
The  one,  who  rejects  him  who  renounces  his  duty  and  is  bent  on 
evil-doing,  is  assured  of  good  fortune,  as  one  who  shakes  off  a 
snake  from  his  hand.  One  is  told  to  fly  that  perverse  wretch  who 
habitually  purloins  his  neighbour's  goods  and  has  intercourse 
with  other's  wives,  as  one  would  flee  from  a  burning  dwelling. 

"  To  take  possession  of  another's  property  or  to  look  with 
desire  on  his  neighbour's  wife  or  to  distrust  one's  friends  are  the 
three  faults  that  lead  to  destruction  !  The  ruthless  slaughter  of 
the  great  sages,  the  war  on  the  Gods,  arrogance,  anger,  hate  and 
self-will  are  the  defects  of  my  brother,  who  is  destroying  himself 
and  his  empire,  obscuring  his  good  qualities  as  clouds  veil  the 
mountains.  It  is  on  account  of  his  vices  that  I  abandoned  my 
brother,  whose  son  thou  art.  Thou,  thy  father  and  Lanka  are 
doomed  !  O  Titan,  Thou  art  a  mere  boy  possessed  of  an  over- 
weening pride  and  art  ill-mannered  !  Say  what  thou  wilt  to  me, 
thou  art  caught  in  the  noose  of  death !  Thou  shalt  suffer  the 
»5* 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

penalty  thou  hast  merited  for  the  harsh  reproaches  thou  hast 
made  to  me  this  day !  From  henceforth  thou  shalt  not  be  able 
to  approach  the  Nyagrodha  Tree,  O  Vilest  of  the  Titans  !  Having 
outraged  Kakutstha,  thou  canst  not  survive!  Enter  into 
combat  with  this  God  among  men !  Fall  on  the  field  of  battle 
and  go  to  the  abode  of  Yama  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Gods ! 
Display  thy  prowess,  exhaust  thy  weapons  and  missiles  but  if 
thou  approachest  within  the  range  of  Lakshmana's  shafts,  thou 
and  thine  army  shalt  not  return  alive !  " 


chapter   88 

The  Combat  between  Ldkshmana  and  Indrajita 

Hearing  Bibishana's  words,  Indrajita,  seething  with  anger, 
answered  him  with  fresh  invectives  and  advanced  upon  him  in 
fury.  Standing  in  his  richly  decorated  chariot,  that  was  yoked 
to  black  steeds,  his  weapons  and  sword  upraised,  bearing  his 
mighty,  pliant  and  terrible  bow  and  his  arrows  that  were  fatal 
to  the  foe,  he  resembled  the  Destroyer,  Death  Himself. 

Then  Lakshmana  in  all  bis  splendour  appeared  before  that 
mighty  archer  standing  in  his  car,  decked  with  ornaments,  the 
slayer  of  his  foes,  the  valiant  son  of  Ravana,  and,  transported 
with  fury,  Indrajita  addressed  Saumitri,  who  was  seated  on 
Hanuman's  back  and  resembled  the  rising  sun,  and  Bibishana 
also  and  the  foremost  of  the  monkeys,  saying : — 

"  Do  ye  all  behold  my  prowess  !  In  an  instant,  a  rain  of 
arrows  speeding  from  mine  irresistible  bow  will  tall  upon  you  in 
the  fight  like  unto  a  shower  of  rain  from  the  sky !  Soon  the 
shafts  loosed  from  my  great  bow  will  scatter  your  limbs  as  the 
wind  a  heap  of  cotton !  Pierced  by  my  sharp  darts,  spears, 
lances,  daggers  and  other  weapons,  this  day  I  shall  send  you  all 
to  the  abode  of  Yama  !  When,  roaring  like  a  thundercloud,  I 
scatter  the  waves  of  mine  arrows  with  a  steady  hand  in  the  fray, 
who  can  stand  before  me  ? 

"  Formerly  in  a  night  engagement,  with  my  darts  that  are 
equal  to  thunderbolts,  I  overthrew  you  both,  leaving  you 
353 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

unconscious  with  your  escort ;  hast  thou  forgotten  it  ?    Since 

thou  desirest  to  measure  thy  strength  with  mine,  I  who  in  my 
fury  resemble  a  venomous  reptile,  I  deem  thou  art  anxious  to 
enter  the  region  of  death !  " 

Hearing  the  taunts  of  Ravani,  that  Indra  among  the  Titans, 
the  son  of  Raghu  replied  indignantly : — 

"  It  is  not  easy  to  succeed  in  those  undertakings  of  which  thou 
dost  boast  and,  in  fact,  he  who  accomplishes  his  end,  alone  is 
skilful !  O  Thou  whose  situation  is  desperate,  thou  deemest  to 
have  attained  thy  purpose  in  this  enterprise  which  is  untenable 
from  every  aspect,  merely  by  saying  I  have  accomplished  mine 
end  !  O  Insensate  One,  rendering  thyself  invisible  on  the  field 
of  battle  is  the  procedure  of  a  rogue ;  honest  men  do  not  practice 
it !  Since  I  am  within  the  range  of  thy  shafts,  O  Titan,  manifest 
thy  prowess ;  of  what  use  is  this  bragging  ?  " 

Thus  addressed,  Indrajita  who  was  ever  victorious  in  combat, 
stretched  his  dread  bow  and  with  a  powerful  arm  let  fly  his 
whetted  shafts  on  his  adversary.  Discharged  by  him,  those 
swift  arrows  resembling  venomous  snakes,  struck  Lakshmana 
hissing  like  serpents,  and  the  impetuous  son  of  Ravana,  Indrajita, 
with  those  arrows  of  extreme  velocity,  overwhelmed  Saumitri, 
who  was  endowed  with  auspicious  marks,  whereupon  the 
fortunate  Lakshmana,  his  limbs  pierced  by  those  darts,  covered 
in  blood,  shone  like  a  smokeless  flame  ! 

Meanwhile  Indrajita,  contemplating  his  feat,  advanced, 
emitting  an  exceedingly  loud  cry  and  said :— - 

"  O  Saumitri,  the  feathered  shafts  loosed  upon  thee  from  my 
bow  will  rob  thee  of  thy  life,  for  their  impact  is  mortal !  This 
very  day,  O  Lakshmana,  bands  of  jackals,  eagles  and  vultures  will 
descend  upon  thee  when  thou  hast  fallen  unconscious  under  my 
blows !  Rama  of  perverse  soul  will  see  thee,  his  devoted  brother, 
struck  down  by  mine  arm,  thine  armour  shattered,  thy  bow  in 
pieces,  thy  head  severed,  thou  who  art  a  warrior  by  birth  only !  " 

To  these  insolent  words  of  Ravana's  son,  the  sagacious 
Lakshmana  replied  in  measured  and  judicious  terms,  saying : — 

"  Cease  from  boasting,  O  Wretched  Titan  of  crooked  ways, 
what  purpose  is  served  by  vain  speech  ?  Demonstrate  thy  valour 
in  action ;  thou  dost  vaunt  thine  exploits  ere  thou  hast  accom- 
plished them  !  To  what  end,  O  Titan  ?  Act  in  such  a  way  that 
254 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

I  may  believe  in  thine  utterances  !  Mark  how,  without  addres- 
sing a  single  word  of  contempt  or  provocation  to  thee  and  without 
bragging,  I  shall  slay  thee,  O  Last  of  Warriors  !  " 

Thus  speaking,  Lakshmama,  with  five  Narachas  loosed  with 
great  force  from  his  bow,  which  he  stretched  up  to  his  ear, 
struck  the  titan  full  in  the  breast  and  those  feathered  shafts  of 
swift  flight,  resembling  fiery  serpents,  shone  in  the  breast  of  the 
Nairrita  like  the  rays  of  the  sun. 

Struck  by  those  darts,  the  son  of  Ravana,  enraged,  in  his  turn, 
pierced  Lakshmana  with  three  well-aimed  arrows.  Thereupon 
an  appalling  and  fearful  exchange  of  blows  ensued  between  those 
lions  among  men  and  titans,  who  sought  to  triumph  over  each 
other.  Valiant  and  endowed  with  strength,  both  courageous  by 
nature,  each  found  it  hard  to  overcome  the  other,  neither  having 
his  equal  in  energy  and  prowess.  Resembling  two  planets 
coursing  through  the  heavens,  those  two  heroes  strove,  so  that 
they  seemed  like  those  two  invincible  warriors,  Bala  and  Vritra, 
struggling  proudly  like  two  lions,  standing  immoveable  as  they 
showered  innumerable  darts  on  each  other,  and  that  King  of 
Men  and  Prince  of  the  Titans  fought  on  with  extreme  ardour. 


chapter    89 

Lakshmana  and  Indrajita  continue  to  fight 

Meanwhile  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  slayer  of  his  foes,  arming 
himself  with  arrows,  loosed  them  in  fury  on  that  Indra  of  Titans 
and  at  that  twanging  of  his  bow-string,  the  titan  leader,  his 
countenance  ashen,  fixed  his  gaze  on  Lakshmana. 

Bibishana  beholding  the  blenched  features  of  the  son  of 
Ravana,  said  to  Saumitri  who  was  engaged  in  combat : — 

"  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  I  behold  inauspicious  signs  round 
Ravana's  son,  hasten  therefore  for  he  is  assuredly  nearing  his 
end ! " 

Thereupon    Saumitri,    selecting   some    arrows    resembling 

venomous  snakes,  let  fly  those  barbed  shafts  like  unto  exceedingly 

poisonous  serpents  on  Indrajita  and  he,  struck  by  those  missiles 

like  unto  thunderbolts  hurled  on  him  by  Lakshmana,  was  dazed 

*55 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

awhile,  his  senses  stupefied.  Thereafter,  beholding  the  valiant 
son  of  Dasaratha  standing  in  the  held,  he  hung  himself  upon  him, 
his  eyes  red  with  anger  and,  drawing  near,  he  began  to  taunt  him 
afresh,  saying : — 

"  How  is  it  that  thou  hast  forgotten  my  prowess,  when  at  the 
first  encounter  thou  and  thy  brother  were  bound  and  laid  low, 
thou  who  dost  now  seek  to  enter  into  combat  with  me  anew  ? 
In  that  great  struggle  under  mine  arrows  resembling  thunder- 
bolts, both  of  you  with  your  followers  were  first  felled  to  the 
earth  by  me  and  then  deprived  of  your  senses. 

"  Meseems  it  has  escaped  thy  memory !  Since  thou  hast 
dared  to  challenge  me,  it  is  clear  thou  desirest  to  enter  the  abode 
of  Yama !  If,  at  the  first  assault  thou  didst  fail  to  recognize  my 
superior  strength,  I  shall  soon  demonstrate  it  to  thee;  stay 
therefore  and  face  me  with  resolution  !  " 

Speaking  thus,  he  pierced  Lakshmana  with  seven  arrows  and 
Hanuman  with  ten  powerful  whetted  shafts ;  thereafter  with 
re-doubled  fury,  Indrajita  pierced  Bibishana  with  a  hundred 
well-aimed  darts.  Seeing  this,  the  younger  brother  of  Rama, 
unmoved,  began  to  laugh,  saying : — 

"  This  is  nothing !  "  and  that  lion  among  men,  Lakshmana, 
undaunted,  taking  up  some  dreadful  darts,  hurled  them  in  anger 
on  Ravani  in  the  fight,  saying : — 

"  Nay,  it  is  not  thus  armed  that  warriors  enter  the  fray,  O 
Night  Ranger !  Thy  darts  are  trifling  and  without  power, 
conducing  to  mine  ease ;  it  is  undoubtedly  not  in  this  wise  that 
brave  men  fight !  " 

With  these  words,  he,  from  his  bow,  loosed  a  shower  of 
arrows  on  his  adversary.  Shattered  by  Lakshmana's  shafts,  the 
heavy  golden  armour  of  the  titan  fell  to  pieces  on  the  floor  of  the 
chariot,  like  a  mass  of  stars  falling  from  the  sky.  His  coat  of 
mail  riven,  riddled  with  wounds  inflicted  by  Narachas,  the 
valiant  Indrajita  resembled  the  rising  sun  and,  full  of  ire,  the 
courageous  son  of  Ravana  of  redoubtable  valour,  struck  Laksh- 
mana with  a  thousand  shafts,  cleaving  his  celestial  armour. 
Then,  exchanging  blow  for  blow,  they  rushed  on  each  other  and 
breathing  heavily,  engaged  in  a  terrible  struggle  and,  in  the 
twinkling  of  an  eye,  their  limbs  were  lacerated  by  arrows  and 
from  every  part  of  their  bodies  the  blood  flowed. 
256 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

For  a  long  time  these  two  valiant  warriors  tore  each  other 
with  their  sharp  weapons  and,  in  their  unbridled  energy,  the 
two  skilled  combatants  sought  to  overcome  each  other.  Both 
riddled  with  a  mass  of  arrows,  their  armour  and  standards 
shattered,  they  caused  the  hot  blood  to  flow,  as  waterfalls  let 
loose  their  torrents,  and  they  let  a  dreadful  hail  of  missiles  fly 
with  a  great  clamour,  like  unto  the  dark  destructive  clouds  of 
doom,  loosing  their  floods  from  the  sky. 

For  a  long  time  they  fought  thus  without  turning  back  or 
experiencing  any  fatigue  and  those  foremost  of  archers  let  fly 
their  shafts  again  and  again,  and  the  multi-shaped  darts  crossed 
and  re-crossed  each  other  in  the  air.  With  agility,  speed  and 
grace,  the  struggle  between  man  and  titan  continued  with  an 
appalling  din  and  each,  on  his  side,  raised  a  tremendous  clamour 
inspiring  terror,  like  unto  a  fearful  tempest  and  the  sound  of 
those  two  redoubtable  warriors  In  desperate  combat  resembled 
two  clouds  clashing  in  the  sky.  With  golden-footed  Narachas, 
those  two  warriors,  sought  to  overcome  one  another,  inflicting 
wounds  from  which  rivers  of  blood  flowed  and  from  their 
pierced  bodies  the  golden-hafted  arrows,  covered  with  blood,  fell 
to  the  earth  in  which  they  buried  themselves.  By  thousands  their 
whetted  shafts  converged  in  the  sky,  cleaving  and  riving  each 
other,  and  both  let  fall  a  formidable  mass  of  darts  in  the  struggle, 
so  that  they  appeared  like  heaps  of  Kusha  Grass  destined  for 
two  sacrificial  fires.  Thebodiesof  those  illustrious  heroes,  full  of 
wounds,  shon  e  like  a  Kimshuka  or  a  Shalmali  Tree,  leaf-less  and  in 
full  flower  in  the  forest;  and  the  impact  was  appalling,  as  Indrajita 
and  Lakshmana  fougbt,  each  desirous  of  overcoming  the  other. 

Lakshmana  battled  with  Ravani  and  Ravani  with  Lakshmana, 
each  striking  the  other  without  ceasing  and  the  streams  of  arrows 
buried  in  their  flesh  gave  those  two  powerful  warriors  the 
appearance  of  two  hills  covered  with  trees,  and  their  limbs 
streaming  with  blood,  riddled  with  arrows,  shone  like  two  fires. 

Thus  did  they  fight  for  a  long  time  without  turning  back  in 
combat  or  giving  way  to  exhaustion.  Nevertheless,  in  order  to 
allow  the  invincible  Lakshmana,  ever  in  the  forefront  of  the 
fight,  to  overcome  the  fatigue  of  combat,  the  magnanimous 
Bibishana  threw  himself  into  the  fray  remaining  near  him  to 
lend  him  his  support.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    90 

Indrajita  loses  Ms  Charioteer,  Chariot  and  Horses 

Seeing  the  desperate  struggle  between  man  and  titan,  who 
resembled  two  elephants  with  broken  tusks  desirous  of  over- 
coming each  other,  Ravana's  valiant  brother,  curious  to  behold 
the  outcome  of  the  duel,  stood  in  the  forefront  of  the  battle,  his 
excellent  bow  in  his  hand. 

Standing  erect,  he  stretched  his  great  bow,  letting  fly  long 
and  pointed  arrows  on  the  titans  and  these  shafts  of  burning 
impact,  falling  thick  and  fast,  tore  the  demons  to  pieces  as  a 
thunderbolt  rives  the  high  mountains. 

Then,  in  their  turn,  Bibishana's  followers,  the  foremost  of 
warriors,  arming  themselves  with  maces,  swords  and  harpoons, 
struck  the  valiant  titans  in  the  fight  and,  surrounded  by  his 
companions,  Bibishana  resembled  a  full-grown  elephant  in  the 
midst  of  young  tuskers  pressing  dose  to  him. 

In  order  to  encourage  the  monkeys,  whose  dearest  wish  was 
to  slaughter  their  foes,  Bibishana,  the  foremost  of  the  titans, 
conversant  with  what  was  fitting  to  the  occasion,  uttered  these 
pertinent  words  to  them,  saying : — 

"  Indrajita  is  the  sole  support  of  the  King  of  the  Titans  and 
this  is  all  that  is  left  of  his  army,  why  therefore,  O  Foremost  of 
the  Monkeys,  have  you  relaxed  your  efforts  ?  This  wicked 
wretch  being  slain  in  the  fore-front  of  battle,  all  the  titan  warriors, 
save  Ravana,  have  been  slain !  The  valiant  Prahasta  is  dead  and 
the  all-powerful  Nikumbha  also,  Kumbhakarna,  Kumbha, 
Dhumraksha,  Jambumali,  Mahamali,  Tikshnavega,  Ashani- 
prabha,  Suptagna,  Yajnakopa,  Vajradamshtra,  Samhradin, 
Vikata,  Arighna,  Tapana  and  Mainda,  Praghasa  as  well  as 
Prajangha  and  Jangha,  Agniketu,  Durdharsha,  Rashmiketu  who 
was  full  of  energy,  Vidyujjihva,  Dvijihva  and  Akampana, 
Suparshva,  Shakramali,  Kampana,  Devantaka  and  Narantaka 
who  was  full  of  valour.  By  slaying  all  these  countless  and 
exceedingly  powerful  titans,  you  have  swum  the  ocean  and  now 
258 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

it  is  for  you  but  to  cross  the  hoof  mark  of  a  cow.  Attack  the 
titans  who  still  remain,  O  Monkeys ;  all  these  warriors,  whose 
strength  has  filled  them  with  pride,  have  perished  in  the  fight. 
It  is  not  fitting  for  me  to  slay  my  father's  son,  but,  laying  aside  all 
pity  for  Rama's  sake,  I  will  put  an  end  to  my  brother's  offspring ; 
yet  though  I  desire  to  slay  him,  tears  fill  mine  eyes  and  deter  me ; 
the  long-armed  Lakshmana  will  best  know  how  to  subdue  him  ! 
O  Monkeys,  closing  in  upon  him,  place  yourselves  so  that  you 
may  wipe  out  those  who  stand  near  to  him." 

Thus  incited  by  the  exceedingly  illustrious  titan,  the  foremost 
of  the  monkeys  demonstrated  their  delight  by  lashing  their  tails, 
and  thereafter  those  tigers  among  the  Flavamgamas,  amidst 
repeated  clapping  of  hands,  emitted  every  kind  of  cry,  like 
peacocks  on  beholding  the  clouds. 

Jambavan  too  was  surrounded  by  his  leaders  and  their  forces 
and  they  assailed  the  titans  with  their  nails  and  teeth  and  blows 
from  stones.  Thereafter  that  Lord  of  the  Bears  decimated  the 
titans,  who,  banishing  all  fear,  full  of  vigour,  overwhelmed  him 
with  countless  missiles  such  as  darts,  axes,  sharp  pikes,  lances 
and  spears,  striking  him,  their  exterminator,  in  the  fray. 

Thereupon  a  formidable  conflict  ensued  between  monkeys 
and  titans,  like  unto  the  fearful  contest  between  the  Gods  and 
the  Asuras  fired  with  wrath,  and  Hanuman,  enraged,  broke  off  a 
mountain  peak  and  having  caused  Lakshmana  to  dismount, 
slew  the  titans  in  their  thousands.  Meanwhile  after  a  fearful 
combat  with  his  maternal  uncle,  the  valiant  Indrajita,  slayer  of 
his  foes,  threw  himself  afresh  on  Lakshmana  and  a  desperate 
duel  arose  between  those  two  heroes  amidst  the  general  conflict. 
Then  those  valiant  warriors  let  loose  a  rain  of  missiles  with 
which  they  overwhelmed  each  other  and,  in  the  twinkling  of  an 
eye,  they  disappeared  under  a  hail  of  arrows,  as  the  glowing  sun 
and  the  brightness  of  the  moon  under  clouds  at  the  end  of 
summer.  Their  movements  were  so  swift  that  one  was  unable  to 
perceive  when  they  took  up  their  bows  or  stretched  them  or 
changed  hands  or  loosed  their  shafts  or  selected  or  separated 
them  or  when  they  closed  their  fists  or  took  aim  and  launched  a 
succession  of  arrows  with  force,  filling  the  sky  on  every  side,  nor 
was  any  object  distinguishable.  Lakshmana  struck  Ravani  and 
Ravani,  in  his  turn,  struck  Lakshmana  and  a  general  confusion 
259 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

arose  between  them  during  the  combat.  Barbed  and  pointed 
shafts,  loosed  by  those  two  warriors,  filled  the  space  in  the 
heavens  as  it  were  and  those  whetted  darts,  that  fell  in  hundreds, 
spread  over  the  cardinal  points  and  the  intermediate  regions,  so 
that  everything  was  engulfed  in  darkness  and  extreme  terror 
took  possession  of  all  beings. 

Then  the  orb  of  a  thousand  rays  sank  behind  the  Asta 
Mountains  enveloped  in  shadow,  and  torrents  of  blood  flowed 
that  day  and  fearful  beasts  of  prey  emitted  full-throated  howls. 

"  May  good  fortune  befall  the  worlds !  "  murmured  the  great 
Rishis,  whilst  the  Gandharvas  with  the  Charanas,  panic-stricken, 
fled  away. 

Meanwhile  Saumitri  with  four  arrows  pierced  the  four  black 
steeds  caparisoned  in  gold  of  that  Indra  among  the  Titans,  and, 
with  the  aid  of  a  sharp,  yellow,  shining  and  terrible  Bhalla, 
furnished  with  beautiful  plumes,  resembling  Mahendra's 
thunderbolt,  resounding  like  the  clang  of  a  gauntlet  hurled  with 
full  force,  that  mighty  son  of  Raghu  severed  the  head  of  the 
charioteer  from  his  shoulders  while  he  circled  round. 

Thereupon,  his  charioteer  slain,  Mandodari's  valiant  son 
seized  the  reins  himself,  taking  up  his  bow ;  and  it  was  marvel- 
lous to  behold  him  driving  his  chariot  as  he  fought.  Yet  while 
his  hands  were  occupied  with  the  steeds,  his  adversary  struck 
him  with  pointed  darts  and  while  he  attended  to  his  bow,  the 
horses  were  pierced  with  arrows.  Then  Indrajita,  even  though 
his  horses  were  riddled  with  darts,  caused  them  to  circle  bravely 
under  the  arrows  loosed  by  Saumitri  with  exceeding  lightness  of 
hand.  Seeing  his  charioteer  slain  in  the  fight  however,  the  son 
of  Ravana  lost  his  zest  for  combat  and  grew  anxious,  and  observ- 
ing the  titan's  countenance  change,  the  monkey  leaders  began  to 
acclaim  Lakshmana  in  the  height  of  joy.  Thereafter  Pramathin, 
Rabhasa,  Sharabha  and  Gandhamadana,  eager  to  bring  matters 
to  a  close,  struck  a  mighty  blow,  and  those  foremost  of  monkeys, 
endowed  with  extreme  vigour  and  remarkable  valour,  with  a 
rapid  bound,  threw  themselves  on  the  four  magnificent  steeds 
of  Indrajita. 

Under  the  weight  of  those  monkeys  who  resembled  mountains, 
the  horses  threw  up  torrents  of  blood  and  thereafter,  crushed 
and  mangled,  fell  lifeless  on  the  earth.  Having  slain  the 
360 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

titan's  steeds  and  shattered  bis  chariot,  the  monkeys,  with  a 
further  bound,  returned  to  Lakshmana's  side. 

Springing  from  his  car,  the  horses  having  perished,  and  his 
charioteer  being  slain,  Ravani  caused  a  shower  of  darts  to  fall  on 
Saumitri,  whereupon,  like  unto  Mahendra,  Lakshmana  over- 
whelmed Indrajita  with  shafts  and  he,  righting  on  foot,  his  excellent 
steeds  being  dead,  loosed  countless  whetted  and  marvellous  darts 
on  Saumitri  in  the  fight. 


CHAPTER     91 

The  Death  of  Indrajita 

The  mighty  Ranger  of  the  Night,  Indrajita,  his  horses  slain) 
stood  in  the  field  in  a  paroxysm  of  fury,  flaming  with  valour,  and 
in  their  desire  to  triumph,  those  two  archers,  armed  with  bows, 
hurled  themselves  against  one  another  like  two  mighty  elephants 
in  the  forest. 

Rushing  this  way  and  that,  titans  and  monkeys  slew  each 
other,  not  wishing  to  abandon  their  leaders.  At  that  moment, 
the  son  of  Ravana  began  to  encourage  the  titans  and  praised  and 
gladdened  them  by  addressing  them  thus : — 

'*  O  Foremost  of  the  Titans,  a  profound  darkness  reigns  over 
all  regions  nor  can  we  distinguish  between  ourselves  and  the 
enemy,  therefore  fight  fearlessly  in  order  to  delude  the  monkeys 
and  I  too  shall  return  to  enter  into  combat  in  another  chariot ! 
O  Brave  Companions,  do  not  suffer  the  monkeys  to  triumph 
whilst  I  am  in  the  city !  " 

At  these  words,  the  son  of  Ravana,  slayer  of  his  foes,  eluding 
the  vigilance  of  the  dwellers  in  the  woods,  re-entered  the  City  of 
Lanka,  in  order  to  provide  himself  with  a  fresh  chariot ;  and  he 
caused  a  car  embellished  with  magnificent  gilding,  furnished 
with  javelins,  swords  and  arrows,  harnessed  to  the  most  excellent 
of  steeds  and  driven  by  a  skilful  and  intelligent  charioteer  to  be 
made  ready,  whereafter  the  illustrious  Ravani,  victor  in  combat, 
ascended  it.    Surrounded  by  the  foremost  of  battalions,  the 

t  361 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

valiant  son  of  Mandodari,  Indrajita,  urged  on  by  the  force  of 
destiny,  left  the  city  and,  drawn  by  swift  steeds,  with  exceeding 
courage  he  rushed  on  Lakshmana  and  Bibishana  who  accom- 
panied him. 

Beholding  the  crafty  son  of  Ravana,  mounted  in  a  chariot, 
Saumitri,  the  intrepid  monkeys  and  the  Titan  Bibishana  were 
astonished  j  Indrajita,  however,  struck  down  the  foremost  of 
the  monkeys  with  fury.  Under  the  clouds  of  arrows  falling  in 
hundreds  and  thousands,  Ravani,  victorious  in  combat,  stretch- 
ing his  bow  to  a  circle,  slew  the  monkeys  in  his  wrath,  displaying 
his  extreme  skill,  and  the  monkeys,  overwhelmed  by  the  Narachas 
of  dreadful  impetus,  took  refuge  with  Saumitri,  as  all  beings  with 
Prajapati.  Thereupon,  inflamed  with  martial  ardour,  that 
descendant  of  Raghu  severed  the  bow  of  Indrajita,  thus  demon- 
strating his  fieetness  of  hard  but  he,  seizing  hold  of  another, 
hastened  to  string  it,  yet  Laksnmana  shattered  it  also  with  three 
arrows  and,  having  broken  his  weapons  thus,  Saumitri  pierced 
Ravani's  breast  with  five  darts  like  unto  venomous  snakes.  Then 
these  shafts,  leaving  that  great  bow,  having  entered  Iudrajita's 
body,  fell  to  the  earth  like  huge  red  serpents. 

His  weapon  severed,  vomiting  blood,  Ravani  took  hold  of 
another  powerful  bow  with  its  stout  cord  and,  aiming  at  Laksh- 
mana, with  extreme  speed  caused  a  shower  of  missiles  to  fall 
upon  him,  like  unto  Purandara  letting  loose  his  floods.  Yet, 
irresistible  as  that  hail  of  arrows,  poured  down  by  Indrajita  was, 
Lakshmana,  the  Conqueror  of  his  Foes,  standing  immoveable, 
repelled  them. 

Thus  did  Ravani  witness  Lakshmana's  marvellous  prowess,  he 
who  was  the  intrepid  and  valiant  son  of  Raghu.  Thereafter 
Lakshmana,  in  fury,  pierced  each  of  those  titans  with  three 
shafts  in  the  fight,  manifesting  the  velocity  of  his  arrows,  and 
Indrajita,  on  his  side,  riddled  him  with  a  hail  of  shafts. 

Then  that  India  among  the  Titans,  grievously  wounded  by  his 
valiant  adversary,  the  slayer  of  his  foes,  loosed  a  continuous 
shower  of  arrows  on  Lakshmana  but,  ere  they  reached  him,  they 
were  severed  by  the  sharp  spear  of  that  warrior,  the  destroyer  of 
his  enemies,  and  Lakshmana,  with  a  crescent-shaped  arrow,  cut 
off  the  head  of  Indrajita's  charioteer  in  his  excellent  car,  while 
he  was  coursing  here  and  there. 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Deprived  of  their  driver,  the  horses,  without  deviating  from 
their  course,  continued  to  draw  the  chariot,  advancing  and 
describing  circles  in  a  marvellous  manner.  Thereupon  Saumitri, 
of  fixed  courage,  unable  to  control  his  anger,  let  fly  his  shafts 
against  the  tiran's  steeds  causing  them  to  take  fright. 

Provoked  by  this  action,  the  son  of  Ravana  struck  the  terrible 
Saumitri  with  his  ten  arrows  and  those  shafts,  equal  to  lightning, 
that  seemed  composed  of  all  the  poisons,  glanced  off  his  golden 
armour. 

Seeing  that  his  coat  of  mail  was  impenetrable,  the  son  of 
Ravana,  Indrajita,  in  a  transport  of  rage,  manifesting  his  lightness 
of  hand,  struck  Lakshmana  in  the  forehead  with  three  arrows  of 
graceful  joints,  and  that  illustrious  warrior,  the  joy  of  the  House 
of  Raghu,  with  three  shafts  embedded  in  his  forehead,  shone  in 
the  forefront  of  battle  like  unto  a  triple  mountain.  Albeit  thus 
smitten  by  the  titan's  arrows,  Lakshmana,  in  his  turn,  instantly 
let  fly  five  shafts  which  struck  Indrajita,  who  was  adorned  with 
lovely  earrings,  full  in  the  face. 

Thereafter  Lakshmana  and  Indrajita,  warriors  of  exceeding 
prowess,  armed  with  powerful  and  mighty  bows,  overwhelmed 
each  other  with  sharp  arrows.  With  their  limbs  streaming  with 
blood,  those  two  heroes,  Lakshmana  and  Indrajita,  at  that 
instant  shone  on  the  field  of  battle  like  two  Kimshuka  Trees  in 
flower  and  each  hurling  himself  on  the  other  desirous  of  victory, 
pierced  his  opponent's  limbs  with  formidable  arrows.  Filled 
with  martial  ardour,  the  son  of  Ravana  smote  Bibishana's 
handsome  countenance  with  three  darts  and,  having  pierced  that 
Indra  of  the  Titans  with  three  iron-tipped  shafts,  he  struck  all 
the  monkey  leaders  one  after  the  other. 

Highly  provoked,  the  exceedingly  energetic  Bibishana  felled 
the  horses  of  the  wicked  Ravani  with  a  mace,  whereupon  the 
mighty  Indrajita,  springing  down  from  his  car,  his  horses  slain 
and  his  charioteer  dead,  hurled  a  javelin  on  his  paternal  uncle. 

Beholding  this,  the  enhancer  of  Surnitra's  delight,  with  his 
sharp  arrow,  severed  it  in  ten  pieces  in  its  flight  and  it  fell  on  the 
earth.  Thereafter  Bibishana,  his  mighty  bow  in  his  hand,  let 
fly  five  Marganas,  the  impact  of  which  being  equal  to  lightning, 
and  struck  Indrajita,  whose  horses  had  been  slain,  in  the  breast. 
Having  passed  through  his  body,  those  golden-hafted  arrows, 
*3 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

that  flew  straight  to  their  target,  were  stained  with  blood  so  that 
they  resembled  huge  red  serpents. 

Then,  highly  incensed  against  his  paternal  uncle,  Indrajita, 
standing  in  the  midst  of  the  titans,  selected  a  marvellous  arrow 
of  great  power  that  he  had  received  from  Yama  and,  seeing  him 
place  that  formidable  shaft  on  his  bow,  the  valiant  and  intrepid 
Lakshmana  took  up  one  of  immeasurable  power  which  had  been 
bestowed  on  him  during  sleep  by  the  God  Kuvera,  and  that 
weapon  was  irresistible,  nor  could  the  Gods  nor  the  Asuras  with 
their  leaders  stand  before  it. 

And  those  excellent  bows,  resembling  maces,  when  stretched 
by  their  arms,  emitted  a  piercing  sound  like  unto  two  ospreys 
and  the  two  powerful  arrows  notched  on  those  wonderful  bent 
bows  lit  up  the  faces  of  the  two  heroes  with  a  vivid  glow.  Those 
barbed  shafts  loosed  from  the  bows  illumined  the  heavens, 
striking  against  each  other  with  a  violent  impact  and  the  shock  of 
those  formidable  weapons  as  they  struck  against  each  other 
caused  them  to  burst  into  flame,  emitting  sparks  and  smoke. 
Like  unto  two  great  planets  colliding  together,  they  fell  shattered 
in  a  hundred  pieces  on  the  battlefield. 

Seeing  those  weapons  severed  and  broken  in  the  forefront  of 
the  battle,  Lakshmana  and  Indrajita  were  seized  with  mortifica- 
tion and  fury  and,  in  his  anger,  Sauraitri  armed  himself  with 
Varuna's  shaft  whilst  Mahendra's  conqueror,  fighting  on  foot, 
let  fly  Rudra's  weapon  in  the  fight  which  shattered  Varuna's 
dart,  despite  its  immense  potency.  Thereafter,  in  his  ire,  the 
illustrious  Indrajita,  victorious  in  combat,  as  if  about  to  destroy 
the  worlds,  took  up  the  filming  Agneya  Weapon  but  the  valiant 
Lakshmana  diverted  it  with  the  Solar  Dart  and,  seeing  his  shaft 
thus  baffled,  Ravani,  maddened  with  anger,  seized  hold  of  the 
Asura  Weapon  that  was  sharp  and  fatal  to  its  foe.  Then  from 
his  bow  sped  shining  Kutamudgaras,  spears,  Bushundis,  maces, 
swords  and  axes  and,  beholding  that  dire  and  dreadful  weapon, 
irresistible  to  all  beings,  the  destroyer  of  every  missile,  the 
illustrious  Lakshmana  arrested  it  with  the  aid  of  the  Maheshwara 
Weapon. 

Thereupon  a  prodigious  struggle  arose  between  the  rivals, 
causing  the  hair  to  stand  on  end  and,  from  all  sides,  Beings, 
standing  in  the  sky  made  a  circle  round  Lakshmana  and  the 
264 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

heavens  were  filled  with  a  host  of  Beings  overcome  with  astonish- 
ment at  the  fearful  tumult  arising  from  that  dread  conflict 
between  monkeys  and  titans.  Rishis,  Pitris,  Gandharvas, 
Garudas  and  Uragas  with  Shatakratu  at  their  head  watched  over 
Lakshmana  during  the  fight  and,  in  that  instant,  the  younger 
brother  of  Raghava  took  up  the  foremost  of  shafts,  the  Avya 
Weapon  of  flaming  impact,  in  order  to  transfix  Ravana's  son,  and 
also  the  well-plumed  and  gilded  dart,  skilfully  fashioned,  to  which 
the  Celestial  Host  paid  homage  and  with  which  Shakra,  that 
mighty  Lord  of  great  energy,  who  is  drawn  by  bay  horses, 
formerly  overcame  the  Danavas  in  the  war  between  Gods  and 
Asuras.  That  weapon  of  Indra's,  undefeated  in  combat,  fore- 
most of  shafts  was  placed  by  Saumitri  on  the  most  excellent  of 
bows  and  the  fortunate  Lakshmana,  in  order  to  achieve  his 
purpose,  spoke  to  the  presiding  Deity  of  that  weapon,  thus ; — 

"  If  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  is  truly  virtuous  and  loyal  and, 
in  feats  of  heroism  has  no  rival,  then  slay  the  son  of  Ravana !  " 

Thus  speaking,  that  warrior,  the  slayer  of  his  foes,  stretched 
his  bow  up  to  his  ear  and  let  fly  an  arrow  united  to  Indra's 
weapon  on  Ravani  in  the  fight,  that  was  incapable  of  missing  its 
target,  and  it  severed  the  lovely  head  of  Indrajita,  graced  with 
earrings  and  its  casque,  causing  it  to  roll  on  the  earth.  Separated 
from  the  body,  Indrajita's  huge  head,  streaming  with  blood, 
resembled  a  golden  ball  thrown  on  the  ground  ;  and  the  son  of 
Ravana  fell  dead  on  the  battlefield  with  his  armour,  his  helmet 
and  his  broken  bow. 

Then  all  the  monkeys  with  Bibishana,  beholding  the  corpse, 
shouted  in  exultation,  as  the  Gods  rejoiced  at  the  death  of 
Vritra,  and  in  the  skies,  the  Bhutas,  magnanimous  Rishis, 
Gandharvas  and  Apsaras,  on  beholding  the  leaders  of  the  great 
titan  army  scattering  on  all  sides,  harassed  by  the  victorious 
monkeys,  emitted  shouts  of  triumph. 

Hard  pressed  by  the  monkeys,  the  titans,  flinging  down  their 
arms,  hastily  fled  in  disorder  towards  Lanka  and,  in  the  general 
stampede  the  titans,  throwing  away  their  weapons,  lances, 
swords  and  axes,  ran  in  all  directions  at  once.  Terror-stricken, 
harried  by  the  monkeys,  some  re-entered  Lanka,  others  threw 
themselves  into  the  sea  or  took  refuge  on  the  mountain.  Now 
that  Indrajita  lay  dead  on  the  battlefield,  the  titans  fled  away  in 
*5 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

their  thousands.  As  the  sun  withdraws  behind  the  Asta  Moun- 
tain and  its  rays  disappear,  so  did  the  titans  vanish  from  the 
horizon  when  Indrajita  had  fallen-  As  the  solar  orb  with  its  rays 
extinguished  or  a  fire  without  heat,  so  did  that  long-armed 
warrior  lie  bereft  of  life  and  the  world,  freed  from  her  sufferings 
and  delivered  from  her  enemy,  rejoiced !  And  the  blessed 
Shakra  was  exceedingly  gratified  at  the  death  of  that  titan  of  evil 
deeds  and  the  great  Rishis  also,  whilst  in  the  heavens,  the  Gods 
could  be  heard  striking  their  gongs  and  the  dancing  Apsaras  and 
the  magnanimous  Gandharvas  caused  a  rain  of  flowers  to  fall 
that  was  marvellous  to  behold. 

On  the  death  of  that  titan  of  cruel  exploits,  peace  reigned,  the 
waters  became  limpid,  the  air  pure  and  Devas  and  Danavas 
rejoiced  at  the  fall  of  one  who  was  a  source  of  terror  to  all  the 
worlds.  Thereafter  a  shout  of  triumph  arose  from  the  Devas, 
Gandharvas  and  Danavas  who  said  : — 

"  Now  let  the  Brahmins  go  about  their  pursuits  without 
anxiety,  their  sins  removed  !  " 

Then  the  monkey  leaders,  beholding  that  Bull  among  the 
Nairritas  slain  in  battle,  whose  prowess  was  irresistible,  paid 
homage  to  Lakshmana  and  Bibishana,  Hanuman  and  Jambavan ; 
and  all  the  Plavamgamas,  growling  and  leaping  with  chattering  of 
jaws,  surrounded  that  descendant  of  Raghu,  lashing  their  tails 
and  clapping  their  hands.  *  Victory  to  Prince  Lakshmana  ! '  rose 
the  cry  and,  embracing  each  other,  the  monkeys,  their  hearts 
filled  with  joy,  hymned  the  praises  of  Lakshmana  in  every  way. 

Witnessing  that  difficult  feat  of  Lakshmana's,  he  who  was  the 
delight  of  his  friends  and  seeing  the  corpse  of  Indra's  adversary, 
the  Gods,  highly  gratified,  experienced  supreme  delight.

Lakshmana,  graced  with  auspicious  marks,  his  limbs  bathed  in 
blood,  having  slain  that  conqueror  of  his  foes  on  the  battlefield, 
experienced  supreme  satisfaction.

YUDDHA    KANDA 

Taking  with  him  Jambavan,  Hanuman  and  all  the  inhabitants 
of  the  woods,  the  valiant  and  illustrious  Lakshmana  speedily 
returned  to  Sugriva  and  Raghava,  leaning  on  Bibishana  and 
Hanuman.  Thereafter,  having  circumambulated  Rama  and 
paid  obeisance  to  him,  Saumitri  stood  beside  his  brother  as 
Upendra  by  Indra. 

Then  that  hero,  Bibishana,  approaching  with  a  look  which 
itself  was  eloquent  of  delight,  described  Indrajita's  fearful  end 
and  it  was  with  joy  that  Rama  learned  how  the  head  of  Ravani 
had  been  severed  by  the  great-souled  Lakshmana  and  the 
tidings  that  Indrajita  had  fallen  under  Lakshmana's  blows  filled 
that  valiant  prince  with  unequalled  felicity  so  that  he  cried 
out: — 

"  Well  done,  O  Lakshmana,  this  exceedingly  difficult  feat 
pleases  me  !    Ravani's  death  means  victory,  be  assured  thereof !  " 

Thereafter,  smelling  the  head  of  Lakshmana,  who  had 
increased  his  glory  yet  who  was  abashed,  the  mighty  Rama  caused 
him  to  be  seated  on  his  lap  and,  with  gentle  strength,  having 
clasped  his  brother,  who  was  wounded,  to  his  breast,  he  gazed 
upon  him  tenderly  again  and  again.  Then  Rama,  smelling  his 
head  once  more,  passed  his  hand  rapidly  over  his  body  and,  in 
order  to  sooth  him,  said : — 

"  Thou  hast  accomplished  an  auspicious  and  highly  momen- 
tous feat,  O  Thou  whose  exploits  are  beyond  the  power  of  others  ! 
Now  that  his  son  is  slain,  I  deem  Ravana  to  be  defeated.  To-day 
the  death  of  that  perverse  wretch  confers  victory  over  Ravana, 
the  Scourge  of  Men,  upon  me,  be  thou  blessed,  O  Warrior ! 
Thou  hast  severed  the  right  arm  of  the  King  of  the  Titans  on 
which  he  leant  for  support  1  Bibishana  and  Hanuman  too,  bore 
themselves  with  valour  in  the  great  fight.  In  three  days,  that 
warrior  was  utterly  vanquished ;  from  now  I  am  delivered  from 
my  foes,  for  Ravana  will  assuredly  come  forth,  setting  out  with 
considerable  forces.  When,  on  hearing  of  the  death  of  his  son, 
which  will  overwhelm  him  with  grief,  the  King  of  the  Titans 
advances  surrounded  by  his  vast  army,  I  shall  encircle  him  with 
my  powerful  forces  and  slay  him,  difficult  though  it  be.  The 
conqueror  of  Indra  having  fallen  in  combat  with  thee,  under  thy 
direction,  O  Lakshmana,  neither  Sita  nor  the  earth  itself  would 
be  hard  to  regain  I " 

a«7 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Having  lavished  comfort  and  caresses  on  his  brother,  the  son 
of  Raghu,  Rama,  joyfully  addressed  Sushena,  saying : — 

"  Do  thou  pluck  out  the  arrows  from  the  highly  intelligent 
Saumitri,  who  is  ever  devoted  to  his  friends,  and  restore  him. 
Speedily  heal  the  wounds  of  Saumitri,  who  is  attached  to  his 
friends,  and  do  thou  nurse  back  to  health  all  those  who  received 
blows  and  wounds  in  the  conflict,  those  bears  and  monkeys  whose 
valiant  battalions  have  trees  as  their  weapons." 

At  these  words  of  Rama,  the  powerful  monkey  leader,  Sushena, 
administered  a  sovereign  remedy  to  Lakshmana's  nostrils  and 
having  inhaled  it,  that  hero  was  at  once  liberated  from  his  darts 
and  wounds.  Restored  to  his  normal  state  and  freed  from  the 
arrows,  his  burning  pains  at  an  end,  his  fever  suddenly  allayed, 
Saumitri  experienced  supreme  delight.  Thereupon  Rama,  the 
King  of  the  Plavagas,  Bibishana  and  the  valiant  Chief  of  the 
Bears  with  their  forces,  seeing  Saumitri  standing  free  from  pain, 
rejoiced  exceedingly. 

Then  that  supremely  difficult  exploit  of  Lakshmana's  was 
praised  by  Dasarathi  of  great  soul,  and,  recollecting  that  the 
conqueror  of  Indra  had  fallen  in  the  fight,  the  King  of  the 
Monkeys  was  filled  with  joy. 


chapter   93 

Havana's  Grief  on  hearing  of  his  Son's  Death 

Poulastya's  ambassadors,  having  learnt  of  Indrajita's  death  and 
confirmed  it,  conveyed  the  tidings  to  Dashagriva  in  all  haste, 
saying : — 

"  O  Great  King,  Thine  illustrious  son  has  been  slain  by 
Lakshmana,  who  was  accompanied  by  Bibishana ;  we  were 
witness  thereof !  That  hero,  confronted  by  a  hero,  measured  his 
strength  with  Lakshmana's !  Thy  son,  undefeated  in  any 
combat,  he  who  triumphed  over  the  Gods  with  Indra  at  their 
head,  has  gone  to  the  Celestial  Regions,  having  been  overwhelmed 
by  Lakshmana's  shafts  !  " 

Hearing  of  the  terrible,  cruel  and  grievous  end  of  bis  son  on 
268 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

the  battlefield,  that  bull  among  the  titans  swooned  away  and  only 
came  to  himself  after  a  long  time. 

Distracted  with  grief  on  account  of  his  son's  death,  that 
unfortunate  one,  beside  himself,  burst  into  lamentation,  crying:—- 

"  O  Thou,  the  Conqueror  of  Indra,  how  hast  thou  suffered 
thyself  to  be  overcome  by  Lakshmana  this  day  ?  In  thy  wrath, 
wast  thou  not  able  to  strike  down  Kala  and  Antaka  themselves 
with  thy  shafts,  as  also  the  peak  of  the  Mandara  Mountain  ? 
How  much  more  was  it  possible  for  thee  to  strike  down  Laksh- 
mana in  the  fight  ?  Hereafter  the  King  of  Death  will  be  held  in 
greater  reverence  by  me,  since  to-day  he  has  brought  thee  under 
the  sway  of  destiny,  O  Long-armed  Warrior  !  Even  among  the 
Celestial  Host,  this  is  the  path  trodden  by  those  skilful  warriors 
who  wage  a  brave  fight !  He  who  is  slain  in  the  service  of  his 
lord  goes  to  the  heavenly  regions.  Seeing  Indra jita  slain  this 
day,  the  Gods  and  all  the  Guardians  of  the  World,  free  from 
anxiety  will  sleep  in  peace !  Now  the  Three  Worlds  and  the 
entire  earth  with  its  woods  appears  deserted  to  me  without  the 
only  Indrajita.  To-day  I  shall  hear  the  cries  of  the  youthful 
daughters  of  the  Nairritas  in  the  private  apartments,  like  unto 
the  roar  of  elephants  in  a  mountain  cave.  O  Hero,  where  hast 
thou  gone,  relinquishing  thy  right  to  the  throne,  to  Lanka,  the 
titans,  thy  mother,  myself  and  thy  consorts  ?  Assuredly,  I 
should  have  preceded  thee  to  the  abode  of  death  so  that  I  might 
have  received  those  honours  due  to  the  departed,  offered  up  by 
thee,  but  the  contrary  has  taken  place,  O  Hero !  Why  do 
Sugriva,  Lakshmana  and  Raghava  still  live  and  why  hast  thou 
deserted  me  ere  thou  hadst  rid  me  of  this  triple  thorn  ?  " 

Having  first  lamented  thus,  Ravana,  the  King  of  the  Titans 
was  overcome  with  a  violent  rage  on  account  of  the  death  of 
Indrajita  and  the  grief  at  losing  his  son  increased  the  fire  of 
anger  within  him  who  was  irascible  by  nature,  as  in  the  summer 
months  the  rays  of  the  sun  become  more  intense.  From  his  half- 
opened  mouth,  he  seemed  to  breathe  forth  flame  and  smoke  in 
his  rage,  as  Vritra  formerly  from  his,  and  his  eyes,  naturally  red, 
were  further  inflamed  with  ire,  glowing  in  dreadful  wise.  Under 
the  sway  of  anger,  his  aspect,  ever  a  source  of  terror,  caused  him 
to  resemble  the  enraged  Rudra  !  Tears  fell  from  the  eyes  of  that 
infuriated  monster  like  boiling  oil  from  two  flaming  lamps. 
269 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Grinding  his  teeth,  he  made  a  sound  like  unto  the  revolving  of 
the  rod1  with  which  the  Gods  and  Danavas  churned  the  milky 
ocean.  Mad  with  anger,  like  unto  Antaka  eager  to  devour  all 
beings  animate  or  inanimate,  he  allowed  bis  gaze  to  wander  over 
the  four  quarters  of  the  horizon  nor  did  any  titan  dare  approach 
him,  and  in  a  transport  of  rage  the  King  of  the  Titans,  seated 
amidst  his  warriors,  in  order  to  excite  their  ardour,  said  : — 

"  Having  practised  penance  for  thousands  of  years  and 
gratified  Swyambhu  on  countless  occasions,  as  the  fruit  of 
mine  austerities,  he  accorded  me  complete  immunity  from 
Devas  and  Asuras. 

"  Brahma  bestowed  a  coat  of  mail,  that  gleamed  like  the  sun, 
on  me  which,  in  my  conflicts  with  the  Gods  and  Asuras,  none  of 
my  foes,  though  armed  with  thunderbolts,  were  able  to  shatter. 
To-day,  clad  in  that  armour  and  mounted  on  my  chariot  of  war, 
who  will  dare  to  withstand  me,  be  it  Purandara  himself? 

"  The  great  bow  with  its  arrows  bestowed  on  me  when  I 
gratified  Swyambhu,  after  an  encounter  with  Devas  and  Asuras, 
that  redoubtable  bow  will  be  drawn  by  me  to  the  sound  of 
countless  musical  instruments,  in  a  mighty  battle,  to  Rama  and 
Lakshmana's  destruction !  " 

Tormented  by  the  death  of  his  son,  the  ferocious  Ravana, 
overpowered  by  anger,  having  reflected  within  himself,  resolved 
to  slay  Sita.  Rolling  his  reddened  eyes,  that  cruel  and  terrible 
titan,  in  bis  anguish,  said  in  the  presence  of  all  the  Rangers  of 
the  Night,  in  plaintive  tones  : — 

"  My  unfortunate  son,  in  order  to  deceive  the  monkeys, 
having  had  recourse  to  magic,  showed  them  an  illusory  corpse, 
saying : — '  This  is  Sita !  *  Verily  it  shall  become  a  reality  !  I 
shall  slay  Vaidehi  who  is  devoted  to  that  evil  wretch !  " 

Having  spoken  thus,  he  seized  hold  of  a  sword  that  was  well- 
tempered  and  bright  as  the  stainless  sky  and  rushed  out  in  haste 
surrounded  by  his  wives  and  counsellors.  Ravana,  whose  heart 
was  torn  with  grief  on  account  of  his  son,  taking  up  his  sword, 
rushed  out  to  find  Maithili  and  seeing  the  king  setting  out  in  a 
great  rage,  the  titans  emitted  leonine  roars  and  embiacine  each 
other,  said : — 

1  This  refers  to  the  Mountain  Mandara  which  was  used  by  the  Gods  and 
Asuras  as  the  churning  rod. 

270 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

"  To-day  we  shall  see  those  two  brothers  humbled !  In  his 
anger,  Ravana  has  overcome  the  four  Guardians  of  the  World  and 
countless  others  have  fallen  under  his  blows ;  the  Three  Worlds 
have  yielded  up  their  treasure  to  him  whose  prowess  and  valour 
have  no  equal  on  earth  !  " 

As  they  were  speaking  thus,  Ravana,  in  a  transport  of  rage,  was 
rushing  to  where  Sita  was  to  be  found  in  the  Ashoka  Grove,  and, 
though  his  friends  sought  to  restrain  him,  he  ran  on,  as  in  the 
sky  the  planet  Rahu  bears  down  on  Rohini. 

The  irreproachable  Maithili,  in  the  midst  of  the  female 
titans  who  guarded  her,  beholding  that  furious  titan  with  a  great 
sword,  was  seized  with  terror,  and  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  Sita, 
seeing  him  continue  to  advance  with  that  weapon  upraised, 
though  his  friends  sought  to  restrain  him,  in  the  height  of 
misery,  wailing,  uttered  these  words  : — 

"  Beholding  that  wicked  wretch  rushing  upon  me  in  fury,  I, 
who  am  defenceless  but  who  yet  have  a  defender,  fear  that  he 
intends  to  slay  me !  Despite  my  loyalty  to  my  lord,  he  entreated 
me  again  and  again,  saying  *  Be  my  consort  *  and  X  constantly 
repulsed  him.  My  refusal  has  assuredly  caused  him  to  give  way 
to  despair  and,  in  a  transport  of  fury,  he  is  preparing  to  slay  me. 
Or  it  may  be  that  those  two  tigers  among  men,  those  brothers, 
Rama  and  Lakshmana,  have,  on  my  account,  been  cut  down 
to-day  on  the  battlefield.  I  hear  a  great  clashing  of  gongs  and 
the  exultant  shouts  of  innumerable  people  rejoicing  !  Woe  is 
me,  the  two  princes  have  died  for  me  or  else  this  titan  of  cruel 
intent  has  come  to  slay  me  on  account  of  grief  over  his  son  or  he 
has  been  unable  to  slay  Rama  and  Lakshmana  !  Why  did  I  not 
follow  Hanuman's  counsel,  miserable  creature  that  I  am !  If  I 
had  departed,  seated  on  his  back,  I  should  now  be  resting 
happily  in  the  lap  of  my  lord.  Assuredly  Kaushalya's  heart  will 
break  when  she  learns  that  her  son  has  perished  in  the  fight  and, 
weeping,  she  will  recollect  the  birth,  childhood,  youth,  virtuous 
deeds  and  beauty  of  that  magnanimous  hero.  Overcome  with 
despair,  having  offered  up  the  obsequies  in  honour  of  her  dead 
son,  distracted  with  grief,  she  will  ascend  the  funeral  pyre  or  cast 
herself  into  the  river.  Cursed  be  that  wicked  hunch-back 
Manthara  and  her  sinister  counsels ;  it  is  she  who  is  the  cause  of 
the  sufferings  which  will  overwhelm  Kaushalya." 
271 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Hearing  the  unfortunate  Maithili  lamenting  thus,  she,  who 
resembled  Rohini  fallen  under  the  sway  of  Rahu  in  the  absence 
of  the  Moon,  a  virtuous  and  honest  counsellor,  the  sagacious 
Suparshwa,  seeking  with  his  companions  to  restrain  Ravana,  the 
Ring  of  the  Titans,  said  to  him : — 

"  Why,  O  Dashagriva,  dost  thou,  the  younger  brother  of 
Vaishravana  himself,  seek  to  put  Vaidehi  to  death  in  an  access  of 
rage,  disregarding  the  law  ?x  Thou  who  art  a  student  of  the 
Veda,  who  hast  been  purified  by  pious  observances  and  who 
delightest  in  the  scriptures,  how  art  thou  able  to  harbour  the 
thought  of  slaying  a  woman  ?  O  Valiant  Monarch  of  the  Titans, 
spare  the  beautiful  Maithili  and  loose  the  vials  of  thy  wrath  on 
that  man,  entering  into  combat  with  him  with  our  aid.  This  is 
the  fourteenth  day  of  the  dark  fortnight8  and  to-morrow,  on  the 
day  of  the  new  moon,  march  to  victory  surrounded  by  thy 
forces.  Courageous,  armed  with  thy  sword,  in  thine  excellent 
chariot,  a  mighty  car-warrior,  thou  shalt  cut  down  the  terrible 
Dasarathi  and  take  possession  of  Mithila's  daughter !  " 

Thereupon  the  wicked  and  powerful  Ravana,  giving  ear  to  the 
judicious  words  of  his  devoted  counsellor,  returned  to  the 
palace  and  re-entered  the  assembly  hall  surrounded  by  his 
friends. 


chapter   94 

Rama's  Exploits 

Having  entered  the  council  chamber,  the  unhappy  king,  the 
mighty  Ravana,  overwhelmed  by  the  death  of  his  son,  seated  on 
his  throne,  in  the  depth  of  affliction,  breathing  like  an  enraged 
lion,  saluted  the  leaders  of  his  army  and  addressed  them  saying: — 
"  Do  ye  set  out  at  the  head  of  cavalry  with  a  column  of 
chariots,  elephants  and  horses,  with  which  you  are  abundantly 
supplied,  and,  in  the  fight,  hurl  yourselves  upon  Rama  only, 
overwhelming  him  with  a  lain  of  missiles,  like  clouds  in  the  rainy 

1  The  Law  of  Dharma  or  Righteousness.

season.  Thereafter  when  your  sharp  darts  have  pierced  his 
limbs  in  that  great  battle,  to-morrow,  I  myself  will  put  an  end  to 
Rama's  life  in  the  presence  of  all  beings." 

On  this  command  from  their  king,  the  titans  set  out  in  their 
swift-moving  chariots  followed  by  innumerable  battalions. 
Armed  with  maces,  harpoons,  swords,  arrows  and  life-destroying 
axes,  all  those  titans  struck  the  monkeys,  who  countered  them 
with  blows  from  rocks  and  trees.  Then,  as  the  sun  rose,  a  great 
and  terrible  struggle  ensued  between  titans  and  monkeys,  fearful 
to  behold  and  they  struck  each  other  with  countless  shining 
weapons,  javelins,  swords  and  axes  in  the  fray  and  a  prodigious 
dust  storm,  arising  on  account  of  the  battle,  was  laid  again  by  the 
rivers  of  blood  from  titans  and  monkeys.  With  elephants  and 
chariots  as  the  banks,  javelins  as  the  fish,  standards  as  the  trees, 
corpses  as  the  floating  logs,  rivers  of  blood  flowed. 

Though  soaked  in  gore,  the  valiant  monkeys,  leaping  hither 
and  thither  in  the  fight,  hacked  the  banners,  armour,  chariots, 
horses  and  weapons  of  every  kind  to  pieces.  With  their  sharp 
teeth  and  nails  the  Plavamgamas  tore  the  hair,  ears,  foreheads 
and  noses  of  their  opponents.  A  hundred  of  the  foremost  of  the 
monkeys  leapt  on  every  titan  like  birds  on  a  felled  tree  and  the 
titans,  like  unto  hills,  struck  the  redoubtable  monkeys  with 
heavy  maces,  javelins,  scimitars  and  axes.  Cut  to  pieces  by  their 
foes,  the  great  army  of  monkeys  sought  shelter  with  Rama,  the 
son  of  Dasaratha,  the  only  true  refuge. 

Then  that  exceedingly  energetic  hero,  taking  up  his  bow, 
penetrating  into  the  ranks  of  the  titans,  overwhelmed  them  with 
a  hail  of  darts,  and  when  he  entered  their  lines,  like  unto  the  sun 
entering  the  clouds,  those  formidable  warriors,  whom  he  was 
consuming  with  the  fire  of  his  shafts,  were  unable  to  discern 
him.  And  the  titans,  beholding  the  terrible  exploits  of  that  hero 
so  disastrous  to  them,  recognized  their  author  to  be  Rama,  and 
as  the  passing  of  a  hurricane  through  a  forest  becomes  patent,  so, 
when  innumerable  battalions  were  overthrown  and  great  cars 
overturned,  they  perceived  it  to  be  his  work.  And  they  beheld 
their  army  decimated  by  arrows,  battered  and  crushed  by  his 
shafts  but,  so  rapid  were  his  movements,  that  they  could  not 
see  Rama  and  they  were  no  more  able  to  discern  Raghava  than 
beings  distinguish  the  soul  that  governs  the  senses. 

*73 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"There  is  the  one  who  is  exterminating  our  cohorts  of 
elephants  !  "  "  There  is  he,  who  with  his  sharp  arrows  is 
destroying  cavalry  and  infantry  !  " 

Speaking  thus,  the  titans,  taking  each  other  to  be  Rama  in  the 
fight,  under  this  delusion,  slew  each  other  in  anger,  and  they  were 
not  able  to  see  the  real  Rama,  who,  nevertheless,  was  destroying 
their  army,  for  they  had  all  been  thrown  into  bewilderment  by 
the  exceedingly  mighty,  marvellous  and  powerful  Gandharva 
Weapon  !  And  sometimes  on  that  vast  battlefield,  thousands  of 
Ramas  appeared  to  the  titans  and  sometimes  they  could  only  see 
one ;  and  the  bow  of  that  hero  seemed  to  them  to  be  a  myriad 
golden  bows,  whirling  like  a  circling  torch,  while  Raghava 
himself  remained  invisible ! 

With  his  body  the  pivot,  his  strength  the  lustre,  his  arrows  the 
spokes,  his  bow  the  felly,  the  twanging  of  the  cord  and  the 
gauntlet  the  sound,  the  force  of  his  intelligence  its  radiance,  its 
splendour  the  impetus  of  his  weapon,  its  circumference  the 
circle  traced  by  Rama,  while  he  was  massacring  the  titans,  he 
resembled  the  Wheel  of  Time  in  the  eyes  of  all  beings.  And  in 
the  eighth  part  of  a  day,  Rama  with  his  naming  arrows,  single- 
handed,  exterminated  the  army  of  the  titans  who  were  able  to 
change  their  form  at  will,  which  comprised  eighteen  thousand 
great  elephants,  fourteen  thousand  cavalry  and  two  hundred 
thousand  infantry. 

Exhausted,  their  horses  slain,  their  chariots  shattered,  their 
standards  broken,  those  rangers  of  the  night,  who  had  escaped 
the  carnage,  took  refuge  in  the  City  of  Lanka. 

With  the  corpses  of  elephants,  infantry  and  horses,  the  battle- 
field resembled  the  ground  where  the  mighty  Rudra,  enraged, 
disports  himself. 

Then  Devas,  Gandharvas,  Siddhas  and  Paramarishis  cried 
out: — 

"  Well  done !    Well  done !  "  lauding  Rama's  achievement. 

And  the  magnanimous  Raghava  said  to  Sugriva  who  stood 
near  with  Jambavan  and  the  foremost  of  monkeys,  Mainda  and 
Dvivida : — 

"  The  power  to  wield  this  terrible  weapon  belongs  to  me  and 
Tryambaka1  alone ! "

Having  destroyed  the  army  of  the  King  of  the  Titans,  Rama, 
the  equal  of  the  magnanimous  Shakra,  who  amidst  darts  and 
arrows  transcended  all  fatigue,  received  the  delighted  homage  of 
the  Celestial  Host. 


chapter   95 

The  Lamentations  of  the  Titan  Women 

All  those  thousands  of  elephants  and  horses  and  those  mounted 
upon  them  with  the  myriad  chariots  bright  as  tire  and  their 
flaming  banners,  as  also  the  innumerable  titans  who  were  full  of 
valour,  able  to  change  their  form  at  will,  armed  with  maces  and 
axes  and  wonderful  golden  pennants,  fell  under  the  fiery  darts, 
decorated  with  fine  gold,  of  Rama  of  imperishable  exploits. 

Beholding  this  and  hearing  those  tidings,  the  rangers  of  the 
night,  who  had  escaped  the  carnage,  were  filled  with  terror  and 
those  wretched  titans  were  united  in  a  common  misfortune. 

The  female  titans  and  those  who  had  lost  their  sons  and 
kinsfolk,  overwhelmed  with  affliction,  assembled  to  wail  and 
lament,  crying : — 

"  How  did  Shurpanakha,  who  was  old,  hideous  and  of  sunken 
belly,  dare  to  approach  Rama  in  the  forest,  he  who  was  the  equal 
of  Kandarpa  himself?  Seeing  that  handsome  youth,  full  of 
nobility,  ever  engaged  in  the  welfare  of  all  beings,  that  monstrous 
Rakshasi,  who  should  have  been  slain  by  others,  was  overpowered 
by  lust.  How  could  she,  who  was  devoid  of  all  good  qualities, 
dare  to  make  love  to  the  all-powerful  Rama  who  is  possessed  of 
comely  features  and  endowed  with  every  virtue?  To  the 
detriment  of  her  own  race,  despite  her  grey  hair  and  wrinkles, 
through  a  ridiculous  infatuation  condemned  by  all,  that  hideous 
creature  pursued  Raghava  with  her  importunities  to  the 
destruction  of  the  Titans,  Dushana  and  Khara. 

"  It  was  on  her  account  that  Ravana  committed  this  offence, 
the  fatal  bearing  away  of  Sita,  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  and  has 
provoked  the  emnity  of  the  implacable  and  powerful  Raghava. 

"  When  the  Demon  Viradha  sought  to  possess  Vaidehi,  he  fell 
before  her  under  Rama's  blows;  this  example  should  have 
*75 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

proved  sufficient !  And  fourteen  thousand  titans  of  terrible 
deeds  were  cut  down  in  Janasthana  by  Rama's  shafts  resembling 
flaming  torches,  whilst,  in  the  fight,  Khara  was  also  slain  with 
Dushana  and  Trishiras  by  his  darts  that  glittered  like  the  sun ; 
this  too  should  have  been  sufficient  to  prove  his  prowess  1 

"  Kabandha  too,  with  his  arms  four  miles  in  length,  who  lived 
on  blood,  was  slain  despite  his  fury  and  screams ;  this  too  was  a 
manifestation  of  Rama's  might.  He  slew  the  powerful  son  of 
that  God  of  a  Thousand  Eyes,  the  mighty  Bali  who  was  as  dark 
as  a  cloud,  this  too  proved  his  valour  !  And  Sugriva,  who  dwelt 
disconsolate  on  Rishyamukha,  the  vehicle  of  his  hopes  shattered, 
was  restored  to  the  throne  by  Rama,  which  was  a  further  proof 
of  bis  power. 

"All  the  titans  counselled  Ravana  to  his  advantage,  and 
Bibishana,  in  accord  with  his  duty,  offered  him  good  advice  in 
reasonable  words  but,  in  his  folly,  that  monarch  disregarded 
them.  If  the  younger  brother  of  Dhanada  had  given  ear  to 
Bibishana,  Lanka,  which  has  now  become  a  cemetery,  would 
not  have  been  laid  waste. 

"  When  he  learnt  that  the  mighty  Kumbhakarna  had  been 
slain  by  Raghava  and  that  the  invincible  Atikaya  had  fallen  under 
Lakshmana's  blows,  as  also  Indrajita,  his  beloved  son,  still 
Ravana  remained  blind  to  the  truth ! 

"  '  My  son,  my  brother,  my  lord  has  perished  in  the  fight '  is 
the  cry  heard  from  the  female  titans  in  every  family.  Chariots, 
horses  and  elephants  have  been  struck  down  in  their  thousands 
by  the  mighty  Rama  and  are  lying  here  and  there  with  the  foot 
soldiers  whom  he  has  also  slain.  He  who  is  destroying  us  is 
Rudra  or  Vishnu  or  Mahendra  or  the  God  of  a  Hundred  Sacri- 
fices, in  the  form  of  Rama,  unless  he  be  the  God  of  Death 
himself !  We  live  bereft  of  hope ;  our  warriors  slain  by  Rama ; 
we  see  no  end  to  our  fears  and  we  lament  the  loss  of  our  defenders, 

"  On  account  of  the  great  boons  he  has  received,  Dashagriva 
seems  unaware  of  the  appalling  peril  that  races  him  at  the  hands 
of  Rama.  Neither  Devas,  Gandharvas,  Pisachas  or  Rakshasas 
will  be  able  to  rescue  him  when  he  falls  into  Rama's  power. 
Each  time  Ravana  has  entered  the  lists  against  Rama,  inauspici- 
ous omens  have  appeared  foretelling  his  destruction ! 

"  When  the  Grandsire  of  the  World  was  gratified  with  him., 
376 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

he  received  immunity  from  Dcvas,  Danavas  and  Rakshasas  but 
he  did  not  ask  to  be  protected  from  man.  Here  without  doubt  is 
one  of  those  who  will  prove  fatal  to  the  titans  and  Ravana. 

"  Oppressed  by  that  titan,  who  was  filled  with  arrogance  on 
account  of  the  boon  he  had  obtained  through  his  severe  penances, 
the  Vibudhas  took  refuge  with  Brahma  and,  in  order  to  be  of 
service  to  them,  the  magnanimous  Grandsire  of  the  World 
uttered  these  memorable  words  : — 

"  '  From  to-day  the  Danavas  and  Rakshasas  shall  not  cease  to 
wander  through  the  Three  Worlds  harried  by  constant  fear !  * 

"  Meantime  the  Gods  with  Indra  at  their  head  approached  the 
Destroyer  of  Tripura,  the  God  whose  vehicle  is  the  bull,  who 
received  them  favourably  and,  being  gratified,  Mahadeva  said 
to  them : — 

" '  For  your  salvation,  a  woman  will  be  born  who  will  bring 
about  the  destruction  of  the  titans  1  This  woman,  whom  the 
Gods  will  employ,  as  formerly  hunger  was  used  to  wipe  out  the 
Danavas,  will  be  the  destroyer  of  the  titans  and  Ravana  .'  By 
bearing  Sita  away  in  his  perversity  and  misconduct,  Ravana  has 
dug  a  fearful  abyss  in  which  all  will  be  engulfed!  Who  is  there 
in  the  world  who  can  rescue  us  ?  We  have  fallen  into  Raghava's 
hands,  who  is  the  equal  of  Time,  the  Destroyer  of  the  Worlds  ! 

"As  elephants  (that  are)  trapped  in  a  blazing  forest,  there  is  no 
refuge  for  us  in  this  extreme  peril !  The  magnanimous  Bibi- 
shana  chose  the  fitting  moment  to  take  refuge  with  him  from 
whom  he  foresaw  the  danger  was  to  come." 

Thus  did  the  consorts  of  those  rangers  of  the  night  lament  with 
piercing  cries,  in  despair,  plunged  in  grief  and  terror,  their 
arms  interlaced. 


CHAPTER    96 

Ravana  goes  out  to  fight  and  encounters  ill  Omens 

From  every  dwelling  in  Lanka  the  piercing  cries  emitted  by  the 
female  titans  and  their  heart-rending  lamentations  reached 
Ravana's  ears  and,  sighing  for  a  long  time,  that  fierce-eyed 
monarch  reflected  awhile  and  thereafter  fell  into  a  great  rage. 
t  277 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Biting  his  lips,  his  eyes  red  with  anger  so  that  the  titans 
themselves  were  not  able  to  endure  bis  aspect,  he  resembled  the 
Fire  of  Dissolution  itself.  In  a  voice  choking  with  fury,  he 
issued  the  following  orders  to  the  titans  who  stood  near,  con- 
suming them  with  his  glance,  as  it  were,  and  said : — 

"  Do  you  summon  Mahodara,  Mahaparshwa  and  Virupaksha 
speedily  and  let  troops  go  forth  into  battle  at  my  command." 

At  these  words,  in  accord  with  the  king's  command,  the  titans, 
in  fear,  called  the  warriors  together  and  those  titans  of  formidable 
aspect  unanimously  cried  : — "  Let  it  be  so  !  "  and  having  per- 
formed many  benedictory  rites  and  paid  obeisance  to  Ravana, 
those  mighty  car-warriors  all  bowed  down  with  joined  palms  to 
their  master,  whose  victory  they  desired,  and  set  out  towards 
the  battlefield. 

Then  Ravana,  agitated  with  fury,  with  a  sneering  laugh,  said : — 

"  To-day  with  my  shafts,  loosed  from  the  bow  resembling  the 
sun  at  the  end  of  the  world-cycle,  I  shall  send  Raghava  and 
Lakshmana  to  the  abode  of  Yama  !  By  the  death  of  our  foes,  I 
shall  avenge  Khara,  Kumbhakarna,  Frahasta  and  Indrajita  this 
day! 

"  Neither  space  nor  the  cardinal  points  nor  heaven  nor  the  seas 
themselves  will  be  visible  under  the  cloud  of  shafts  with  which  I 
shall  cover  them.  To-day  with  my  bow  I  shall  cut  the  foremost 
of  the  monkey  battalions  to  pieces  with  a  succession  of  my 
plumed  darts.  To-day  from  the  height  of  my  chariot,  swift  as 
the  wind,  I  shall  submerge  the  simian  army  under  the  rolling 
waves  of  mine  arrows  with  the  aid  of  my  bow  in  the  guise  of  the 
ocean.  This  day  I  shall  be  the  elephant  who  tramples  under  his 
feet  those  divisions  resembling  lakes,  with  open  lotuses  the 
faces,  the  glistening  stamens  the  bodies  !  This  day,  with  each 
arrow  loosed  in  the  battle,  I  shall  pierce  the  monkey  forces  in 
their  hundreds,  as  they  fight  furiously  with  trees.  By  slaying 
mine  adversary  to-day,  I  shall  dry  the  tears  of  all  those  who  have 
lost  their  brothers  or  whose  sons  have  perished.  To-day, 
pierced  by  my  shafts,  so  large  a  number  of  monkeys  will  lie 
scattered  here  and  there  that,  through  my  prowess  one  will  not 
be  able  to  discern  the  earth's  surface !  To-day  the  crows, 
vultures  and  beasts  of  prey  will  be  sated  by  the  flesh  of  the  foe 
struck  down  by  my  darts.

YUDDHA    KANDA 

"  Let  my  chariot  be  yoked  with  all  speed  and  let  my  bow  be 
brought  immediately ;  let  those  rangers  of  the  night,  who  are 
still  here,  follow  me  into  battle !  " 

At  this  command,  Mahaparshwa  gave  his  orders  to  the  army 
leaders,  who  were  present,  saying : — 

"  Hasten  to  assemble  the  troops ! "  On  this,  the  leaders 
summoned  the  titans,  going  from  house  to  house,  making  the 
entire  circuit  of  Lanka  at  a  rapid  pace.  Instandy  all  the  titans  of 
grim  aspect  ran  out  with  a  formidable  clamour,  carrying  every 
kind  of  weapon  in  their  hands.  Swords,  lances,  clubs,  maces, 
hammers,  Halas,  spears  with  sharp  points,  huge  Kutamudgaras, 
harpoons  of  every  kind,  discus,  pointed  Parashvas,  Bhindipalas, 
Shataghnis  and  various  other  arms.  Thereafter  four  officers 
under  his  command,  brought  a  hundred  thousand  chariots  to 
Ravana  and  three  hundred  thousand  elephants,  sixty  kotis  of 
horses,  mules  and  buffalo  and  innumerable  foot  soldiers,  all 
hastening  there  at  the  king's  command. 

Whilst  the  leaders  rallied  the  forces  who  were  to  be  found  in 
the  city,  the  sovereign's  driver  prepared  his  chariot ;  and  it  was 
superbly  furnished  with  celestial  weapons  and  embellished  with 
every  kind  of  ornament,  filled  with  various  arms,  adorned  with 
rows  of  bells,  encrusted  with  pearls,  blazing  with  its  jewelled 
pillars  and  covered  with  thousands  of  golden  pinnacles. 

Beholding  it,  all  the  titans  were  seized  with  exceeding  admira- 
tion and,  perceiving  it,  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans  ascended 
thereon  and  mounted  that  car  glittering  like  a  myriad  suns, 
blazing  like  fire  itself,  and  effulgent  with  its  own  lustre.  Then 
Ravana  drove  away  immediately  surrounded  by  innumerable 
titans,  bearing  down  the  earth  as  it  were  with  the  weight  of  his 
forces ;  and,  amongst  the  titans  on  all  sides,  there  was  a  great 
din  of  shouting  and  shrilling  of  pipes  accompanied  by  tabors, 
war  drums  and  conches. 

"  There  goes  the  King  of  the  Titans  with  his  fan  and  canopy, 
the  abductor  of  Sita,  the  ruthless  slayer  of  brahmins,  that  thorn 
in  the  side  of  the  Gods,  who  is  setting  forth  to  fight  the  Prince 
of  the  House  of  Raghu ! "  Such  were  the  cries  heard  on  all 
sides  and,  at  the  uproar,  the  earth  trembled  whilst  the  monkeys 
fled  in  terror. 

Meanwhile,  the  long-armed  Ravana,  surrounded  by  his 
279 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

ministers,  marched  on,  full  of  the  ardour  of  combat  and  certain 
of  victory.  At  his  command  Mahaparshwa,  Mahodara  and  the 
indomitable  Virupaksha  ascended  their  chariots  and  these 
warriors,  in  their  delight,  emitted  war  cries  loud  enough  to 
shatter  the  earth  and,  with  formidable  shouts,  they  set  out  eager 
for  victory. 

The  highly  effulgent  monarch,  surrounded  by  his  valiant 
battalions,  rushed  into  battle,  brandishing  his  bow,  like  Yama  at 
the  dissolution  of  the  world,  and  that  great  warrior,  mounted  on 
his  car  harnessed  to  swift  steeds  set  out  through  the  gate  where 
Rama  and  Lakshmana  were  encamped.  At  that  moment  the 
sun  lost  its  brilliance,  the  quarters  were  enveloped  in  darkness, 
the  birds  emitted  dreadful  cries,  the  earth  trembled,  the  Gods 
let  fall  a  rain  of  blood  and  Ravana's  horses  stumbled,  whilst  a 
vulture  alighted  on  the  pole  of  his  banner  and  sinister  jackals 
howled.  Then  that  titan  felt  his  left  eye  twitch  and  tremors  pass 
through  his  left  arm ;  he  grew  pale  and  his  voice  seemed  to 
die  away.  As  Dashagriva  set  forth  to  fight,  ill  omens  appeared 
presaging  his  death  ;  a  meteor  fell  from  the  sky  with  the  crash 
of  thunder  and  herons  and  vultures  emitted  mournful  cries. 
Ravana,  however,  remained  unmoved  by  the  terrible  portents 
that  appeared  and  rushed  madly  to  his  doom,  urged  on  by 
destiny. 

At  the  sound  of  the  titan  chariots,  the  rakshasa  host  and  the 
monkey  army  also  prepared  to  give  battle  and  from  every  side, 
impatient  for  victory,  challenged  one  another. 

Meanwhile,  in  his  ire,  Dashagriva  with  his  golden  shafts, 
created  havoc  among  the  monkeys  and  some  among  those 
heroic  warriors  had  their  heads  severed  by  him  and  the  hearts  of 
others  were  pierced  or  their  ears  cut  off  and  some  fell  lifeless, 
the  flanks  of  others  being  torn,  their  heads  broken  or  their  eyes 
put  out.  Whenever  the  ten-headed  titan,  rolling  his  eyes 
furiously,  turned  his  chariot  in  the  fight,  the  ferocity  of  his 
assault  was  irresistible  to  the  leaders  of  his  foes.

CHAPTER    97 

The  Fight  between  Virupaksha  and  Sugriva.   Virupaksha's  Death 

The  mutilated  corpses  of  the  monkeys,  who  had  fallen  under  the 
shafts  of  Dashagriva  were  heaped  on  the  earth,  and  the  Plavam- 
gamas  were  as  unable  to  endure  that  irresistible  avalanche  of 
darts  loosed  by  Ravana,  as  butterflies  a  scorching  fire.  Tormented 
by  those  sharp  arrows,  they  fled  screaming  like  elephants 
enveloped  in  flames  and  Ravana  advanced  in  the  fight  scattering 
them  with  his  darts  as  the  wind  disperses  the  clouds. 

Having,  in  his  fury,  exterminated  those  inhabitants  of  the 
woods,  that  Indra  among  the  Titans  rushed  on  to  find  Raghava. 
Then  Sugriva,  seeing  the  monkeys  cut  to  pieces  and  routed,  gave 
over  his  position  to  Sushena  and  addressed  himself  for  battle. 
Relinquishing  his  command  to  that  monkey,  who  was  his  equal  in 
valour,  Sugriva  went  out  to  meet  the  enemy,  a  tree  in  his  hand. 
At  his  side  and  following  in  his  footsteps  marched  all  the  monkey 
leaders  brandishing  enormous  rocks  and  every  kind  of  tree. 

Thereafter  that  royal  giant  let  forth  a  great  shout  and  fell  on 
that  mob  of  titans,  destroying  their  leaders,  and  that  mighty 
monarch  crushed  the  titan  divisions,  as  at  the  end  of  the  world 
cycle  the  wind  breaks  down  the  great  trees ;  and  he  let  fall  a 
shower  of  stones  on  the  titan  divisions  like  a  huge  cloud  letting 
loose  hailstones  amidst  a  flock  of  birds  in  a  wood.  Under  the 
avalanche  of  stones  loosed  by  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  the 
titans,  their  heads  shorn  of  their  ears,  fell  like  crumbling  mount- 
ains, and  whilst  the  titans  were  being  overthrown  by  Sugriva,  who 
was  crushing  them  as  they  fell,  they  cried  out.  Then  Virupaksha, 
armed  with  his  bow,  proclaiming  his  name,  leapt  down  from  his 
chariot  and  that  indomitable  titan  mounted  an  elephant  and, 
advancing  thereon,  and  he,  full  of  vigour,  let  forth  a  terrible 
cry  and  hurled  himself  on  the  monkeys.  Thereafter  he  rained  a 
shower  of  formidable  darts  on  Sugriva  in  the  forefront  of  battle 
and  arrested  the  rout  of  the  titans  by  reviving  their  courage. 

Riddled  with  wounds  from  the  sharp  arrows  of  the  titans,  that 
Indra  of  Monkeys,  howling  with  rage,  resolved  to  slay  him  and, 
281 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

brandishing  a  tree,  that  valiant  and  indomitable  monkey  leapt 
forward  and  struck  the  huge  head  of  his  adversary's  elephant,  and 
under  the  virulence  of  that  blow,  the  great  tusker  sank  down 
emitting  loud  cries. 

Then  the  courageous  titan  jumped  down  from  the  back  of  the 
stunned  beast  and,  turning  on  the  monkey,  threw  himself  upon 
him,  but  he,  clad  in  mail  covered  with  the  hide  of  a  bull,  un- 
sheathing his  sword,  with  a  rapid  step,  rushed  defiantly  on 
Sugriva  who  stood  fast,  waiting.  Then  Sugriva  met  the  impact 
of  Virupaksha  and  thereafter  let  fly  a  great  rock  like  unto  a 
cloud,  whereupon  that  lion  among  the  titans,  seeing  the  stone 
falling,  jumped  aside  and,  full  of  valour,  struck  the  monkey  with 
his  sword.  Pierced  by  the  valiant  titan's  sword,  the  monkey  lay 
on  the  ground  for  a  time  deprived  of  consciousness,  then, 
suddenly  rising  to  his  feet  in  the  great  struggle,  he  whirled  his  fist 
round  and  round,  bringing  it  down  violently  on  the  titan's  chest. 

Wounded  by  his  blows,  the  night-ranger,  enraged,  with  his 
sword  severed  Sugriva's  armour  in  the  forefront  of  battle  and, 
under  the  shock,  he  fell  to  his  knees.  Thereupon  the  monkey, 
picking  himself  up,  gave  the  titan  a  terrific  blow  that  resounded 
like  thunder,  but  Virupaksha  evaded  it  skilfully  and,  with  his 
fist,  struck  Sugriva  on  the  chest. 

Thereafter  the  monkey  king  waxed  even  more  furious  and, 
seeing  that  the  titan  had  parried  his  thrust,  sought  an  opportunity 
to  attack  him.  In  bis  rage,  he  struck  him  a  violent  blow  on  the 
temple  like  unto  Indra's  thunderbolt  which  felled  him  to  the 
earth,  and  the  blood  flowed  from  his  mouth  covering  him  like 
water  from  a  mountain  torrent.  Rolling  his  eyes  in  fury, 
foaming  at  the  mouth  and  bathed  in  blood,  he  seemed  more 
misshapen1  than  ever  and  the  monkeys  beheld  their  enemy 
covered  with  blood,  trembling,  and  rolling  from  side  to  side, 
emitting  plaintive  cries. 

Meanwhile  the  two  valiant  armies  of  monkeys  and  titans,  who 
were  fighting  one  another,  began  to  create  a  terrible  uproar  like 
two  seas  that  had  burst  their  banks. 

In  the  presence  of  the  all-powerful  titan,  who  had  been  slain 
by  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  the  varied  multitude  of  monkeys 
and  titans  resembled  the  Ganges  in  flood.

Makodara  is  slain  by  Sugriva 

In  that  fearful  struggle,  both  armies  gradually  melted  away  under 
each  others'  blows  like  two  lakes  drying  up  under  the  summer 
heat.  The  destruction  of  his  forces  and  the  death  of  Virupaksha 
redoubled  the  fury  of  the  Lord  of  the  Titans.  Seeing  his  army 
decimated  and  destroyed  by  the  monkeys,  he  recognized  that 
destiny  was  opposing  him  and  he  became  apprehensive. 

Thereafter  he  addressed  Mahodara,  who  stood  near  him, 
saying : — "  From  now  on,  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  thou  art  my 
only  hope  of  victory !  Go,  triumph  over  the  enemy  forces ! 
Display  thy  heroism  to-day ;  the  time  has  come  to  return  the 
favours  thy  master  has  bestowed  on  thee  !    Fight  bravely  !  " 

At  these  words,  that  foremost  of  titans,  Mahodara  replied : — 
"  Be  it  so  !  "  and  rushed  on  the  enemy's  army  as  a  butterfly  into 
a  flame.  Then  that  exceedingly  powerful  titan,  whose  ardour 
had  been  stimulated  by  the  words  of  his  master  and  also  on 
account  of  his  own  native  valour,  began  to  create  carnage  among 
the  monkeys. 

From  their  side,  the  noble-hearted  monkeys,  arming  them- 
selves with  enormous  stones,  penetrated  into  the  ranks  of  the 
redoubtable  titans  and  slew  them  all.  And  Mahodara,  at  the 
height  of  fury,  with  his  golden  shafts  severed  the  hands,  feet 
and  thighs  of  the  monkeys  in  the  great  struggle  and  they,  after  a 
hard  fight  with  the  titans,  fled  to  different  quarters,  some  taking 
refuge  with  Sugriva. 

Witnessing  the  rout  of  his  powerful  army,  Sugriva  rushed 
upon  Mahodara  and  the  Lord  of  the  Monkeys,  seizing  a  huge  and 
formidable  rock  resembling  a  hill,  threw  it  at  him  with  great 
force,  in  order  to  crush  him. 

Seeing  the  stone  falling,  Mahodara,  unmoved,  cut  it  to  pieces 
with  his  arrows.  Under  the  titan's  darts,  it  fell  in  a  thousand 
fragments  on  the  earth  so  that  it  resembled  a  flock  of  frightened 
vultures.  Beholding  that  rock  broken,  Sugriva,  mad  with  anger, 
tore  up  a  Sala  Tree  and  flung  it  at  his  adversary,  who  broke  it  into 
283 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

many  pieces.  With  his  shafts,  that  hero,  the  scourge  of  his  toes, 
broke  the  tree,  whereupon  Sugriva,  observing  an  iron  stake 
lying  on  the  ground,  brandished  the  flash  ng  bar  before  the  eyes 
of  the  titan  and,  with  one  exceedingly  violent  blow,  struck  down 
his  excellent  steeds. 

Leaping  down  from  his  great  car,  its  team  of  horses  having 
been  slain,  the  valiant  Mahodara,  highly  provoked,  took  hold  of 
a  mace  and  the  two  warriors,  one  armed  with  an  iron  bar  and  the 
other  with  a  mace,  approached  each  other,  bellowing  like  bulls, 
resembling  two  clouds  charged  with  lightning.  In  fury,  the 
night-ranger,  his  lustrous  mace  glittering  like  the  sun,  rushed  on 
Sugriva  and,  as  the  terrible  club  was  falling  upon  him,  the 
extremely  valiant  leader  of  the  monkeys,  his  eyes  red  with 
anger,  lifted  up  his  weapon  and  struck,  whereupon  the  bar 
instantly  fell  shattered  to  the  earth.  Then  Sugriva,  boiling  with 
rage,  from  the  ground  picked  up  a  huge  club  gilded  on  all  sides 
and,  brandishing  it,  hurled  it  against  the  mace,  striking  it, 
whereupon,  on  the  impact,  the  two  missiles  broke  in  pieces  and 
fell  on  the  field. 

Their  weapons  shattered,  the  two  warriors  attacked  each  other 
with  blows  of  their  fists  and,  full  of  ardour  and  strength,  re- 
sembled two  lit  braziers.  Amidst  loud  cries,  they  struck  each 
other  and,  having  interchanged  blows,  rolled  on  the  earth. 
Leaping  up  immediately,  the  two  pugilists,  great  champions, 
scourgers  of  their  foes,  exhausted  each  other,  whereupon  each 
seized  hold  of  a  sword  that  lay  within  reach  and,  transported 
with  rage,  threw  themselves  upon  each  other,  their  weapons 
upraised.  Then  those  two  spirited  and  experienced  warriors 
moved  rapidly  from  left  to  right  of  one  another,  each  seeking  to 
slay  his  opponent.  Meantime  the  courageous,  impetuous  and 
wicked  Mahodara,  proud  of  his  strength,  pierced  Sugriva's 
heavy  mail  with  his  sword  whereupon  the  weapon  snapped  on 
the  impact.  Then  that  elephant  among  monkeys,  with  his  own 
sword,  severed  the  titan's  head  bearing  a  helmet  and  adorned 
with  earrings. 

Beholding  their  leader  lying  headless  on  the  ground,  the  whole 
army  of  titans  melted  away  and,  having  slain  Mahodara,  the 
monkey  with  his  forces  began  to  cheer,  whereupon  Dashagriva 
grew  furious  and  Raghava  was  filled  with  joy. 
284

With  downcast  mien,  the  titans,  overwhelmed,  all  fled  away 
mad  with  terror,  but  the  son  of  Surya,1  having  laid  Mahodara 
low,  who  resembled  part  of  a  great  mountain,  shone  with 
effulgence  like  that  orb  itself  with  its  inextinguishable  brilliance. 
And  the  hosts  of  the  Gods,  Siddhas,  Yakshas  and  also  the  beings 
who  move  on  the  surface  of  the  earth,  gazed  with  great  delight 
on  the  King  of  the  Monkeys,  who  had  achieved  that  supreme 
victory. 


chapter   99 

The  Combat  between  Angada  and  Mahaparshwa 

Mahodara  having  been  struck  down  by  Sugriva,  the  all-powerful 
Mahaparshwa  gazed  on  his  slayer,  his  eyes  red  with  anger  and, 
with  his  shafts,  began  to  sow  disorder  in  AngadVs  formidable 
ranks ;  and  as  the  wind  detaches  a  fruit  from  its  stalk  so  did 
that  titan  sever  the  upper  limbs  of  the  leading  monkeys.  With 
his  darts,  he  cut  off  the  arms  of  some  and,  full  of  ire,  pierced  the 
sides  of  others.  Overwhelmed  by  those  shafts,  that  Mahaparshwa 
loosed  upon  them,  the  monkeys  grew  pale  with  fright  and  lost 
courage. 

Then  Angada,  wishing  to  give  a  little  respite  to  his  troops,  who 
had  been  trampled  upon  and  decimated  by  that  titan,  leapt  up 
full  of  fury  like  the  ocean  on  the  day  of  the  full  tide.  Seizing  an 
iron  bar  that  shone  like  the  rays  of  the  sun,  that  Prince  of  the 
Monkeys  struck  Mahaparshwa  in  the  struggle  and  he,  losing 
consciousness,  fell  from  his  chariot,  its  driver  having  been  slain, 
and  lay  senseless  on  the  earth. 

Thereupon  the  mighty  King  of  the  Bears  who  resembled  a 
heap  of  black  antimony  and  was  extremely  powerful,  arming 
himself  with  a  huge  rock  like  unto  the  peak  of  a  mountain,  strode 
ahead  of  his  battalion,  which  resembled  a  cloud,  and  with  a 
furious  blow  struck  down  the  horses  and  shattered  the  chariot  of 
the  titan. 

Mahaparshwa,  however,  regaining  consciousness,  leapt  up  in 
an  instant  and,  in  his  great  vigour,  riddled  Angada  with 
1  Sugriva. 

285 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

innumerable  arrows  again  and  again  and  struck  Jambavan,  the 
King  of  the  Bears  with  three  spears  full  in  the  chest,  wounding 
Gavaksha  with  innumerable  shafts.  Thereafter  Angada,  who 
was  transported  with  rage,  seized  hold  of  an  enormous  stake  and 
with  that  iron  bar,  bright  as  the  rays  of  the  sun,  the  son  of  Bali, 
his  eyes  red  with  anger,  taking  hold  of  it  with  both  hands  and 
brandishing  it  with  force,  with  the  intention  of  slaying  him, 
hurled  it  on  Mahaparshwa,  who  stood  some  distance  off. 

Thrown  with  force,  the  bar  knocked  the  bow  with  its  arrows 
from  the  hand  of  the  titan  and  struck  off  his  helmet,  whereupon 
Angada,  with  a  single  bound,  seething  with  rage,  struck  the  titan 
a  blow  with  his  clenched  fist  on  the  ear,  which  was  adorned  with 
an  earring. 

Enraged,  the  valiant  and  illustrious  Mahaparshwa  seized  hold 
of  a  great  axe  in  one  hand  and  with  that  stainless  weapon  washed 
in  oil,  made  of  solid  stone,  that  titan,  in  a  paroxysm  of  fury, 
struck  his  antagonist  violently,  but  the  blow,  falling  on  the  left 
shoulder,  glanced  off  his  armour.  Then  Angada,  the  equal  of  his 
sire  in  valour,  furious,  lifted  up  his  fist  which  was  as  powerful  as 
lightning  and  knowing  the  vital  parts  of  the  body,  delivered  a 
blow  like  unto  Indra's  thunderbolt  on  the  chest  of  the  titan, 
close  to  his  heart. 

On  this  the  titan,  his  heart  riven  by  the  shock,  fell  dead  on  that 
vast  battlefield,  and  seeing  him  lying  stretched  on  the  earth 
without  life,  his  army  took  fright,  whilst  Ravana  fell  into  a 
transport  of  rage. 

Thereafter  the  monkeys  with  Angada,  let  forth  a  joyous 
roaring  that  resounded  far  and  wide,  shattering  the  gates  and 
turrets  of  Lanka  as  it  were.  The  Gods  too  with  their  king  let 
forth  a  great  shout  and  that  enemy  of  Indra,  the  Lord  of  the 
Titans,  enraged  on  hearing  the  immense  uproar  among  the 
inhabitants  of  the  Celestial  Regions  and  the  forests,  resolved  to 
enter  into  the  lists  once  more.

CHAPTER    100 

Rama  and  Havana  fight  toith  magic  Weapons 

Beholding  Mahodara  and  Mahaparshwa  slain  and,  despite  his 
great  strength,  the  valiant  Virupaksha  also  struck  down,  a  great  rage 
seized  Ravana,  who  urged  on  his  charioteer  with  these  words: — 

"  By  slaying  Rama  and  Lakshmana  I  shall  remove  that  double 
scourge,  the  cause  of  the  slaughter  of  my  faithful  adherents  and 
the  siege  of  the  city.  In  the  fight  I  shall  cut  down  Rama,  that 
tree  of  which  Sita  is  the  flower  and  the  fruit,  whose  branches  are 
Sugriva,  Jambavan,  Kumuda,  Nala,  also  Dvivida,  Mainda, 
Angada,  Gandhamadana,  Hanuman,  Sushena  and  all  the  leading 
monkeys." 

Thereupon  that  mighty  car-warrior,  who  caused  the  ten 
regions  to  resound,  drove  rapidly  on  Raghava  with  his  chariot, 
and  the  earth,  with  its  rivers,  mountains  and  woods,  trembled 
with  the  uproar,  and  the  lions,  gazelles  and  birds  that  inhabited 
it  were  seized  with  terror. 

Then  Ravana  employed  a  dark  and  magic  weapon  that  was 
formidable  and  terrifying  and  with  it  he  consumed  the  monkeys, 
who  fled  hither  and  thither.  Amidst  the  dust  raised  by  their 
battalions,  for  they  were  unable  to  endure  that  weapon  created 
by  Brahma  himself,  Raghava,  seeing  those  countless  divisions 
taking  refuge  in  innumerable  places,  pursued  by  Havana's 
powerful  shafts,  stood  ready  waiting. 

Meanwhile  that  Tiger  among  the  Titans,  having  routed  the 
army  of  monkeys,  beheld  Rama  standing  there  unconquered 
with  his  brother  Lakshmana,  like  unto  Vasava  with  Vishnu,  and 
Rama  seemed  to  touch  the  sky  as  it  were  as  he  stretched  his  great 
bow  and  those  heroes  with  eyes  as  large  as  lotus  petals  were 
long-armed  and  the  conquerors  of  their  foes. 

From  his  side  the  extremely  illustrious  and  valiant  Rama,  who 
was  accompanied  by  Saumitri,  seeing  Ravana  overwhelming  the 
monkeys  in  the  fight,  joyfully  took  hold  of  the  centre  of  his  bow 
and  immediately  began  to  bend  that  excellent  weapon  that  was 
stout  and  sonorous,  riving  the  earth  as  it  were. 
287 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

At  die  sound  of  Havana's  loosing  a  myriad  arrows  and  Rama 
stretching  his  bow,  the  titans  fell  to  the  ground  in  their  hundreds! 
Thereafter  Havana,  coming  within  a  bow's  length  of  the  two 
princes,  resembled  Rahu  in  the  presence  of  the  sun  and  moon. 
Desiring  to  be  the  first  to  enter  into  combat,  Lakshmana  with 
his  sharp  arrows,  having  placed  them  on  his  bow,  loosed  his 
shafts  resembling  flames  of  fire.  Hardly  had  that  archer  let  fly 
his  darts  into  the  air  than  the  extremely  energetic  Ravana  stayed 
them  in  their  course,  severing  one  with  one,  three  with  three  and 
ten  with  ten,  thus  demonstrating  his  lightness  of  hand.  Leaping 
over  Saumitri,  that  triumphant  warrior,  Ravana  approached 
Rama  in  the  conflict,  who  stood  ready  like  unto  an  unscalable 
mountain.  Bearing  down  on  Raghava,  his  eyes  red  with  anger, 
the  Lord  of  the  Titans  loosed  a  rain  of  shafts  upon  him  but,  with 
the  aid  of  his  sharp  arrows,  Raghava  severed  those  innumerable 
darts  that  flamed  in  formidable  wise  and  resembled  venomous 
snakes. 

Thereafter  Raghava  struck  Ravana  with  redoubled  blows  and 
Ravana  struck  Raghava  and  they  riddled  each  other  with  a  hail 
of  varied  and  penetrating  missiles  and,  for  a  long  time,  described 
marvellous  circles  round  each  other  from  left  to  right,  over- 
whelming each  other  with  swift  arrows,  each  remaining  unde- 
feated. And  all  beings  were  seized  with  terror  witnessing  that 
desperate  duel  between  those  two  redoubtable  bowmen,  the 
equals  of  Yama  and  Antaka.  The  sky  was  covered  with  clouds 
riven  by  lightning  flashes  and  the  firmament  became,  as  it  were, 
pierced  with  holes  by  a  rain  of  whirling  arrows  of  extreme 
velocity,  possessing  sharp  points,  adorned  with  heron's  plumes. 
With  their  darts,  they  first  obscured  the  sky  as  when  the  sun 
withdraws  behind  the  Astachala  Mountains  and  two  great 
clouds  suddenly  appear. 

Thereafter,  between  those  two  warriors,  each  seeking  to  slay 
die  other,  an  incomparable  and  unimaginable  struggle  ensued 
like  unto  the  duel  between  Vritra  and  Vasava.  Both  were 
furnished  with  excellent  bows,  both  were  skilled  warriors,  both 
brought  exceptional  knowledge  in  the  science  of  arms  to  the  fight. 
In  all  their  manoeuvrings  they  were  followed  by  a  stream  of 
shafts  as  the  waves  in  two  oceans  that  are  whipped  up  by  a 
tempest. 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Then,  with  a  skilful  hand,  Ravana,  the  Destroyer  of  the 
Worlds,  aiming  at  Rama's  forehead,  loosed  a  formidable 
succession  of  iron  shafts  from  his  bow,  which  Rama  received 
unmoved  on  his  head  like  a  garland  of  lotus  leaves.  Thereupon, 
reciting  a  sacred  formula,  arming  himself  with  Rudra's  weapon 
and  choosing  a  large  number  of  spears,  full  of  wrath,  the 
illustrious  Raghava  bent  his  bow  and  with  force  let  fly  those 
weapons  in  rapid  succession  against  that  Indra  of  Titans  but 
those  darts  fell  without  breaking  through  the  armour  of  Ravana, 
who,  like  an  immense  cloud,  remained  unmoved. 

Then  Rama,  skilled  in  the  use  of  arms,  struck  Ravana  afresh 
on  the  forehead,  as  he  stood  in  bis  chariot,  with  arrows  to  which 
he  had  joined  a  miraculous  weapon,  and  it  appeared  as  if  five- 
headed  serpents  in  the  form  of  darts  were  penetrating  hissing 
into  the  earth  repelled  by  Ravana  whom  they  sought  to  devour. 
Thereupon,  having  rendered  Raghava's  weapon  void,  Ravana,  in 
a  transport  of  rage,  armed  himself  in  his  turn  with  the  dreadful 
Asura  weapon  which  he  loosed  joined  to  sharp  and  terrible  arrows 
with  huge  points,  having  the  heads  of  lions,  tigers,  herons,  geese, 
vultures,  falcons,  jackals  and  wolves  or  resembling  serpents  with 
five  heads.  Others  had  the  heads  of  donkeys,  boars,  dogs,  cocks, 
aquatic  monsters  and  venomous  reptiles  and  those  sharp  arrows 
were  the  creation  of  bis  magic  power.  Struck  by  the  Asuric 
shafts,  that  lion  among  the  Raghus,  he  who  resembled  the  God 
of  Fire  himself,  responded  with  the  Agneya  Dart  that  was  full  of 
power  and  to  it  he  joined  arrows  of  every  kind  with  points  that 
burnt  like  fire  and  which  resembled  suns,  planets  and  stars  in 
hue  or  great  meteors  like  unto  naming  tongues.  Those  for- 
midable missiles  belonging  to  Ravana  striking  against  those 
loosed  by  Rama,  disintegrated  in  space  and  were  annihilated  in 
their  thousands. 

Thereupon  all  the  valiant  monkeys  with  Sugriva  at  their  head, 
able  to  change  their  form  at  will,  beholding  the  titan's  weapon 
destroyed  by  Rama  of  imperishable  karma,  let  forth  joyous 
acclamations  and  made  a  circle  round  him. 

Then  the  magnanimous  son  of  Dasaratha,  the  descendant  of 
Raghu,  having  destroyed  that  weapon  discharged  by  Ravana's 
own  arm,  was  filled  with  felicity,  whilst  the  leaders  of  the  mon- 
keys joyfully  paid  homage  to  him. 
a*9 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     101 

Ravana  flees  from  Rama 

His  weapon  having  been  destroyed,  Ravana,  the  King  of  the 
Titans,  whose  fury  was  redoubled,  in  his  wrath  instantly 
produced  another  j  and  he  loosed  the  fearful  Rudra  Weapon, 
forged  by  Maya,  on  Raghava.  Thereafter,  from  his  bow, 
innumerable  spears,  maces,  naming  bars  hard  as  diamond, 
mallets,  hammers,  chains  and  spiked  clubs,  like  unto  fiery 
thunderbolts,  issued  forth  like  the  tempests  at  the  dissolution  of 
the  worlds. 

Then  the  glorious  Raghava,  most  skilled  in  the  knowledge  of 
excellent  shafts,  that  warrior  of  great  renown,  broke  that  weapon 
with  the  aid  of  the  marvellous  Gandharva  Dart,  and  when  it  was 
shattered  by  the  magnanimous  Raghava,  Ravana,  his  eyes  red 
with  fury,  loosed  his  Solar  Weapon  whereupon  huge  and  brilliant 
discs  issued  from  the  bow  of  the  skilful  Dashagriva  of  redoubtable 
courage,  which,  falling,  lit  up  the  sky  on  every  side  and  the  four 
quarters  were  consumed  by  the  fell  of  those  filming  missiles  that 
resembled  the  sun,  moon  and  stars. 

With  a  mass  of  arrows  Raghava  destroyed  those  discs  and  darts 
loosed  by  Ravana  in  the  fore-front  of  the  battle  and,  seeing  his 
weapon  broken,  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans  with  ten  arrows 
struck  Rama  in  his  vital  parts.  Struck  by  ten  shafts  that  Ravana 
had  discharged  from  his  great  bow,  the  exceedingly  energetic 
Raghava  did  not  flinch  and,  in  his  turn,  that  victorious  prince, 
in  the  height  of  anger,  pierced  Ravana  in  all  his  limbs  with  the 
aid  of  innumerable  darts. 

At  that  instant,  the  younger  brother  of  Raghava,  the  valiant 
Lakshmana,  slayer  of  hostile  warriors,  armed  himself  with  seven 
arrows  and,  with  those  exceedingly  swift  shafts,  that  illustrious 
prince  severed  Ravana's  standard  in  many  places,  which  bore  the 
image  of  a  man's  head.  With  a  single  arrow,  the  fortunate 
l-akshmana  of  immense  vigour,  cut  off  the  head  adorned  with 
brilliant  earrings  of  the  titan  who  drove  the  chariot,  and  with 
290 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

five  sharp  arrows  severed  the  bow  resembling  the  trunk  of  an 
elephant  that  belonged  to  the  King  of  the  Titans. 

Thereafter  Bibishana,  bounding  forward,  with  his  mace  slew 
Ravana's  beautiful  horses  that  were  as  tall  as  hills  and  resembled 
a  dark  cloud  in  hue,  whereupon  Dashagriva,  leaping  quickly 
from  his  car,  the  steeds  of  which  having  been  slain,  was  filled 
with  exceeding  wrath  against  his  brother  and  that  powerful  and 
spirited  monarch  loosed  a  flaming  spear  on  Bibishana  like  unto  a 
thunderbolt,  but  ere  it  reached  its  target,  Lakshmana  severed  it 
with  three  arrows,  whereupon  a  great  cheer  arose  amongst  the 
monkeys  in  that  formidable  struggle,  and  that  spear,  wreathed  in 
gold,  fell  down  shattered  in  three  fragments  like  unto  a  great 
meteor  falling  from  the  sky  amidst  a  shower  of  flaming 
sparks. 

Then  the  titan,  that  mighty  Ravana  of  wicked  soul,  armed 
himself  wiih  another  superior  and  tested  spear  which  Death 
himself  would  have  found  hard  to  resist  and  which  was  of 
immense  size  and  shone  with  its  own  effulgence.  Brandished 
with  violence  by  the  mighty  Ravana  of  perverse  soul  it  gave  out 
a  lurid  gleam  so  that  it  appeared  like  forked  lightning. 

Meanwhile  the  valiant  Lakshmana,  perceiving  that  Bibishana 
stood  in  peril  of  his  life,  placed  himself  quickly  in  front  of  him 
and  that  hero,  stretching  his  bow,  with  a  rain  of  darts  riddled 
Ravana,  who  stood  waiting  to  discharge  the  weapon  he  held  in 
his  hand.  Under  the  shower  of  arrows  with  which  the  courageous 
Saurnitri  overwhelmed  him,  thus  frustrating  bis  design,  the 
titan  no  longer  thought  of  striking  him  in  return.  Seeing  that  he 
had  preserved  his  brother's  life,  Ravana,  who  was  standing  before 
him,  addressed  him  thus : — 

"  O  Thou  whose  strength  renders  thee  arrogant,  since  thou 
hast  preserved  this  titan,  my  spear  shall  fall  on  thee ;  having 
pierced  thine  heart,  this  bloodstained  weapon  that  mine  arm, 
equal  to  an  iron  bar,  will  hurl  at  thee  will  rob  thee  of  thy  life's 
breath  and  return  to  my  hand." 

Thus  did  Ravana,  speak  and  in  a  paroxysm  of  rage, 
levelling  that  pick  adorned  with  eight  extremely  loud  bells, 
created  magically  by  Maya,  that  was  infallible,  the  slayer  of  its 
foes,  the  splendour  of  which  flamed  up  as  it  were,  hurled  it  at 
Takshmana  with  a  mighty  shout.  Loosed  with  terrible  violence 
291 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  a  sound  of  thunder,  that  spear  fell  with  force  on  Lakshmana 
in  the  forefront  of  the  battle. 

Then  Raghava  sought  to  mitigate  the  power  of  that  weapon 
and  said : — 

"  May  good  fortune  attend  Lakshmana  !  May  this  mortal 
impact  be  rendered  void !  " 

Released  by  the  enraged  titan  on  that  indomitable  hero,  the 
spear  which  resembled  a  venomous  snake,  falling  with  extreme 
violence,  penetrated  bis  great  chest  and  so  brilliant  was  it  that  it 
appeared  like  the  tongue  of  the  King  of  the  Serpents.  Loosed 
with  force  by  Ravana,  that  spear  penetrated  deep  into  the  body 
of  Lakshmana  who,  with  his  heart  pierced,  fell  on  the  earth. 

Beholding  Lakshmana  in  that  condition,  near  to  whom  he 
stood,  the  extremely  powerful  Raghava,  full  of  solicitude  for  his 
brother,  felt  his  heart  stricken,  but  after  an  instant's  reflection,  his 
eyes  welling  with  tears,  enraged  as  is  Pavaka  at  the  dissolution  of 
the  world,  he  thought — '  This  is  not  the  time  for  lamentation  ' 
and  thereafter  he  entered  once  more  into  the  fearful  conflict, 
resolved  to  make  a  supreme  attempt  to  slay  Ravana. 

His  eyes  fixed  on  his  brother,  Rama  saw  how  he  had  been 
pierced  with  a  spear  in  the  great  fight  and  was  covered  with 
blood,  resembling  a  mountain  with  its  reptiles.  And  the  most 
vigorous  of  monkeys  sought  to  draw  out  that  weapon  loosed  by 
the  mighty  Ravana,  overwhelmed  though  they  were  by  a  hail  of 
shafts  discharged  by  the  King  of  the  Titans ;  the  spear,  however, 
having  passed  through  Saumitri's  body  had  penetrated  into  the 
earth.  Then  Rama,  with  his  powerful  hands  seized  hold  of  that 
spear  and,  in  his  wrath,  snapped  it,  throwing  the  fragments  to  a 
great  distance  and,  as  he  drew  it  out,  Ravana  penetrated  his 
every  limb  with  his  shafts  that  pierced  to  his  very  marrow. 
Ignoring  these  darts,  Rama  embraced  Lakshmana  and  said  to 
Hanuman  and  that  mighty  Monkey  Sugriva : — 

"  Ye  foremost  of  the  monkeys,  gather  round  T^kshmnna  !  O 
King  of  the  Monkeys,  the  time  has  come  for  me  to  manifest  my 
prowess !  For  long  I  have  sought  this  occasion !  May  the 
wicked  Dashagriva  of  infamous  exploits  perish  !  My  longing 
resembles  that  of  the  Chatak  bird1  on  beholding  the  clouds  at  the 
end  of  summer.    Ere  long,  I  swear  to  thee  either  Ravana  or 

1  This  bird  is  said  only  to  quench  its  thirst  at  a  certain  season. 
29Z 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Rama  will  cease  to  exist  in  the  world !  Ye  shall  be  witness 
thereof !  The  loss  of  the  kingdom,  my  sojourn  in  the  forest  and 
my  wanderings  in  the  woods  of  Dandaka,  the  insult  offered  to 
Vaidehi,  my  encounter  with  the  titans,  the  great  and  terrible 
misfortune  that  has  visited  me,  this  torment  resembling  hell  will 
be  wiped  out  this  day  when  I  slay  Ravana  on  the  battlefield  !  He 
on  whose  account  I  took  the  army  of  monkeys  in  my  train,  having 
installed  Sugriva,  when  I  had  slain  Bali  in  the  open  field,  and  on 
whose  account  I  crossed  the  ocean,  having  thrown  a  bridge  over 
it,  that  wretch  to-day  has  come  within  my  range  of  vision  and  shall 
therefore  cease  to  live.  Appearing  before  me,  Ravana  cannot 
survive  any  more  than  one  who  comes  into  the  presence  of  a 
serpent  whose  glance  is  poisonous  or  a  snake  falling  under 
Vainateya's  gaze.  Be  tranquil  witnesses  of  my  combat  with 
Ravana,  O  Invincible  Ones,  Foremost  of  the  Monkeys ;  seat 
yourselves  on  the  brow  of  the  mountain.  To-day  in  this  duel, 
the  Three  Worlds  with  the  Gandharvas,  the  Siddhas  and 
Charanas  will  recognize  Rama's  attributes  !  I  shall  accomplish  a 
feat  that  the  world  with  all  beings  who  move  or  do  not  move,  as 
also  the  Gods,  will  recount  as  long  as  the  earth  exists !  " 

Speaking  thus  Rama  began  to  discharge  his  penetrating  shafts 
embellished  with  gold  at  Dashagriva.  From  his  side,  Ravana, 
like  a  cloud  from  which  the  rain  falls,  showered  down  arrows 
and  clubs  with  violence  on  Rama.  And  a  mighty  uproar  arose 
when,  in  order  to  slay  each  other,  those  marvellous  arrows  were 
loosed  by  Rama  and  Ravana.  Severed  and  scattered,  the  shafts 
with  flaming  points  discharged  by  Rama  and  Ravana  fell  from 
the  sky  on  the  earth,  and  the  twanging  of  their  bows,  causing 
great  terror  amongst  all  beings,  was  astonishing  to  hear.  Then 
that  amazing  hail  of  missiles,  that  the  mighty  hero  let  fly  in 
continuous  streams  from  his  burning  bow,  overwhelmed 
Ravana  who,  terrified,  took  to  flight  like  a  great  cloud  driven 
before  the  tempest.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    102 

Lakshmana's  miraculous  Recovery 

Seeing  the  courageous  Lakshmana  lying  on  the  battlefield 
drenched  in  blood,  struck  down  by  the  spear  discharged  by  the 
mighty  Ravana,  Rama  entered  into  a  terrible  duel  with  that  cruel 
titan  whom  he  overwhelmed  with  a  hail  of  arrows.  Then  he 
addressed  Sushena  and  said  : — 

"  The  valiant  Lakshmana,  struck  down  by  the  ruthless 
Ravana,  is  writhing  like  a  serpent,  filling  me  with  anguish ! 
When  I  behold  that  hero,  dearer  to  me  than  life  itself,  how,  in 
mine  affliction,  can  I  find  the  strength  to  fight?  If  my  brother, 
who  is  endowed  with  auspicious  marks,  that  proud  warrior, 
returns  to  the  five  elements,  of  what  use  is  life  or  prosperity  to 
me  ?  My  prowess  is  ebbing  away  as  it  were  and  my  bow  seems 
to  be  falling  from  my  grasp ;  mine  arrows  are  blunted,  mine 
eyes  blinded  with  tears,  my  limbs  are  heavy  as  when  one  is 
overcome  by  sleep,  my  thoughts  wander  and  I  long  to  die !  In 
this  extreme  misfortune  in  which  I  am  plunged,  weeping,  my 
mind  distracted  on  seeing  my  brother,  who  is  emitting  inarticulate 
cries,  lying  in  the  dust  of  the  battlefield,  brought  low  by  the 
wicked  Ravana,  a  prey  to  suffering  and  seriously  wounded  in  his 
vital  parts,  even  victory  cannot  bring  me  felicity,  O  Hero.  If  the 
moon  is  hidden  from  sight  what  delight  can  it  give  ?  Of  what 
use  is  it  to  fight  ?  What  purpose  is  served  by  living  ?  The 
combat  has  no  longer  any  meaning  since  Lakshmana  is  lying 
dead  in  the  forefront  of  the  battle.  As  that  illustrious  warrior 
followed  me  when  I  retired  to  the  forest  so  will  I  follow  him  now 
to  the  abode  of  death. 

"  Ever  affectionate  to  his  kinsfolk,  he  was  undeviatingly 
devoted  to  me ;  I  was  led  to  this  pass  by  the  titans  who  have 
made  use  of  magic  in  the  fight.  Wives  may  be  found  everywhere 
and  everywhere  one  may  meet  with  friends  but  I  see  no  place 
where  one  could  find  so  dear  a  brother.  Without  Lakshmana  of 
what  use  will  it  be  for  me  to  rule  over  a  kingdom,  O  Invincible 
Warrior  ?  What  shall  I  say  to  Sumitra  who  loves  her  son  so 
294 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

tenderly  ?  I  shall  not  be  able  to  endure  the  reproaches  with 
which  she  will  address  me.  What  shall  I  say  to  my  mother 
Kaushalya  or  even  to  Kaikeyi  ?  What  answer  shall  I  give  to 
Bharata  and  the  exceedingly  powerful  Shatrughna  ?  Having 
gone  with  him  to  the  forest,  how  can  I  return  without  him  ? 
Better  were  it  to  die  than  suffer  the  censure  of  my  family.  What 
sin  did  I  commit  in  a  former  life  that  my  virtuous  brother  is 
now  lying  dead  before  mine  eyes  ?  O  My  Brother,  O  Foremost 
of  Men,  O  First  of  Heroes,  O  Prince,  why,  forsaking  me,  wilt 
thou  repair  to  the  other  regions  ?  How  comes  it  that  thou  dost 
not  answer  me  who  am  lamenting  ?  Rise,  look  about  thee,  why 
dost  thou  remain  lying  there  ?  Witness  my  grief  with  thine  own 
eyes  !  In  my  despair,  be  my  comforter,  O  Long-armed  Warrior, 
overwhelmed  as  1  am  with  anguish,  wandering  distracted  amidst 
the  woods  and  mountains." 

As  Rama  was  speaking  thus,  overwhelmed  with  affliction, 
Sushena,  in  order  to  comfort  him,  addressed  these  well- 
considered  words  to  him : — 

"  O  Tiger  among  Men,  abandon  this  idea  that  causes  thee 
pain,  this  thought  that  pierces  thine  heart  as  a  javelin  in  the 
forefront  of  the  battle.  Kay,  Lakshmana,  the  enhancer  of 
prosperity,  has  not  rejoined  the  five  elements  for  his  features 
have  not  changed  nor  is  he  pale,  rather  is  his  countenance 
serene  and  handsome !  Observe  how  the  palms  of  his  hands 
resemble  the  petals  of  a  lotus  and  his  eyes  are  bright.  Those  who 
appear  thus  have  not  yielded  up  their  lives,  O  Lord  of  all  Men ! 
Do  not  grieve  O  Hero,  Conqueror  of  thy  Foes,  Lakshmana 
lives,  and  the  proofs  are  the  multiple  beatings  of  his  heart  united 
with  his  sighs  even  though  his  body  lies  stretched  on  the  earth." 

Thus  spoke  the  extremely  sagacious  Sushena  to  Raghava  and 
thereafter  he  addressed  that  great  monkey,  Hanuman,  who  stood 
near  and  said : — 

"  O  Friend,  go  quickly,  repair  to  the  Mountain  Mahodaya  1 
Formerly  thou  hast  heard  of  it  from  Jambavan,  O  Warrior  !  On 
the  southern  peak  grow  curative  herbs,  the  plants  named 
Vishalyakarani,  Savarnyakarani,  Samjivakarani  and  also  Samd- 
hani  of  great  virtue.  Bring  them  back,  O  Warrior,  in  order  to 
revive  that  hero,  Lakshmana." 

At  these  words,  Hanuman  repaired  to  the  Mountain  of  Herbs 
»95 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

but  there  he  became  anxious,  for  that  illustrious  monkey  could 
not  recognize  those  remedial  plants.  Then  the  thought  came  to 
Maruti,  whose  strength  was  immeasurable,  *  I  will  carry  back 
the  peak  of  the  mountain  for  it  is  on  the  summit  that  the  aus- 
picious herbs  are  growing,  at  least  I  infer  so  from  what  Sushena 
has  said.  If  I  return  without  having  picked  the  Vishalyakarani, 
the  loss  of  time  will  prove  fatal  and  a  great  misfortune  will 
follow.* 

Reflecting  thus,  the  mighty  Hanuman  hastened  on  his  way 
and  when  he  reached  that  high  mountain,  he  shook  the  summit 
three  times  and  having  broken  it  off,  balanced  it,  with  its  multi- 
tudinous trees  in  full  flower  of  varying  fragrance,  in  his  two  hands. 
Thereafter,  like  a  dark  cloud  charged  with  rain,  that  monkey 
sprang  into  the  air  carrying  the  mountain  peak  and  returned  in 
great  haste  setting  it  down  and,  having  rested  awhile,  he  said  to 
Sushena : — 

"  I  am  not  conversant  with  the  medicinal  plants,  O  Bull 
among  Monkeys,  here  is  the  whole  summit  which  I  have  brought 
to  thee !  " 

At  these  words  of  the  son  of  Pavana,  Sushena,  the  foremost  of 
the  monkeys,  having  uprooted  the  herb,  took  hold  of  it  and  there 
was  great  amazement  among  the  monkeys  witnessing  Hanuman's 
feat  which  even  the  Gods  themselves  could  only  have  accom- 
plished with  difficulty. 

Then  the  foremost  of  monkeys,  Sushena,  having  crushed  that 
herb,  held  it  to  Lakshmana's  nostrils  and  on  inhaling  it  that 
prince,  the  scourge  of  his  foes,  who  was  riddled  with  arrows, 
instantly  rose  from  the  ground  released  from  the  darts  and  his 
sufferings.  Meanwhile  the  monkeys  beholding  him  standing 
erect  cried  out  '  Excellent  1  Excellent !  and,  full  of  joy,  paid 
homage  to  him. 

Then  Rama,  the  slayer  of  his  foes,  said  to  Lakshmana  : — 

"  Come,  Come !  "  and,  embracing  him,  pressed  him  close  to 
his  heart,  his  eyes  wet  with  tears.  Thereafter,  having  embraced 
him,  Raghava  said  to  Saumitri  : — "  O  Hero,  what  good  fortune 
to  see  thee  return  from  the  dead  !  Nay,  assuredly  neither  life 
nor  Sita  nor  victory  had  any  attraction  for  me ;  in  sooth  what 
reason  had  I  for  living  since  thou  hadst  returned  to  the  five 
elements  ? " 

296 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Then  Lakshmana,  pained,  answered  the  magnanimous 
Raghava  who  had  spoken  thus  and,  in  a  voice  trembling  with 
emotion,  said  :— 

"  Bound  by  thy  vow,  O  Thou  who  hast  truth  for  thy  prowess, 
it  does  not  become  thee  to  utter  such  cowardly  words !  Nay, 
those  who  speak  with  sincerity  do  not  render  a  promise  void  and 
the  proof  they  give  is  the  fulfilment  of  their  vow !  Thou 
shouldst  not  give  way  to  despair  on  mine  account,  O  Irre- 
proachable Hero !  Mayest  thou  redeem  thy  word  by  Ravana's 
death  this  day.  Nay,  when  he  comes  within  the  range  of  thy 
shafts,  thine  adversary  must  not  return  alive,  as  a  great  elephant 
may  not  live  when  he  falls  under  the  sharp  tooth  of  a  roaring 
lion.  I  desire  to  see  that  wretch  perish  ere  the  orb  of  the  day 
withdraws  behind  the  Astachala  Mountain,  his  task  accomplished . 
If  thou  seekest  the  death  of  Ravana  on  the  battlefield,  if  thou 
wishest  to  fulfil  thy  duty  and  if  thou  dost  aspire  to  re-capture  the 
princess,  O  Illustrious  Hero,  do  what  I  tell  thee  without  delay." 


CHAPTER    103 

Rama  and  Ravana  renew  their  Combat 

Hearing  Lakshmana's  words,  the  valiant  Raghava,  the  destroyer 
of  hostile  warriors,  at  the  head  of  his  forces,  took  up  his  bow  and 
stretching  it  allowed  a  shower  of  his  formidable  shafts  to  fall  on 
Ravana. 

From  his  side,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  mounted  on  his  chariot, 
rushed  on  Kakutstha,  as  Svarbhanu  on  Bhaskara ;  and  Dasha- 
griva,  standing  in  his  car,  assailed  Rama  with  darts  like  unto 
lightning,  as  a  great  cloud  covers  a  huge  mountain  with  its 
floods.  Then  Rama,  with  his  arrows  that  were  decorated  with 
gold  and  resembled  naming  brands,  overwhelmed  Dashagriva 
with  them  on  the  battlefield. 

On  this  the  Gods,  Gandharvas  and  Kinneras  declared : — 
'  This  combat  is  unequal,  Rama  is  on  foot  whilst  the  titan  is  in  a 
chariot ! '  whereupon  the  foremost  of  the  Gods,  the  blessed 
Shakra,  having  heard  the  words  of  the  Immortals*  called  Matali 
to  him  and  said : — 

»97 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  With  my  chariot  repair  speedily  to  where  the  illustrious 
Raghava  is  fighting  on  foot !  Go  to  the  battlefield  and  invite  him 
to  ascend  this  car ;  do  thou  render  this  signal  service  to  the  Gods ! " 
On  this  command  from  his  king,  Matali,  the  celestial  chariot- 
eer, bowing,  made  answer,  saying  : — 
"  With  all  speed  I  go  to  fulfil  my  duty  as  a  charioteer !  " 
Thereupon  he  harnessed  the  bay  horses  to  the  most  handsome 
of  cars,  the  body  of  which  being  wrought  with  gold  and  hung 
with  hundreds  of  little  bells,  with  its  emerald  shafts  shone  like 
the  rising  sun,  and  it  was  yoked  to  excellent  dappled  steeds 
flecked  with  white,  caparisoned  in  gold,  their  coats  gleaming 
like  the  orb  of  day.  A  standard  fluttered  on  a  golden  staff  over 
that  marvellous  car  belonging  to  Indra  and,  under  the  order  of 
the  King  of  the  Gods,  Matali  ascended  it  and,  leaving  the 
Celestial  Regions,  went  to  meet  Kakutstha.  Armed  with  a  lash, 
standing  in  the  car,  Matali,  the  charioteer  of  that  God  of  a 
Thousand  Eyes,  having  paid  obeisance  to  him  with  joined  palms, 
said  to  Rama  : — 

"  Saharaksha,1  O  Kakutstha,  O  Renowned  Destroyer  of  thy 
Foes,  has  lent  thee  this  car  so  that  thou  mayest  be  victorious ! 
Here  too  is  Indra's  great  bow,  his  shield  bright  as  fire,  his  arrows 
shining  like  the  sun  and  his  goodly  spear  well-burnished !  Ascend 
the  chariot,  O  Warrior,  and  with  me  as  thy  charioteer,  triumph 
over  the  Titan  Ravana,  as  did  Mahendra  over  the  Danavas  !  " 
Thus  addressed,  Rama  whose  splendour  illumines  the 
worlds,  circumambulated  the  car  and,  bowing,  ascended  it. 
Thereafter  a  wonderful  combat  of  chariots  ensued  between  the 
long-armed  Rama  and  the  Titan  Ravana,  causing  the  hair  to 
stand  on  end. 

Raghava,  skilled  in  the  use  of  powerful  arrows,  fought  with 
the  King  of  the  Titans,  matching  Gandharva  Weapon  against 
Gandharva  Weapon  and  Celestial  Arrow  against  Celestial  Arrow. 
Then  the  royal  night-ranger,  in  a  paroxysm  of  fury  let  fly  a 
formidable  missile  on  his  rival,  marvellous,  dreadful,  befitting  a 
demon.  Loosed  from  Ravana's  bow,  those  shafts,  decorated 
with  gold,  falling  on  Kakutstha,  were  transformed  into  serpents 
of  subde  venom  and  those  fearful  monsters  with  brassy  faces, 
vomiting  searing  flames  from  their  gaping  mouths,  sprang  on 

1  The  Lord  of  a  Thousand  Eyes,  Indra. 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Rama,  and  those  reptiles  whose  contact  was  equal  to  Vasufci  of 
iron  coils  and  violent  poison,  enveloped  all  regions  on  every  side 
filling  the  whole  of  space. 

Seeing  those  serpents  falling  on  him  in  the  fight,  Rama  chose 
the  dreadful  and  appalling  Garuda  Weapon  and  discharged  it. 
Leaving  Raghava's  bow,  those  golden-hafted  arrows,  brilliant  as 
flames,  transformed  themselves  into  golden  eagles,  slayers  of 
serpents,  and  all  the  darts  in  the  form  of  snakes  were  destroyed 
by  arrows  in  the  shape  of  birds,  that  belonged  to  Rama,  who  was 
able  to  change  his  form  at  will. 

Enraged  at  the  destruction  of  his  weapon,  Ravana,  the  Lord  of 
the  Titans,  caused  a  shower  of  formidable  shafts  to  fall  on  Rama 
and  while  he  was  riddling  Rama  of  imperishable  exploits  with 
thousands  of  darts,  he  wounded  Matali  with  countless  others. 
Thereafter,  having  aimed  at  the  golden  standard,  Ravana 
shattered  it  with  a  single  shaft  and  the  golden  device  fell  from 
the  height  of  the  chariot  to  the  floor.  With  a  series  of  arrows  he 
struck  Indra's  steeds,  to  the  exceeding  terror  of  the  Gods, 
Gandharvas,  Charanas  and  also  the  Danavas  and,  seeing  Rama 
wounded,  the  Siddhas  and  great  Rishis  were  troubled  as  also 
the  King  of  the  Monkeys  and  Bibishana. 

When  the  moon  of  Rama  was  concealed  from  their  sight  by 
Rahu  in  the  form  of  Ravana,  Budha,  in  the  constellation  of 
Prajapati,  rushed  on  Rohini,  the  beloved  of  Shashin,  to  the 
misfortune  of  all  beings.  With  its  mist-wreathed  waves, 
naming  as  it  were,  the  ocean,  surging  up  in  fury,  seemed  to  touch 
the  orb  of  day  ;  and  the  sun  in  the  grasp  of  the  Planet  Dhumak- 
etu  assumed  a  brassy  hue  dreadful  to  behold,  its  rays  extin- 
guished, revealing  a  headless  trunk  on  its  disc ;  Angaraka  too 
was  in  opposition  to  the  brilliant  star  of  the  Koshalas,  the 
presiding  Deities  of  which  being  Indra  and  Agni ;  and  in  die 
heavens,  that  planet  tormented  Vishaka  also,  and  Dashagriva 
with  his  ten  faces  and  twenty  arms,  equipped  with  his  bow, 
looked  like  the  Mountain  Mainaka. 

Meanwhile  Rama,  overwhelmed  by  that  ten-necked  demon, 
was  unable  to  loose  his  arrows  in  the  conflict  and,  knitting  his 
brows,  enraged,  his  eyes  inflamed,  was  transported  with  anger 
and  it  seemed  as  if  he  would  consume  the  titan. 

On  seeing  the  furious  countenance  of  the  virtuous  Rama, 
299 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

all  beings  were  seized  with  terror,  the  earth  shook,  the  moun- 
tains, frequented  by  lions  and  tigers,  trembled,  the  trees 
swayed  to  and  fro,  the  Ocean,  that  Lord  of  Rivers  was  agitated 
and  flocks  of  crows,  braying  like  donkeys,  described  circles 
in  the  sky  on  all  sides. 

Beholding  Rama  wrought  up  with  extreme  ire  and  those 
fearful  portents,  all  beings  were  filled  with  fear  and  Ravana  too 
felt  dismayed.  The  Gods  in  their  chariots,  the  Gandharvas,  the 
great  Serpents,  the  Rishis,  the  Danavas,  Daityas  and  winged 
creatures  of  the  air  gazed  down  on  that  conflict  between  those 
two  warriors,  who  fought  with  every  kind  of  dreadful  weapon, 
so  that  it  appeared  like  the  dissolution  of  the  worlds.  Suras  and 
Asuras  who  had  come  to  witness  the  struggle,  with  their  eyes 
followed  that  formidable  duel,  uttering  words  of  sympathy  and 
encouragement  and  the  assembled  Asuras  cried  out  to  Dasha- 
griva  *  Victory  to  Thee ! •  and  the  Suras  addressing  Rama 
reiterated  '  Triumph  !  Triumph !  * 

At  that  instant  the  wicked  Ravana,  in  his  fury  against  Rama 
whom  he  wished  to  slay,  took  hold  of  an  immense  weapon  that 
was  as  hard  as  diamond,  deafening,  the  destroyer  of  its  foe, 
furnished  with  spikes  like  unto  mountain  peaks,  dreadful  to 
conceive  or  behold,  and  Ravana  lifted  up  that  lance  with  its 
smoke-wreathed  flaming  point,  like  unto  the  fires  at  the  time  of 
the  final  dissolution  of  the  worlds,  that  was  greatly  to  be  feared, 
irresistible  and  which  death  itself  could  not  endure,  the  terror  of 
all  beings,  whom  it  was  able  to  crush  to  fragments.  At  the  height 
of  anger,  he  raised  his  strong  arm  and,  surrounded  by  his  brave 
troops,  brandishing  his  weapon,  that  colossus,  his  eyes  red  with 
fury,  emitted  a  piercing  cry  in  order  to  encourage  his  forces,  and 
earth,  sky  and  the  four  quarters  trembled  at  that  fearful  shout 
of  the  King  of  the  Titans.  With  his  stout  arm,  taking  hold  of 
that  weapon  he  emitted  a  great  cry  and  addressed  his  opponent 
insolently  in  these  words  :— 

"  This  spear,  as  strong  as  a  diamond,  O  Rama,  that  I  wield  in 
my  wrath,  through  my  prowess  will  shortly  rob  thee  and  thy 
brother  of  your  lives  !  Thou  shalt  share  the  fate  of  my  brave 
soldiers  whom  thou  didst  massacre  in  the  forefront  of  the 
battle.  Stay  therefore  that  I  may  strike  thee  down  with  this 
lance,  O  Raghava." 

300 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

At  these  words,  the  King  of  the  Titans  hurled  his  weapon  at 
Rama,  and  loosed  by  Havana's  hand,  that  lance  wreathed  in 
lightning,  deafening  with  its  eight  bells,  passed  through  the  air 
with  a  blinding  flash. 

Seeing  that  naming  spear,  formidable  to  behold,  Rama 
stretched  his  bow  and  discharged  an  arrow  with  force,  but  as  the 
spear  fell,  Raghava  loosed  a  mass  of  arrows  to  intercept  it,  so 
that  he  appeared  like  Vasava  with  his  floods  seeking  to  stay  the 
encroachment  of  the  fires  at  the  end  of  the  world  period.  As 
butterflies  are  consumed  by  flames,  so  were  those  shafts  con- 
sumed by  Havana's  huge  spear  ;  then  Raghava,  seeing  his  aerial 
shafts  reduced  to  ashes,  pulverized  by  contact  with  that  lance, 
was  transported  with  anger  and  furious  in  the  extreme.  There- 
after Rama,  Joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  took  up  his  spear 
favoured  by  Vasava,  that  Matali  had  brought  to  him ;  wielding 
it  with  his  powerful  arm,  that  lance,  the  destroyer  of  the  worlds, 
with  its  sonorous  bells  lit  up  the  sky  like  unto  a  brilliant  meteor. 
In  its  flight,  colliding  with  the  spear  belonging  to  that  Indra  of 
the  Titans,  it  was  shattered  by  the  impact  and  that  enormous 
lance  fell  bereft  of  its  splendour.  Thereafter  Rama  pierced 
Ravana's  swiftly-moving  steeds  with  shafts  loosed  with  great 
force  that  were  thunderous  and  flew  straight  to  their  target. 
Displaying  all  his  strength,  he  wounded  his  rival  in  the  breast 
with  penetrating  javelins  and  his  brow  with  three  arrows, 
whereupon  Havana,  his  whole  body  pierced  with  arrows  and 
covered  with  blood,  which  flowed  from  wounds  in  all  his  limbs, 
resembled  an  Ashoka  Tree  in  full  flower.  His  body  riddled  with 
darts  loosed  by  Rama,  bathed  in  blood,  feeling  himself  utterly 
exhausted,  that  Lord  of  the  Rangers  of  the  Night,  in  the  midst 
of  his  army,  was  filled  with  extreme  wrath.

Grievously  wounded  by  the  wrathful  Kakutstha,  Ravana,  that 

proud  warrior  fell  into  a  great  rage.    His  eyes  flaming  with 

anger,  that  titan  raised  his  bow  in  a  paroxysm  of  fury  and  in  that 

301 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

great  combat,  overwhelmed  Raghava  with  blows.  Like  unto  a 
heavy  shower,  Ravana  deluged  Rama  as  clouds  fill  a  pond. 
Drowned  in  a  rain  of  arrows  loosed  from  the  titan's  bow  in  the 
fight,  Kakutstha  stood  firm  like  unto  a  mighty  mountain. 

Then  that  hero,  resolute  in  combat,  with  his  shafts  deflected 
the  succession  of  darts  which  fell  upon  him  like  unto  the  rays  of 
the  sun.  Thereafter,  with  a  skilled  hand,  the  ranger  of  the  night, 
in  fury,  struck  the  breast  of  the  magnanimous  Raghava  with 
thousands  of  darts  and  the  elder  brother  of  Lakshmana,  covered 
with  blood,  looked  like  a  huge  Kimshuka  Tree  in  flower  in  the 
forest.  His  wrath  roused  by  the  wounds  he  had  received,  the 
exceedingly  powerful  Kakutstha  armed  himself  with  shafts  the 
lustre  of  which  resembled  the  sun's  at  the  end  of  the  world 
period ;  and  Rama  and  Ravana,  both  transported  with  anger, 
became  invisible  to  each  other  on  the  battlefield  that  was 
darkened  by  their  shafts. 

Thereafter  at  the  height  of  fury,  the  valiant  son  of  Dasaratha 
addressed  his  adversary  in  these  mocking  and  ironic  words : — 

"  Having  carried  away  my  consort  against  her  will  in  Janas- 
thana,  imposing  on  her  ignorance,  thou  art  verily  no  hero ! 
Bearing  away  by  force,  Vaidehi  who  was  wandering  forlornly  in 
the  great  forest  far  from  me,  thou  thinkest  *  I  am  a  great  hero  !  * 
Because  thou  hast  molested  other  women  who  were  without  a 
protector,  which  is  the  act  of  a  coward,  thou  deemest  thyself  to 
be  a  hero,  O  Valiant  One !  O  Thou  who  hast  overthrown  the 
ramparts  of  duty,  O  Arrogant  Wretch  of  fickle  nature,  in  thine 
insolence,  thou  hast  invited  death  into  thine  house,  saying '  I  am 
a  hero  ! '  Is  it  in  the  role  of  the  valiant  brother  of  Dhanada  that 
thou,  grown  presumptuous  on  account  of  power,  hast  accom- 
plished this  memorable,  great  and  glorious  exploit?  Thou 
shalt  presently  receive  a  fitting  recompense  for  this  infamous  act. 

0  Wretch,  in  thine  own  estimation,  thinking  to  thyself  'lama 
hero/  thou  wast  not  ashamed  to  bear  Sita  away  like  a  thief.   Had 

1  been  there  when  thou  didst  affront  Vaidehi,  handling  her  so 
brutally,  I  should  have  dispatched  thee  to  rejoin  thy  brother 
Khara  by  striking  thee  down  with  my  shafts.  By  good  fortune, 
O  Insensate  One,  thou  art  now  before  me ;  to-day  with  my 
penetrating  darts,  I  shall  hurl  thee  into  Yama's  abode.  To-day 
thy  head  with  its  dazzling  earrings,  severed  by  my  weapon,  shall 

302 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

roll  in  the  dust  on  the  battlefield  where  the  wild  beasts  will 
devour  it.  Vultures  will  swoop  on  thy  breast  when  thou  art 
lying  stretched  on  the  earth,  O  Ravana,  and  will  drink  the  blood 
greedily  that  flows  from  the  wounds  inflicted  by  my  sharp  arrows. 
To-day  pricked  by  my  shares,  lying  without  life,  birds  of  prey 
will  tear  out  thine  entrails  as  eagles  destroy  serpents  !  ** 

Speaking  thus,  the  valiant  Rama,  scourge  of  his  foes,  covered 
that  Indra  among  Titans,  who  stood  near,  with  a  hail  of  arrows, 
and  his  courage,  strength  and  martial  ardour  in  loosing  his 
shafts  was  redoubled.  Then  all  the  celestial  weapons  belonging 
to  Raghava,  versed  in  the  Science  of  the  Self,  presented  them- 
selves before  him1  and,  in  his  joy,  that  illustrious  hero  felt  the 
dexterity  of  his  touch  increase. 

On  these  auspicious  signs  appearing  of  themselves,  Rama,  the 
Destroyer  of  the  Titans,  attacked  Ravana  himself  with  increasing 
violence. 

Wounded  by  innumerable  rocks  thrown  by  the  monkeys  and 
the  darts  showered  upon  him  by  Raghava,  Dashagriva's  heart 
fainted  within  him  and,  in  the  agitation  of  his  soul,  he  neither 
took  up  his  arrows  nor  stretched  his  bow  nor  sought  to  oppose 
Rama's  valour,  while  the  arrows  and  missiles  of  every  kind 
discharged  unceasingly  by  his  adversary  had  death  as  their 
target  so  that  the  hour  of  his  doom  appeared  imminent. 

Then  his  charioteer,  observing  the  peril,  drove  the  chariot 
calmly  and  slowly  out  of  the  tray  and,  aghast  at  the  appearance 
of  the  king,  who  had  sunk  down  bereft  of  energy,  he  turned  that 
dreadful  car,  rumbling  like  a  cloud,  and  left  the  battlefield 
in  haste. 


CHAPTER     105 

Ravana  reproaches  Us  Charioteer 

Distracted  with  fury,  his  eyes  red  with  anger,  urged  on  by 
destiny,  Ravana  addressed  his  charioteer,  saying  : — 

"Am  I  then  bereft  of  valour  and  strength,  deprived  of  prowess, 
cowardly,  infirm  of  purpose,  weak,  without  energy,  devoid  of 

1  That  is  the  Deities  presiding  over  them  presented  themselves  before  Rama. 
303 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

magic  powers  and  debarred  from  combat,  that  thou  hast  failed 
me  and  actest  on  thine  own  understanding  ?  How  comes  it  that 
without  respect  for  me  and  disregarding  my  commands,  in  the 
presence  of  the  foe,  thou  didst  drive  my  chariot  from  the  field ! 
Through  thine  error  this  day,  O  Vile  Wretch,  that  which  I  had 
won  over  a  long  period,  glory,  valour,  honour  and  renown,  are  all 
lost  to  me !  Before  a  foe  famed  for  his  prowess,  who  prides 
himself  on  his  exploits,  thou  hast  transformed  me  who  delights 
in  battle,  into  a  coward.  If  it  is  not  through  heedlessness  that 
thou  hast  acted  thus,  O  Villain,  my  suspicions  are  well  founded 
and  thou  hast  been  bribed  by  the  enemy.  Assuredly  it  was  not 
an  act  of  friendship  or  devotion ;  only  a  foe  would  conduct 
himself  as  thou  hast  done.  If  thou  hast  any  loyalty  to  me,  then 
return  in  the  chariot  instantly  ere  mine  adversary  has  departed 
and  remember  the  benefits  thou  hast  received  m  my  hands." 

At  these  reproaches  from  the  insensate  Ravana,  the  sagacious 
charioteer  made  answer  in  words  that  were  moderate  and  full  of 
good  sense,  saying : — 

"lam  neither  afraid,  nor  am  I  mad,  nor  do  I  yield  to  the 
solicitations  of  a  foe,  nor  am  I  negligent,  nor  have  I  ceased  to  be 
loyal  to  thee,  nor  have  I  forgotten  the  benefits  I  have  received 
from  thy  hand  !  It  was  through  my  desire  to  be  of  service  to 
thee  and  to  safeguard  thy  glory  and  on  account  of  a  sincere 
attachment,  that  I  acted  as  I  thought  best !  O  Great  King,  thou 
shouldst  not  unjustly  regard  me  as  a  vile  and  cowardly  wretch,  I 
who  seek  only  to  do  that  which  is  agreeable  to  thee.  Hear  me,  I 
will  tell  thee  the  reason  why  I  took  thy  chariot,  resembling  a 
flowing  current  driven  back  by  the  tide,  from  the  field. 

"  Observing  thy  fatigue  following  on  the  tremendous  struggle, 
I  no  longer  recognized  thy  proud  assurance  nor  thy  superior 
strength.  By  drawing  the  chariot  unceasingly,  my  steeds  were 
overcome  with  fatigue,  they  were  prostrate  and  overcome  with 
the  heat,  like  unto  kine  lashed  by  the  rain ;  furthermore 
amidst  the  portents  that  were  manifest  in  great  numbers,  not 
one,  it  seemed  to  me,  was  favourable  to  us. 

"  One  should  at  the  proper  time  and  place  observe  the 
characteristics,  gestures,  facial  expression,  depression  or  ex- 
hilaration and  the  measure  of  fatigue  of  one's  master,  O  Mighty 
Hero ;  also  the  place  where  the  earth  is  firm  and  where  it  is 
304 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

uneven  or  level,  where  it  is  flat  or  hilly  and  the  time  for  combat ; 
when  the  enemy  lays  himself  open  to  attack,  how  to  advance  and 
retire,  to  halt  or  go  forward,  to  meet  the  enemy  or  retreat  to  a 
distance,  all  this  must  be  known  by  a  charioteer,  as  he  stands  in 
his  chariot. 

"  It  was  on  account  of  thy  prostration  and  the  exhaustion  of 
thy  steeds  and  in  order  to  mitigate  this  terrible  fatigue,  that  I 
undertook  those  specific  measures.  It  was  not  from  caprice,  O 
Warrior,  that  I  drove  the  chariot  away ;  it  was  devotion  to  my 
lord  that  made  me  resolve  to  act  in  this  wise.  Issue  any  command 
thou  desirest,  O  Hero,  O  Scourge  of  Thy  Foes,  and  I  shall 
fulfil  it  implicitly  with  all  my  heart !  " 

Then  Havana,  fully  satisfied  with  the  reply  of  his  charioteer, 
addressed  many  words  of  praise  to  him  and,  in  his  martial  ardour, 
said: — 

"  Speedily  drive  my  chariot  towards  Raghava,  O  Charioteer, 
Ravana  is  incapable  of  turning  back  ere  he  has  destroyed  his 
enemies  in  battle !  " 

Speaking  thus,  the  King  of  the  Titans  standing  in  his  chariot, 
bestowed  a  brilliant  ring  of  great  price  on  his  charioteer  and, 
under  his  orders,  the  driver  set  out  to  the  battlefield.  Urged  on 
by  Ravana's  command,  the  charioteer  whipped  his  steeds  into 
a  gallop  and,  in  an  instant,  the  great  chariot  belonging  to  that 
Indra  among  the  Titans  stood  before  Rama  in  the  field.

Meanwhile,  seeing  Rama  exhausted  by  the  fight,  standing 
absorbed  in  thought  on  the  battlefield,  and  Ravana,  racing 
him,  preparing  to  begin  the  encounter  anew,  the  blessed 
Agastya  who  had  joined  the  Gods,  and  also  come  there  to

These  words  dispelled  the  grief  of  the  illustrious  Raghava  who

rejoiced  and  advanced  towards  him  in  order  to  enter  into  combat, 
calling  up  his  whole  strength  with  the  intention  of  slaying  him. 
At  that  instant  the  Deity  of  the  Sun,  amidst  the  Host  of  the

of  the  Night  was  at  hand,  casting  glances  of  joy  and  supreme 
satisfaction  on  Rama,  approached  him  and  said  : — "  Put  forth 
thine  whole  strength !  "

Thereafter  Ravana's  charioteer  drove  his  car  forward  speedily, 
with  joy,  eating  up  space  as  it  were,  and  that  chariot,  capable  of 
crushing  hostile  armies,  bore  an  immense  standard  and  resem- 
bled the  City  of  the  Gandharvas.  Harnessed  to  excellent  steeds, 
garlanded  with  gold,  it  was  filled  with  implements  of  war  and 
adorned  with  fags  and  banners.  The  scourge  of  enemy  forces 
and  the  joy  of  its  own,  Ravana's  car  was  driven  with  exceeding 
velocity  by  its  charioteer. 

Then  that  prince  of  men,  Rama,  observed  the  chariot  of  the 
King  of  the  Titans,  rolling  noisily  along  with  its  great  standard, 
harnessed  to  dreadful  black  horses  and  resembling  a  Vimana1  in 
space,  bright  as  the  sun,  dazzling  to  behold,  like  unto  Indra's 
bow,  and  the  rain  of  arrows  falling  therefrom  resembled  the 
waters  loosed  by  a  cloud.  Seeing  the  chariot  of  his  adversary, 
which  bore  down  upon  him  like  a  cloud,  with  a  sound  resembling 
a  mountain  shattered  by  lightning,  Rama  instantly  stretching  his 
bow,  like  unto  the  crescent  moon,  said  to  Matali,  the  charioteer 
of  that  God  of  a  Thousand  Eyes  : — 

"  O  Matali,  behold  the  furious  pace  of  the  chariot  of  mine 
adversary  as  he  rushes  upon  me  in  violent  rage !  Be  vigilant

accustomed  as  thou  art  to  drive  Purandara's  chariot,  yet  in  mine 
ardent  desire  to  enter  into  combat,  I  make  appeal  to  thine 
experience,  I  do  not  instruct  thee." 

Extremely  gratified  by  Rama's  words,  Matali,  the  most 
excellent  charioteer  of  the  Gods  increased  the  speed  of  his  car. 
Passing  Ravana's  great  chariot  on  the  right  hand,  he  covered  it 
with  the  dust  of  his  own  wheels. 

Enraged,  Dashagriva,  his  eyes  inflamed  with  anger,  riddled 
Rama  with  arrows  as  he  stood  before  him.  Provoked  by  the 
blows,  Rama,  whose  strength  was  redoubled  by  his  fury,  armed 
himself  with  Indra's  extremely  powerful  bow  and  his  great 
arrows  of  exceeding  swiftness  that  glittered  like  the  rays  of  the 
sun.  Thereupon  a  fierce  combat  ensued  between  the  two 
warriors,  who  stood  face  to  face  like  two  proud  lions,  each 
desirous  of  destroying  die  other. 

At  that  moment,  Devas,  Gandharvas,  Siddhas  and  Para- 
marishis,  hoping  for  Ravana's  downfall,  assembled  to  witness 
that  duel  between  those  chariots. 

Thereafter  dreadful  portents  appeared,  causing  the  hair  to 
stand  on  end,  foreshadowing  death  to  Ravana  and  victory  to 
Raghava.  And  the  Gods  caused  blood  to  fall  on  Ravana's 
chariot ;  a  great  whirlwind  blew  from  left  to  right  whilst,  in  the 
sky,  a  large  flock  of  vultures  flew  over  his  head  following  the 
evolutions  of  his  car.  Though  still  day,  Lanka,  enshrouded  in 
the  light  of  dusk,  hued  like  a  Japa  flower,  seemed  aglow ;  great 
meteors  accompanied  by  lightning  fell  with  the  sound  of  thunder 
and  the  titans  were  seized  with  terror  witnessing  those  portents 
so  unfavourable  to  Ravana.  In  whatever  direction  the  titan 
drove,  the  earth  shook  and  the  limbs  of  his  soldiers  appeared  as 
if  paralysed.  The  rays  of  the  sun  falling  before  Ravana  seemed 
to  him  coppery,  yellow  and  white,  like  unto  mountain  ores,  and 
the  vultures  and  jackals  who  pursued  him,  their  jaws  vomiting 
flames,  began  to  howl  on  beholding  bis  lugubrious  and  downcast 
mien  distorted  with  anger.  Contrary  winds  blew  raising  clouds 
of  dust  on  the  battlefield,  so  that  the  King  of  the  Titans  was 
unable  to  distinguish  anything.  Indra  loosed  his  thunderbolts 
on  all  sides  on  his  army  with  an  unendurable  sound,  without  a 
single  threatening  cloud  appearing ;  all  the  cardinal  points  were 
enveloped  in  darkness  and  a  dense  cloud  of  dust  hid  the  sky.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Dreadful  birds1  fought  desperately  among  themselves,  falling  in 
hundreds  before  his  chariot,  emitting  fearful  cries.  From  his 
horses'  flanks  sparks  flew  continually  and  from  their  eyes  tears 
fell,  fire  and  water  thus  issuing  from  them  simultaneously. 
Many  other  terrifying  portents,  foretelling  Ravana's  death, 
appeared,  whilst  omens  propitious  to  Rama,  foreshadowing  his 
imminent  triumph,  could  be  seen. 

Beholding  those  inauspicious  signs,  Raghava  was  greatly 
delighted  and  regarded  Ravana  as  already  slain.  Seeing  those 
portents  relating  to  himself,  which  he  knew  how  to  interpret, 
Rama  experienced  supreme  felicity  and,  full  of  confidence, 
manifested  a  matchless  energy  in  the  struggle. 


chapter    108 

The  Fluctuations  of  Combat 

Then  the  desperate  duel  of  chariots  between  Rama  and  Ravana 
broke  out  with  increased  fury  so  that  all  the  worlds  were  seized 
with  terror. 

The  battalions  of  titans  and  innumerable  companies  of 
monkeys  stood  motionless  with  weapons  in  their  hands  and, 
beholding  those  two  warriors,  man  and  titan,  all  were  amazed, 
their  hearts  beating  rapidly.  Ready  for  combat,  their  arms  filled 
with  every  kind  of  missile,  they  stood  absorbed  in  the  spectacle, 
forgetting  to  loose  their  shafts  at  one  another,  and  the  titans  had 
their  eyes  riveted  on  Ravana  and  the  monkeys  on  Rama  so  that 
both  armies  took  on  a  strange  aspect. 

Meanwhile,  witnessing  those  portents,  both  Raghava  and 
Ravana,  steady,  resolute  and  full  of  anger,  fought  with  deter- 
mined courage.  '  I  shall  triumph  '  reflected  Kakutstha,  *  I 
must  die  '  thought  Ravana  and  both  displayed  their  full  strength 
with  assurance  in  the  encounter. 

At  that  instant,  Dashagriva,  in  his  wrath,  placed  his  arrows 
(on  the  bow)  and  loosed  them  with  force  m  the  direction  of  the 
standard  on  Raghava's  chariot  but  those  missiles  failed  to  reach 
the  flag  in  Purandara's  car  and,  glancing  off  the  support,  fell 

1  Sharikas — Turdas  Salica  or  Gracula  Religtosa. 
310 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

on  the  earth.  Meanwhile  Rama,  enraged,  stretched  his  bow  with 
energy,  resolving  to  return  blow  for  blow  and,  aiming  at  Ravana's 
banner,  loosed  a  sharp  arrow  resembling  a  great  snake,  irresistible, 
shining  in  its  own  lustre ;  and  he  let  fly  his  weapon  in  the  direction 
of  Dashagriva's  standard,  which  being  severed,  fell  to  the  earth. 

Beholding  his  flag  torn  down  and  overthrown,  the  extremely 
powerful  Ravana,  inflamed  with  ire,  blazed  with  wrath  and 
indignation  and,  under  the  goad  of  his  fury,  let  fall  a  hail  of 
flaming  shafts,  striking  Rama's  horses.  These  celestial  steeds, 
however,  did  not  flinch,  remaining  motionless  as  if  brushed  by 
lotus  stalks  and,  seeing  the  horses  unaffrighted,  Ravana,  enraged, 
discharged  a  fresh  rain  of  arrows,  maces,  iron  bars,  discus, 
clubs,  rocks,  trees,  spears  and  axes,  and  those  weapons  were  all 
created  by  magic,  and,  summoning  up  all  his  powers,  he  loosed 
them  in  hundreds  and  thousands.  Appalling  and  terrible  was 
that  unending  flood  of  weapons  re-echoing  with  a  sinister  sound 
but  Ravana  failed  to  strike  Rama's  chariot,  though  his  shafts  fell 
on  the  monkey  host  on  all  sides  covering  the  whole  of  space,  and 
thus  Dashagriva,  unheeding,  fought  on. 

Seeing  him  deploying  increasing  efforts  in  the  struggle, 
Kakutstha,  as  if  smiling,  took  up  his  sharp  arrows  and  loosed 
them  in  hundreds  and  thousands.  Observing  them  fall,  Ravana, 
with  his  shafts,  covered  the  entire  sky  and,  on  account  of  that 
rain  of  dazzling  missiles  loosed  by  those  two  antagonists,  it 
seemed  as  if  a  second  heaven  of  weapons  had  been  created  and, 
amongst  them,  there  was  not  one  that  did  not  attain  its  target, 
not  one,  that  did  not  pierce  another  and  not  one,  that  was  loosed 
in  vain ;  and,  having  collided  with  one  another,  they  fell  to  the 
ground. 

Thus  Rama  and  Ravana  fought  with  an  increasing  supply  of 
weapons  and,  in  the  struggle,  they  showered  down  their  spears 
without  pause  to  right  and  left,  so  that  these  formidable  weapons 
covered  the  firmament ;  Rama  striking  Ravana's  steeds  and 
Ravana  striking  those  belonging  to  Rama  ;  thus,  both  exchanged 
blow  for  blow  and  both,  in  the  height  of  anger,  entered  upon  a 
tremendous  duel  causing  the  hair  to  stand  on  end.  Then  with 
sharpened  arrows  Rama  and  Ravana  continued  their  combat  and, 
contemplating  his  broken  standard,  Ravana  was  consumed  with 
rage.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER     109 

The  Duel  continues 

Witnessing  the  combat  between  Rama  and  Ravana,  all  beings 
were  struck  with  amazement  and  those  two  warriors,  assuming 
a  dreadful  aspect  in  the  struggle,  highly  enraged,  determined  on 
mutual  slaughter  and,  in  their  excellent  cars,  bore  down  on  each 
other.  Thereupon  their  drivers,  parading  their  skill  as  chariot- 
eers, advanced,  circled  and  manoeuvred  in  various  ways.  In 
their  rapid  course  and  swift  evolutions,  those  two  marvellous 
chariots  ranged  the  battlefield,  whilst  the  two  warriors  discharged 
countless  shafts  on  each  other,  like  unto  clouds  letting  loose  their 
showers. 

Having  displayed  their  immeasurable  resource  in  the  use  of 
weapons,  those  two  champions  halted  face  to  face,  chariot  shaft 
to  chariot  shaft,  their  horses'  heads  touching,  their  standards 
intertwined.  Then  Rama  loosed  four  sharp  arrows,  driving  back 
Ravana's  four  spirited  steeds  and  he,  furious  on  beholding  them 
retreat,  let  fly  his  penetrating  shafts  on  Raghava. 

That  hero,  however,  grievously  wounded  by  the  mighty 
Dashagriva,  manifested  neither  agitation  nor  emotion  and  again 
the  Ten-necked  One  discharged  his  shafts,  that  resounded  like 
thunder,  aiming  at  the  charioteer  of  that  God  who  bears  the 
Thunderbolt ;  and  he  struck  Matali  with  his  arrows  with  great 
force  without  being  able  to  disturb  him  in  any  way  or  cause  him 
to  falter.  Nevertheless  Raghava,  indignant  at  the  affront 
offered  to  Matali  more  than  if  it  had  been  directed  at  himself, 
with  the  aid  of  a  succession  of  darts,  decided  to  humble  his 
adversary,  and  the  valiant  Raghava  discharged  twenty,  thirty, 
sixty  and  thereafter  hundreds  and  thousands  of  shafts  on  his 
rival's  chariot. 

On  his  side,  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  standing  in  his 
car,  enraged,  overwhelmed  Rama  with  an  avalanche  of  maces 
and  clubs  and  the  struggle  became  more  desperate  causing  die 
hair  to  stand  on  end. 

51a 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

At  the  sound  of  the  maces,  clubs  and  axes  and  the  loosing  of 
plumed  arrows,  the  seven  seas  were  agitated  and  the  tumult  of 
the  oceans  sowed  terror  in  the  Danavas  and  Pannagas  in  their 
thousands,  in  the  depths  of  hell.  The  earth  shook  with  its 
mountains,  forests  and  jungles ;  the  orb  of  day  lost  its  brilliance 
and  the  wind  ceased  to  blow.  Devas,  Gandharvas,  Siddhas  and 
Paramarishis  were  wrought  up  with  anxiety  as  also  the  Kinneras 
and  Great  Serpents. 

"  May  good  fortune  attend  the  cows  and  brahmins  !  May  all 
the  worlds  endure  forever !  May  Raghava  emerge  triumphant 
in  his  combat  with  Ravana,  the  King  of  the  Titans  !  ** 

Offering  up  these  prayers,  the  Devas  accompanied  by  hosts  of 
Rishis  witnessed  that  duel  between  Rama  and  Ravana,  a  spec- 
tacle that  caused  the  hair  to  stand  on  end,  and  the  hosts  of  the 
Gandharvas  and  Apsaras,  watching  that  indescribable  struggle, 
cried  out : — "  The  sky  resembles  the  sea  and  the  sea  the  sky,  but 
the  fight  between  Rama  and  Ravana  resembles  nought  but 
itself!" 

Thus  did  they  speak  on  beholding  the  combat  between  Rama 
and  Ravana.  In  his  rage,  the  Long-armed  Warrior,  the  increaser 
of  the  glory  of  the  Raghus,  Rama,  placed  an  arrow,  like  unto  a 
venomous  reptile,  on  his  bow  and  cut  off  one  of  Ravana's  heads, 
whereupon  that  glorious  head,  adorned  with  sparkling  earrings, 
rolled  on  the  earth  in  the  presence  of  the  Three  Worlds.  Never- 
theless another,  equal  to  the  former,  grew  immediately  and  Rama, 
with  a  steady  hand,  dexterously  sundered  the  second  head  with 
his  shafts.  Hardly  was  it  eliminated  when  another  head 
appeared  which  was  severed  once  more  by  Rama's  darts  like 
unto  thunderbolts.  Thereafter  he  struck  off  a  hundred  more, 
being  unable  to  bring  Ravana  low,  and  that  hero,  conversant  with 
every  weapon,  he  the  increaser  of  Kaushalya's  delight,  who  had 
made  use  of  innumerable  missiles,  reflected : — 

'  These  were  the  shafts  by  the  help  of  which  I  slew  Maricha, 
Khara,  and  Dushana  as  also  Viradha  in  the  Krauncha  Wood  and 
Kabandha  in  the  Dandaka  Forest ;  these  were  the  shafts  where- 
with I  transfixed  the  Sala  Trees  and  the  mountains  and  Bali  and 
with  which  I  agitated  the  ocean  !  All  these  weapons  found  their 
target,  how  is  it  that  they  have  so  little  power  over  Ravana  ?  ' 

Absorbed  though  he  was  in  his  reflections,  Raghava,  without 
313 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

ceasing  from  action,  let  loose  a  shower  of  arrows  on  the  breast  of 
his  adversary.  On  his  side,  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans, 
standing  in  his  chariot,  enraged,  overwhelmed  Rama  with  an 
avalanche  of  maces  and  clubs.  Thus  the  fearful  and  desperate 
conflict,  causing  the  hair  to  stand  on  end,  continued  in  the  air 
and  on  the  ground  and  thereafter  on  the  summit  of  the  mountain. 
Devas,  Danavas,  Yakshas,  Pisachas,  Uragas  and  Rakshasas 
watched  the  dreadful  combat  that  lasted  seven  days  and  neither 
by  night  nor  day  for  a  single  hour  did  Rama  and  Ravana  cease 
from  fighting  and  the  son  of  Dasaratha  and  the  Indra  of  the 
Titans  continued  to  struggle  thus.  Then  the  magnanimous 
charioteer  of  the  King  of  the  Gods,  beholding  no  sign  of  Raghava 
gaining  the  victory,  addressed  him  rapidly  in  the  following 
words. 

CHAPTER     I  10 

The  Death  of  Ravana 

At  that  moment,  Matali  sought  to  recall  Raghava's  thoughts, 
saying : — "  How  is  it  that  thou  dost  act  in  regard  to  Ravana  as  if 
thou  wert  unaware  of  thine  own  powers  ?  In  order  to  bring 
about  his  end,  discharge  Brahma's  Weapon  upon  him,  O  Lord  1 
Foretold  by  the  Gods,  the  hour  of  his  doom  is  at  hand !  " 

Prompted  by  Matali,  Rama  took  up  a  flaming  shaft  that  was 
hissing  like  a  viper,  formerly  bestowed  on  him  by  the  magnani- 
mous and  powerful  Sage  Agastya.  A  gift  of  the  Grandsire,  that 
weapon  never  missed  its  target  and  it  had  been  created  of  yore  by 
Brahma  for  Indra  and  bestowed  on  the  King  of  the  Gods  for  the 
conquest  of  the  Three  Worlds.  In  its  wings  was  the  wind,  in  its 
point  the  fire  and  the  sun,  in  its  haft  space,  and,  in  size,  it 
resembled  the  Mountains  Meru  and  Mandara.  With  its 
marvellous  point,  haft  and  gilding,  it  was  composed  of  the  essence 
of  all  the  elements  and  was  as  resplendent  as  the  sun.  Re- 
sembling the  Fire  of  Time  enveloped  in  smoke,  it  was  like  unto 
an  enormous  snake  and  was  capable  of  riving  men,  elephants, 
horses,  gateways,  bars  and  even  rocks.  Dreadful  to  behold, 
covered  with  blood  from  countless  victims,  coated  with  their 
flesh  and  of  the  temper  of  lightning,  it  emitted  a  thunderous 
3M 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

sound.  The  disperser  of  hosts,  it  created  universal  alarm,  and 
hissing  like  a  great  serpent,  it  was  exceedingly  formidable.  In 
war,  it  was  the  provider  of  nourishment  to  herons,  vultures, 
cranes  and  hordes  of  jackals  ;  it  was  a  form  of  death  itself,  the 
sower  of  terror,  the  delight  of  the  monkeys,  the  scourge  of  the 
titans  and  its  wings  were  composed  of  innumerable  brightly 
coloured  plumes,  like  unto  Garuda's. 

That  marvellous  and  powerful  shaft  that  was  to  destroy  the 
titan  was  the  object  of  terror  to  the  worlds,  the  remover  of  the 
fear  of  the  supporters  of  the  Ikshvakus,  the  depriver  of  the  glory 
of  the  foe,  and  it  filled  Rama  with  delight.  Having  charged  it 
with  the  sacred  formula,  the  valiant  Rama  of  indescribable 
prowess  placed  that  excellent  weapon  on  his  bow  according  to 
the  method  prescribed  by  the  Veda  and,  when  he  made  ready,  all 
beings  were  seized  with  terror  and  the  earth  shook.  Enraged,  he 
stretched  his  bow  with  force  and,  deploying  his  whole  strength, 
discharged  that  weapon,  the  destroyer  of  the  vital  parts,  on 
Ravana,  and  that  irresistible  shaft  like  unto  lightning,  irrevocable 
as  fate,  loosed  by  the  arm  of  one  equal  to  the  God  who  bears  the 
Thunderbolt,  struck  Ravana's  breast.  Loosed  with  exceeding 
force,  that  missile,  the  supreme  destroyer,  pierced  the  breast  of 
the  wicked-hearted  titan  and,  covered  with  blood,  that  fatal  dart 
having  extinguished  his  vital  breaths,  buried  itself  in  the  earth. 
Thereafter,  having  slain  Ravana,  that  shaft,  stained  with  blood 
which  dripped  therefrom,  its  purpose  accomplished,  returned 
submissively  to  the  quiver. 

And  Dashagriva,  who  had  been  struck  down  suddenly,  let  his 
bow  and  arrow  fall  from  his  hand  as  he  yielded  up  his  breath. 
Bereft  of  life,  that  Indra  of  the  Nairritas  of  redoubtable  valour 
and  great  renown,  fell  from  his  chariot  as  Vritra  when  struck  by 
Indra's  thunderbolt. 

Seeing  him  stretched  on  the  ground,  the  rangers  of  the  night 
who  had  escaped  the  carnage,  struck  with  terror,  their  sovereign 
being  slain,  fled  in  all  directions  and,  from  every  side,  the  monkeys 
who,  in  the  presence  of  the  dead  Dashagriva  had  assumed  a 
victorious  air,  hurled  themselves  upon  them,  armed  with  trees. 
Harassed  by  the  monkey  divisions,  the  titans,  terror-stricken, 
took  refuge  in  Lanka  and,  having  lost  their  lord,  in  despair,  gave 
way  to  tears. 

3*5 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

In  the  ranks  of  the  monkeys,  however,  there  arose  cries  of  joy 
and  shouts  of  triumph  proclaiming  Raghava's  victory  and 
Ravana's  defeat,  and  the  skies  re-echoed  to  the  music  of  the 
drums  beaten  by  the  Gods.  A  rain  of  flowers  fell  from  heaven 
on  to  the  earth,  covering  Raghava's  chariot  with  a  ravishing  and 
marvellous  shower  of  blossom.  The  cry  of '  Well  done !  Well 
done  ! '  came  from  the  firmament  and  the  celestial  voices  of  the 
magnanimous  Gods  were  raised  in  Rama's  praise.  On  the 
death  of  that  source  of  terror  to  all  the  worlds  a  great  joy  rilled 
the  Celestial  Host  as  also  the  Charanas. 

The  blessed  Raghava,  by  slaying  that  Bull  among  the  Titans, 
fulfilled  the  ambitions  of  Sugriva,  Angada  and  Bibishana; 
peace  reigned  over  all ;  the  cardinal  points  were  stilled ;  the 
air  became  pure,  the  earth  ceased  to  tremble,  the  wind  blew 
gently  and  the  star  of  the  day  regained  its  full  glory. 

At  that  instant,  Sugriva,  Bibishana  and  Angada,  the  foremost 
of  his  friends,  and  Lakshmana  also,  approached  that  happy 
conqueror  and  joyfully  offered  him  due  homage.  Rama,  the 
delight  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  surrounded  by  his  adherents  on 
the  battlefield,  having  slain  his  adversary  by  his  extraordinary 
power,  resembled  Mahendra  amidst  the  Celestial  Host. 


CHAPTER    III 

The  Lamentations  of  Bibishana 

Seeing  his  brother  defeated,  lying  on  the  battlefield,  Bibishana, 
his  heart  torn  with  violent  grief,  began  to  lament,  saying  : — 

"  O  Illustrious  Warrior,  thou  who  wert  renowned  for  thy 
skill,  experience  and  outstanding  courage,  even  among  the 
valiant,  O  Thou  accustomed  to  a  luxurious  couch,  how  is  it  that 
thou  art  lying  stiff  and  motionless,  thy  long  arms  adorned  with 
bracelets,  stretched  on  the  ground,  having  suffered  thy  diadem, 
the  lustre  of  which  equals  the  sun,  to  fall  on  the  earth  ?  O  Hero 
that  which  I  predicted  has  come  to  pass  I  Carried  away  by 
passion,  in  thy  presumption,  disregarding  my  counsel,  this  fate 
316 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

has  overtaken  Prahasta,  Indrajita,  Kumbhakarna,  Atiratha, 
Atikaya,  Narantaka,  and  thee  thyself.  Alas !  The  rampart  of 
the  virtuous  has  disappeared,  the  incarnation  of  duty  has  de- 
parted} the  refuge  of  the  strong  and  powerful  is  no  more.  The 
sun  has  fallen  to  earth,  the  moon  is  obscured  by  darkness ; 
fire  has  lost  its  brilliance,  energy  is  bereft  offeree,  since  that  hero, 
the  prince  of  warriors,  lies  stretched  on  the  earth.  What 
remains  now  that  he  is  deprived  of  his  might  and  that  tiger 
among  the  titans  lies  as  if  asleep  in  the  dust  ?  That  great  tree, 
the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  whose  stability  was  the  foliage,  his 
valour  the  blossom,  his  asceticism  the  sap,  his  heroism  the  inter- 
twining roots,  has  been  overthrown  on  the  battlefield  by  that 
tempest,  Raghava.  That  elephant  in  mustha,  Ravana,  his 
strength  the  tusks,  his  lineage  the  backbone,  his  exuberance  the 
trunk,  his  wrath  the  limbs,  has  been  seized  by  the  lion,  Ikshvaku. 
That  blazing  fire,  whose  prowess  and  energy  are  spreading 
flames,  his  angry  breathing  the  smoke,  his  martial  ardour  the 
heat,  has  been  extinguished  by  that  cloud,  Rama.  That  bull 
among  the  titans  with  the  Nairritas  as  his  tail,  hump  and  horns, 
his  love  of  pleasure  the  eyes  and  ears,  he  the  conquerer  of  his 
foes,  equal  to  the  wind  in  swiftness,  that  tiger  of  the  lords  of 
the  earth  is  lying  dead.*' 

Hearing  these  words,  full  of  good  sense  and  virtue,  uttered  by 
Bibishana  who  was  torn  with  grief,  Rama  addressed  him 
saying: — 

"  Nay,  this  hero  has  not  succumbed  on  account  of  his  lack  of 
prowess !  Endowed  with  burning  courage  in  battle,  having 
displayed  the  greatest  energy,  he  fell  without  yielding.  One 
should  not  mourn  for  those  who,  firm  in  their  duty  as  warriors, 
for  the  sake  of  renown  fall  on  the  field  of  battle.  It  is  not  the 
time  to  weep  for  this  brave  warrior,  the  terror  of  the  worlds  and 
their  leaders,  now  that  he  lies  under  the  sway  of  death ;  no  one 
is  always  victorious  in  war  ;  sometimes  the  brave  succumb  to 
the  blows  of  the  enemy  and  at  other  times  it  is  the  foe  who  is 
overcome  by  them.  This  path  followed  by  Ravana  was  taught 
to  us  by  the  Sages  and  the  warrior  class  hold  it  in  great  honour. 
The  warrior  who  is  shun  in  battle,  should  not  be  mourned,  this 
is  the  law.  In  this  conviction,  do  thy  duty  without  further 
anxiety  and  consider  what  action  should  now  be  taken."

Then  Bibishana,  who  was  overcome  with  grief,  instantly 
replied  to  that  noble  prince  who  had  spoken  to  him  in  his 
brother's  interest  and  said : — 

"  This  valiant  one  who,  in  previous  battles  was  never  defeated 
even  by  the  assembled  Gods  under  Vasava's  command,  assailed 
by  thee  on  the  field,  beheld  bis  power  shattered  as  the  ocean 
when  coming  in  contact  with  its  shores.  The  bestower  of  gins 
on  those  who  desired  them,  he  knew  how  to  enjoy  wealth  and 
entertain  those  who  served  him.  The  distributor  of  treasure 
amongst  his  friends,  he  suffered  his  wrath  to  fall  on  his  foes. 
Feeding  the  sacred  fire,  he  practiced  severe  penances,  was 
conversant  with  the  Veda  and  fulfilled  his  duty  as  a  real  hero. 
Now,  with  thine  approval,  I  desire  to  perform  bis  obsequies." 

Touched  by  these  poignant  words  of  Bibishana's,  Rama 
commanded  him  to  perform  the  funeral  rites  that  lead  the  soul 
to  heaven,  and  said  : — 

"  Death  has  terminated  our  emnity  that  now  has  no  reason  for 
its  existence.  He  is  as  dear  to  me  as  thee ;  let  us  therefore 
perform  the  obsequies  !  " 


CHAPTER     112 

The  Lamentations  of  Havana's  Consorts 

Hearing  that  Ravana  had  fallen  under  the  blows  of  the  highly 
powerful  Raghava,  the  female  titans,  like  unto  cows  which  have 
lost  their  calves,  overcome  with  grief,  their  hair  dishevelled, 
rushed  out  of  the  inner  apartments  and,  though  restrained, 
rolled  in  the  dust  again  and  again.  Issuing  from  the  northern 
gateway  with  their  attendants,  they  entered  that  dreadful 
battlefield  searching  for  their  dead  lord  and  cried  out,  *  O  Our 
King,  Our  Support  *,  running  hither  and  thither  on  the  ground 
that  was  covered  with  headless  trunks,  mud  and  gore.  Their 
eyes  full  of  tears,  overcome  with  grief,  they  emitted  cries  like 
unto  female  elephants  who  have  lost  the  leader  of  the  herd. 

Then  they  beheld  that  great  and  exceedingly  powerful  and 
illustrious  Ravana,  their  lord,  lying  in  the  dust  and  they  immedi- 
ately all  fell  upon  his  body  like  creepers  that  have  been  tors 
318 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

down  in  the  forest.  In  a  transport  of  passion,  one  embraced 
him  sobbing,  one  pressed  his  feet,  one  hung  on  his  neck,  whilst 
another,  beating  the  air  with  her  arms,  rolled  on  the  ground  and 
yet  another,  gazing  on  her  dead  lord,  swooned  away,  and  one, 
laying  her  head  in  his  lap,  wept  as  she  looked  on  him,  her  tears 
bathing  his  face,  as  rime  covers  a  lotus  flower. 

Beholding  their  lord  lying  stretched  on  the  earth,  in  their 
despair,  they  emitted  continual  cries  of  pain  as  their  lamentations 
increased — *  He  of  whom  Shakra  himself  stood  in  awe,  he  who 
was  the  source  of  terror  to  Yama,  he,  by  whom  the  King 
Vaishravana  was  dispossessed  of  his  Chariot  Pushpaka,  he,  who 
caused  the  Gandharvas,  Rishis,  and  the  magnanimous  Gods  to 
tremble,  is  now  lying  dead  on  the  field.  He  had  nought  to  fear 
from  Asuras,  Suras  or  Pannagas,  for  it  was  in  man  that  the  peril 
lay  for  him ;  he,  who  could  not  be  slain  by  Devatas,  Danavas 
or  Rakshasas  is  lying  here  on  the  earth,  struck  down  by  a  mere 
mortal  fighting  on  foot ;  he,  who  could  not  be  slain  by  Suras, 
Yakshas  or  Asuras,  received  bis  death  blow  from  a  man,  as  one 
who  is  defenceless.' 

Thus  did  the  wretched  consorts  of  Ravana  speak  amidst  their 
sobs  and,  overwhelmed  with  grief,  continued  to  lament  without 
ceasing,  saying  : — 

"  Not  heeding  the  advice  of  thy  friend,  who  ever  offered  thee 
prudent  counsel,  to  our  destruction  thou  didst  bear  Sita  away 
and  thus  the  titans  have  fallen  and  we  shall  perish  this  day  on 
account  of  thy  fault.  Thy  beloved  brother,  Bibishana,  speaking 
to  thee  in  reasonable  terms  was  publicly  affronted  by  thee  in  thy 
folly,  driven  on,  as  thou  wert  by  destiny ;  if  thou  hadst  returned 
the  Princess  of  Mithila  to  Rama,  this  fearful  and  appalling 
disaster,  that  is  destroying  us  to  the  very  root,  would  never  have 
taken  place.  The  wishes  of  thy  brother,  of  Rama  and  of  thine 
innumerable  friends  would  have  been  fulfilled ;  none  of  us 
would  have  been  widowed  nor  the  hopes  of  our  enemies  accom- 
plished. But,  in  thy  perversity,  having  retained  Sita  by  force, 
the  titans,  we  ourselves  and  thou  thyself,  are  all  victims  of  a  triple 
destruction.  Nevertheless,  O  Bull  among  the  Titans,  it  is  not 
thy  passion  that  is  the  cause  but  destiny  ;  all  that  dies  is  slain  by 
destiny.  This  destruction  of  the  monkeys  and  the  titans  in 
combat  and  thine  own,  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  is  the  work  of 
319 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

destiny.   Neither  the  considerations  of  wealth,  desire,  valour  nor 
dominion  can  avert  the  course  of  destiny !  " 

Thus  the  wretched  consorts  of  the  King  of  the  Titans  lamen- 
ted like  ospreys,  overwhelmed  by  grief,  their  eyes  full  of  tears. 


CHAPTER    113 

The  Lamentations  of  Mandodari  :  Havana's  Funeral  Rites 

While  the  consorts  of  Ravana  were  lamenting  thus,  the  foremost 
amongst  them  steadily  fixed  on  him  a  tender  and  sorrowful 
glance  and,  in  the  presence  of  her  lord,  Dasbagriva,  who  had 
been  slain  by  Rama  of  inconceivable  exploits,  the  unfortunate 
Mandodari  expressed  her  grief  in  this  wise : — 

"  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  younger  brother  of  Vaishravana, 
did  not  Purandara  himself  fear  to  stand  before  thee  in  thy  wrath 
and  did  not  the  great  Rishis  and  the  illustrious  Gandharvas  as  also 
the  Charanas,  assailed  by  thee,  flee  to  every  quarter  ?  Now 
Rama,  who  is  but  a  mortal,  has  defeated  thee  in  combat,  thou 
who  didst  surpass  the  Three  Worlds  in  prowess ;  thou  whose 
strength  rendered  thee  invincible,  how  is  it  that  thou  hast  fallen 
under  the  blows  of  a  mere  man,  a  wanderer  in  the  forest  ?  Thou , 
able  to  assume  any  form  at  will,  living  in  a  place  inaccessible  to 
man,  how  can  thy  defeat  by  Rama  be  explained  ? 

"  Nay,  I  do  not  believe  that  thou  wast  thus  struck  down  in  the 
forefront  of  the  battle  by  Rama's  action,  thou  who  wert  ever 
wont  to  be  victorious  in  all  circumstances.  Rather,  having 
recourse  to  inconceivable  magic,  was  it  destiny  in  the  form  of 
Rama  in  person  or  it  may  be  that  it  was  Vasava  who  slew  thee,  O 
Mighty  Hero  !  But  would  Vasava  have  ventured  to  stand  face 
to  face  with  thee  on  the  battlefield  in  view  of  thy  great  prowess 
and  strength,  thou  the  foe  of  the  Celestials  ?  Assuredly  it  was 
that  great  Yogi,  the  Supreme  Soul,  the  Eternal  Spirit  Who  was 
thy  slayer.  He  who  has  no  beginning,  middle  or  end,  the  Most 
High,  greater  that  Mahat,1  the  Support  of  Nature,  He  Who 
carries  the  conch,  the  discus  and  the  mace,  Whose  breast  bears 
1  Mahat— Connie  Intellect, 

3*0 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

the  Shrivatsa  Mark,  to  Whom  prosperity  belongs,  the  invincible, 
indestructible,  everlasting  Vishnu,  the  true  Hero  assuming 
human  form  surrounded  by  all  the  Gods  in  monkey  shapes,  He, 
the  Lord  of  the  Worlds,  has  slain  thee,  thou,  the  enemy  of  the 
Gods,  with  thy  kinsmen  and  the  titans  who  attended  on  thee ! 

"  Formerly,  having  subdued  the  senses,  thou  didst  conquer 
the  Three  Worlds  and  thereafter  thy  senses  conquered  thee  in 
their  turn.  Rama  is  no  mere  mortal ;  once  in  Janasthana  he 
slew  thy  brother  Khara  and  the  innumerable  titans  who  followed 
him ;  furthermore  when  Hanuman  audaciously  penetrated  into 
the  City  of  Lanka,  inaccessible  to  the  Gods  themselves,  we  were 
sorely  distressed.  How  oft  did  I  address  thee,  saying, '  Have  we 
nought  to  fear  from  Raghava ',  but  thou  didst  not  heed  me. 
These  are  the  consequences  !  Without  cause  thou  didst  cherish 
a  passion  for  Sita,  O  King  of  the  Titans,  to  the  destruction  of  thy 
kingdom,  life  and  race !  By  offering  insult  to  the  illustrious 
Sita,  who  surpasses  Arundhati  and  Rohini,  thou  didst  commit  an 
unpardonable  offence !  She  is  more  patient  than  the  earth 
itself,  the  prosperity  of  prosperity  itself,  the  beloved  consort  of 
Rama,  of  faultless  limbs,  who  was  the  splendour  of  the  lonely 
forest  where  she  dwelt.  By  bearing  that  unfortunate  one  away, 
assuming  a  disguise  and  without  being  able  to  enjoy  the  antici- 
pated delight  of  union  with  Maithili,  thou  hast  brought  about 
thine  own  destruction ! 

"  O  My  Lord,  the  asceticism  of  that  lady  faithful  to  her 
husband,  has  consumed  thee !  Since  all  the  Gods  and  their 
leaders  with  Agni  at  their  head  feared  thee,  thou  wast  not 
instantly  destroyed  when  thou  didst  lay  brutal  hands  on  that 
slender-waisted  lady.  But,  0  Lord,  when  the  time  is  ripe,  the 
one  who  acts  wickedly  reaps  the  fruit  of  his  evil  actions  ;  of  that 
there  is  no  doubt.  He  who  behaves  virtuously  culls  felicity  and 
he  who  acts  sinfully  reaps  ill-fortune.  Bibishana  has  found 
happiness  and  thou  in  the  same  wise  has  met  with  disaster.  Thou 
didst  possess  other  women  who  surpassed  Maithili  in  beauty 
but  in  thine  infatuation  thou  didst  not  perceive  it.  None  dies 
without  a  determining  cause,  for  thee  it  was  none  other  than  Sita. 
Far  didst  thou  go  to  seek  that  woman  who  was  to  be  the  reason 
of  thy  death ;  now  Maithili,  released  from  all  her  sufferings,  will 
rejoice  with  Rama.  Trifling  indeed  is  my  merit,  since  I  have

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

fallen  into  this  ocean  of  grief,  I  who  formerly  sported  on  Mount 
Kailasha,  Mandara  and  Meru  and  in  the  woods  of  Chaitaratha 
and  all  the  gardens  of  the  Gods  with  thee,  being  adorned  with 
marvellous  garlands  and  jewels,  roaming  at  large  in  a  chariot  of 
incomparable  magnificence,  beholding  innumerable  countries, 
whilst  now  I  am  deprived  of  all  pleasures  and  enjoyments  by  thy 
death,  O  Hero  !  Here  am  I,  transformed  as  it  were  into  another ; 
condemned  on  account  of  the  fluctuations  of  the  fortunes  of 
kings.  O  Prince,  how  gracious  wert  thou  with  thy  charming 
eyebrows,  brilliant  complexion  and  arched  nose ;  thou  whose 
beauty,  splendour  and  radiance  rivalled  the  moon,  the  lotus 
and  the  sun ;  dazzling  with  innumerable  diadems  and  varie- 
gated garlands,  thy  red  lips  and  brilliant  earrings ;  handsome 
and  pleasing,  whose  glances,  misty  with  wine,  roved  here  and 
there  in  the  banqueting  hall,  conversing  with  tender  smiles  ! 
Alas  to-day  thy  countenance  has  lost  its  radiance,  O  King, 
mutilated  as  thou  art  by  Rama's  shafts,  red  with  blood,  covered 
with  flesh  and  brains  and  soiled  with  the  dust  of  chariots.  Ah ! 
the  final  period  of  my  life  has  come ;  the  sad  state  of  widowhood  ! 
Wretched  being  that  I  am,  I  never  contemplated  this !  '  My 
rather  is  the  King  of  the  Danavas,  my  consort  the  Lord  of  the 
Titans,  my  son  the  Conqueror  of  Shakra  !  I  have  nought  to  fear 
with  such  protectors  who  crush  the  arrogance  of  their  foes,  who 
are  terrible  and  renowned  for  their  might  and  courage,'  thus  did 
I  speak  in  my  pride.  With  such  a  power  as  thou  possessed,  O 
Bull  among  Titans,  how  has  so  great  a  disaster  overtaken  thee 
suddenly,  through  a  mere  man  ?  Thou  wert  like  a  marvellous 
sapphire,  enormous,  like  unto  a  mountain  and  dazzling  with  thy 
rings,  bracelets,  chains  of  emeralds  and  pearls  and  thy  flowery 
garlands ;  full  of  gaiety  in  pastimes  and  enjoyments.  Thy 
body,  that  shone  with  the  lustre  of  thine  ornaments,  as  a  cloud 
riven  with  lightning,  is  now  pierced  by  many  arrows,  ill-fitted  to 
be  embraced,  without  a  space  that  is  not  bristling  with  darts,  like 
unto  an  hedgehog,  the  muscles  torn  with  shafts  loosed  with 
violence  on  thy  vital  parts,  a  corpse,  lying  on  the  earth,  that  was 
formerly  dark  in  hue  and  is  now  the  colour  of  blood,  O  King  ! 
Alas !  That  which  seemed  a  dream  has  now  become  a  reality  1 
How  was  Rama  able  to  strike  thee  down,  thou  who  wert  death  to 
Death  himself;  whence  comes  it  that  thou  hast  fallen  under  his 
322 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

sway,  thou  who  enjoyed  the  wealth  of  the  Three  Worlds 
whom  thou  didst  inspire  with  a  lively  fear ;  thou  who  conquered 
the  Guardians  of  the  Worlds,  who  overcame  Shankara  with  thy 
shafts,  who  didst  humble  the  proud  and  manifest  thy  great 
prowess.  Thou  who  didst  trouble  the  universe,  the  scourge  of  the 
virtuous,  whose  strength  inspired  thee  to  utter  insolent  threats 
in  the  enemy's  presence ;  thou  the  support  of  thy  family  and 
thine  attendants,  the  slayer  of  redoubtable  warriors,  thou  who 
exterminated  the  leaders  of  the  Danavas  and  Yakshas  in  their 
thousands,  thou  who  triumphed  in  the  fight  over  those  wearing 
impenetrable  armour,  thou  who  many  a  time  obstructed  the 
sacrifices,  thou  the  saviour  of  thy  race,  who  set  at  nought  the  laws 
of  duty,  who  took  refuge  in  the  power  of  magic  in  battle,  who 
robbed  the  Gods,  Asuras  and  men  of  their  daughters  from  here 
and  there  and  who  didst  plunge  the  wives  of  thy  foes  into 
mourning ;  thou,  the  guide  of  thy  people,  who  ruled  over  the 
Island  of  Lanka,  thou  the  perpetrator  of  dreadful  deeds,  thou 
who  didst  prepare  for  us  many  a  pleasure  and  enjoyment,  thou 
the  foremost  of  warriors ;  beholding  thee,  O  Lord,  who  despite 
thy  great  powers,  hast  been  struck  down  by  Rama,  my  heart 
must  be  hard  indeed  that  I  yet  live  bereft  of  thee,  my  Beloved. 
Having  rested  on  sumptuous  couches,  O  King  of  the  Titans,  how 
is  it  that  thou  art  now  sleeping  on  the  earth,  the  dust  thy 
coverlet  ? 

"  When  mine  illustrious  son  Indrajita  was  struck  down  by 
Lakshmana  in  the  fight,  I  was  deeply  distressed  but  to-day  I  am 
undone,  I,  who,  already  bereft  of  parents  and  kinsfolk,  now  lose 
my  last  support  in  thee  I  Deprived  of  pleasure  and  enjoyments, 
now  that  thou  hast  left  on  the  last  journey  from  which  none 
returns,  O  King,  I  shall  waste  away  in  thy  perpetual  remem- 
brance. I  cannot  live  without  thee ;  take  me  with  thee ;  why 
dost  thou  leave  me  in  my  misery  ?  Art  thou  vexed  to  see  me 
unveiled  who  have  crossed  the  city  boundary  to  run  here  on  foot, 
O  Lord  ?  Look  on  thy  cherished  consorts  who  have  discarded 
their  veils ;  seeing  them  all  come  forth  from  the  city,  art  thou 
displeased  ?  This  company,  with  whom  thou  didst  disport 
thyself,  is  desolate,  deprived  of  its  leader  and  thou  dost  not 
comfort  them.  Hast  thou  no  reverence  for  us  ?  Those  women 
whom  thou  hast  widowed,  O  King,  and  more  than  one  was  of 
3*3 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

noble  lineage,  who  were  devoted  to  their  consorts,  firm  in  their 
duty  and  submissive  to  their  Gurus,  in  their  grief  have  cursed 
thee  and,  on  this  account,  thou  hast  fallen  under  the  blows  of 
thine  adversary.  Stricken  by  thee,  they  have  cursed  thee  and  this 
is  the  retribution  !  O  King,  the  truth  of  die  saying,  The  tears 
of  women  devoted  to  their  husbands  do  not  tall  on  the  earth  in 
vain  ',  has  been  proven  by  thee  !  How  comes  it,  O  King,  that 
thou,  who  didst  surpass  all  the  worlds  in  valour,  wert  so  base  as 
to  carry  off  this  woman,  having  lured  Rama  from  the  hermitage 
with  the  aid  of  an  illusory  deer  ?  In  the  intoxication  of  thy 
strength  thou  didst  bear  away  Rama's  consort  after  separating 
her  from  Lakshmana,  and  yet,  if  I  reflect  carefully,  thou  wert 
never  a  faint-hearted  warrior  !  This  is  the  manifest  proof  of  the 
changeability  of  fortune.  Conversant  with  the  past  and  future 
and  reflecting  on  the  present,  that  long-armed  warrior,  my 
truthful  brother-in-law,1  seeing  Maithili,  whom  thou  hadst 
borne  away,  sighing  deeply,  told  me  what  had  taken  place.  The 
destruction  of  the  foremost  of  the  titans  has  been  brought  about 
by  this  infatuation  which  was  the  source  of  thy  lust  and  anger. 
Thou  didst  sacrifice  thy  real  interests  to  this  violent  appetite  that 
destroys  everything  to  its  very  roots  and,  by  this  action,  the  whole 
titan  race  is  deprived  of  its  leader. 

"  Nay,  I  should  not  weep  for  thee,  though  famed  for  thy 
strength  and  valour  but  my  woman's  nature  inclines  my  heart  to 
compassion.  Bearing  with  thee  the  sum  of  that  which  thou  hast 
done,  be  it  good  or  ill,  thou  hast  gone  to  the  place  for  which  thou 
wert  destined  ;  it  is  for  myself  I  should  lament,  I  who  am  plunged 
in  affliction  by  thy  loss. 

"  Thou  didst  not  give  ear  to  thy  friends  who  desired  thy 
welfare  and,  though  exceedingly  sagacious,  thou  didst  ignore  the 
counsels  of  thy  brothers,  O  Ten-necked  One.  Bibishana's 
words  so  full  of  reason,  that  were  measured,  prudent,  salutory 
and  affectionate  were  not  heeded  by  thee  despite  their  signifi- 
cance. Drunk  with  thine  own  power,  the  utterances  of  Marichi, 
Kumbhakarna  and  of  thy  sire  also,  were  not  acceptable  to  thee ; 
behold  the  consequences ! 

"  O  Thou  who  resemblest  a  dark  cloud  in  hue,  who  art  clothed 
in  yellow,  wearing  dazzling  bracelets,  why  are  thy  limbs  stiff 

3*4 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

and  covered  with  blood  ?  Thou  fcignest  sleep ;  why  dost  thou 
not  answer  me  who  am  overcome  with  grief?  Why  dost  thou 
not  speak  to  me,  the  daughter  of  the  supremely  powerful 
Yatudhana  Surnali,  who  never  retreated  in  battle?  Rise! 
Rise !  Why  dost  thou  remain  lying  there  in  the  face  of  this 
fresh  insult  ?  To-day  the  rays  of  the  sun  fall  on  Lanka  without 
fear.  Thy  mace,  that  brilliant  weapon  encircled  with  gold,  like 
unto  Surya,  with  which  thou  didst  exterminate  thy  foes  in 
battle,  resembling  the  thunderbolt  of  Indra,  which  thou  didst 
wield  at  thy  whim  to  the  destruction  of  the  many  on  the  battle- 
field, now  Lies  shattered  in  a  thousand  pieces  by  Rama's  arrows. 
Why  dost  thou  lie  embracing  the  earth  like  a  loved  one  ?  How 
is  it  that  thou  dost  not  address  a  word  to  me  as  if  I  were  no 
longer  thy  beloved  ? 

"  Woe  unto  me,  whose  heart  did  not  split  into  a  thousand 
pieces,  riven  by  grief,  when  thou  didst  return  to  the  five 
elements!" 

Thus  did  Mandodari  lament,  her  eyes  full  of  tears ;  and 
thereafter  her  heart  overflowing  with  love,  she  swooned  away, 
falling  unconscious  on  Ravana's  breast,  like  a  flash  of  lightning 
striking  a  crimson  cloud  at  dusk.  Thereupon  her  companions, 
distressed,  raised  up  her  who  was  lamenting  and  placing  her  in 
their  midst,  said  : — 

"  O  Queen,  art  thou  not  conversant  with  the  uncertainty  of 
fate  in  this  world  and  how,  in  a  moment,  the  fortune  of  kings  may 
change?" 

To  these  words,  Mandodari  replied  with  sobs  and  cries,  her 
pure  and  lovely  face  and  her  breast  bathed  in  tears. 

Then  Rama  said  to  Bibishana  : — 

"  Proceed  with  the  obsequies  of  thy  brother  and  offer  conso- 
lation to  his  wives  !  *' 

Thereafter  the  sagacious  Bibishana,  having  reflected  within 
himself,  made  this  answer  that  was  discreet,  reasoned  and  in 
conformity  with  duty  and  understanding,  saying  : — 

"  I  cannot  perform  the  funeral  rites  for  one  who  failed  to 
fulfil  his  responsibilities  and  his  vows,  who  was  cruel,  ruthless 
and  disloyal ;  a  ravisher  of  others  wives  1  Under  the  guise  of  a 
brother  he  was  mine  enemy  and  took  pleasure  in  inflicting  injury ;

*  he  was  a  barbarian  ',  but  when  they  learn  of  Ravana's  wicked 
deeds,  everyone  will  approve  my  conduct." 

Thus  did  he  speak,  and  Rama,  full  of  joy,  the  foremost  of 
those  who  are  firm  in  their  duty,  answered  Bibishana,  who  was 
skilled  in  speech,  saying : — 

"  I  seek  thy  welfare,  since  with  thine  aid  I  have  been  victorious, 
nevertheless  it  is  essential  that  I  should  utter  what  is  fitting,  O 
Chief  of  the  Titans  !  Though  unjust  and  wicked,  this  night- 
ranger  was  ever  energetic,  valiant  and  courageous  in  war.  It  is 
said  that  the  Gods  with  Shatakratu  at  their  head  were  not  able 
to  overcome  him.  He  was  magnanimous  and  powerful,  this 
oppressor  of  the  worlds.  Death  brings  enmity  to  an  end ;  we 
have  accomplished  our  purpose,  let  us  perform  the  obsequies  ; 
it  is  meet  for  me,  as  well  as  for  thee,  to  do  so.  In  accord  with 
tradition,  this  ceremony  should  take  place  in  thy  presence. 
Perform  this  pious  act  speedily,  thou  wilt  receive  much  glory 
therefrom." 

At  these  words  of  Raghava,  Bibishana  hastened  to  carry  out 
the  funeral  rites. 

Entering  the  City  of  Lanka,  that  Indra  among  the  Titans, 
Bibishana,  began  to  prepare  for  the  Agnihotra  Ceremony  in 
honour  of  his  brother.  Carts,  wood  of  varying  essences,  fire, 
utensils,  sandal,  logs  of  every  kind,  fragrant  gums,  perfumes, 
cloths,  jewels,  pearls  and  coral  were  all  assembled  by  him  and  he 
soon  returned  surrounded  by  titans,  whereupon,  accompanied 
by  Malyavan,1  he  initiated  the  sacrifice. 

Having  placed  Ravana,  the  supreme  Lord  of  the  Titans, 
wrapped  in  linen  cloths  on  a  golden  bier,  the  Twice-born  with 
Bibishana  at  their  head,  their  eyes  suffused  with  tears,  raised  the 
Utter  decorated  with  many  fragrant  and  divine  symbols  to  the 
sound  of  innumerable  musical  instruments  and  funeral  chants, 
and  all,  turning  their  faces  towards  the  south,  took  up  pieces  of 
wood  which  had  been  distributed  among  them. 

Then  the  brahmins,  versed  in  the  Yajur  Veda,  bearing  naming 
brands  went  forward  and  those  who  had  taken  refuge  with  them, 
and  the  women  of  the  inner  apartments  followed  sobbing  with 
tottering  steps,  running  hither  and  thither.  And  Ravana  was 
placed  in  a  spacious  ground,  amidst  profound  lamentation,  and  a 

*  Malyavan — The  brother  of  Stiraali.

great  pyre  was  built  with  pieces  of  Sandal  and  Padmaka  Wood 
and  grass,  according  to  tradition ;  and  he  was  covered  with 
antelope  skins. 

Thereafter,  in  honour  of  the  King  of  the  Titans,  a  rare  offering 
was  made  to  the  ancestors  and  the  altar  was  installed  to  the 
south-west  with  the  sacred  fire  in  its  proper  place.  Then  curd 
and  clarified  butter  were  poured  on  Havana's  shoulder  and  a 
wooden  mortar  placed  at  his  feet  with  one  between  his  thighs ; 
vessels  of  wood  and  the  lower  and  upper  kindling  sticks,  with  a 
spare  pestle,  were  set  there  according  to  the  prescribed  rules. 
Now  the  titans  sacrificed  a  goat  in  honour  of  their  king,  according 
to  tradition,  as  taught  by  the  great  Risbis,  and,  having  dipped  a 
cloth  in  butter,  they  covered  the  face  of  their  sovereign,  who  was 
adorned  with  garlands  and  sprinkled  with  perfumes.  Thereafter 
Bibishana's  companions,  their  faces  bathed  in  tears,  covered  the 
body  with  cloths  and  every  kind  of  roasted  grain,  whereupon 
Bibishana  kindled  the  pyre  according  to  the  sacred  rites  and, 
having  laved  him  with  a  doth  which  had  been  previously 
wetted  with  water  and  mingled  with  linseed  and  sacrificial  grass, 
he  bowed  down  to  him ;  then  he  addressed  the  consorts  of 
Ravana  again  and  again  in  order  to  console  them,  finally  en- 
treating them  to  return  home.  And  when  they  had  all  re- 
entered the  City  of  Lanka,  that  Indra  among  the  Titans  took 
up  bis  place  by  Rama  in  an  attitude  of  reverence. 

Rama,  however,  with  his  army,  Sugriva  and  Lakshmana, 
rejoiced  at  the  death  of  his  enemy,  as  the  God  who  bears  the 
Thunderbolt  on  the  destruction  of  Vritra. 

Having  laid  aside  the  arrows  and  bow  that  Mahendra  had 
bestowed  upon  him  as  also  the  massive  armour,  Rama,  the  slayer 
of  his  foes,  renounced  his  wrath,  his  adversary  having  been 
subdued,  and  once  more  assumed  a  gentle  mien.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    1X4 

Bibishana  is  installed  as  King  of  Lanka 

Having  witnessed  the  death  of  Ravana,  the  Devas,  Gandharvas 
and  Danavas  mounted  their  respective  chariots,  discoursing  on 
these  matters.  Conversing  of  Ravana's  fearful  end,  the  heroism 
of  Raghava,  the  courageous  fighting  of  the  monkeys,  the  great 
valour  of  Maruti  and  Lakshmana  and  Sita's  fidelity  to  her  lord, 
those  blessed  ones  returned  joyfully  from  whence  they  had  come. 

Raghava,  however,  sent  back  the  celestial  chariot  blazing  like 
a  name  that  Indra  had  lent  him  and  took  leave  of  Matali  after 
offering  his  thanks  to  him.  Then  Shakra's  charioteer,  dismissed 
by  the  mighty  Rama,  mounting  his  celestial  car,  ascended  into 
the  sky. 

Matali  having  returned  to  heaven  in  his  chariot,  Raghava,  the 
foremost  of  car-warriors,  in  the  height  of  felicity,  embraced 
Sugriva  and,  having  done  so,  accepted  Lakshmana's  homage  and 
returned  to  the  camp  amidst  the  acclamations  of  the  monkey  ranks. 

Thereafter  Kakutstha  addressed  the  son  of  Sumitra,  the 
devoted  Lakshmana,  the  bearer  of  auspicious  marks,  who  stood 
near  him  and  said  : — 

"  O  Friend,  install  Bibishana  as  King  of  Lanka  !  On  account 
of  his  loyalty,  his  zeal  and  the  service  he  formerly  rendered  to  us, 
my  greatest  desire  is  to  see  Bibishana,  the  younger  brother  of 
Ravana  enthroned  in  Lanka,  O  Dear  One." 

At  these  words  from  the  magnanimous  Raghava,  Saumitri, 
full  of  joy,  said : — "  So  be  it !  "  and  speedily  took  up  a  golden 
jar  which  he  placed  in  the  hands  of  the  foremost  of  monkeys. 
Thereafter  that  warrior  commanded  water  to  be  drawn  from  the 
four  seas  and  the  monkeys  went  there  in  all  haste  and,  having 
drawn  water  from  the  oceans,  returned  as  swiftly  as  thought. 

Then  Saumitri,  at  Rama's  command,  lifting  up  an  excellent 
jar,  caused  Bibishana  to  take  his  place  on  a  high  seat  and, 
following  the  injunctions  laid  down  in  the  sacred  texts,  sur- 
rounded by  a  crowd  of  his  friends,  with  that  water  installed  him 
as  King  of  Lanka  amidst  the  titans. 
3*8 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

All  the  monkeys  as  well  as  the  titans  assisted  at  Bibishana's 
installation  and,  amidst  unequalled  transports  of  delight,  they 
paid  tribute  to  Rama.  Bibishana's  counsellors  were  exceedingly 
happy,  as  also  the  titans  who  were  devoted  to  him  and,  being 
enthroned  as  King  of  Lanka,  he,  Raghava  and  Lakshmana,  who 
accompanied  him,  experienced  supreme  satisfaction.  Then  the 
new  monarch,  having  spoken  graciously  to  his  subjects,  went  to 
where  Rama  was  to  be  found. 

Thereafter  the  people  of  the  city  offered  him  curds,  parched 
rice,  sweetmeats,  roasted  grain  and  flowers,  which  he  placed  at 
the  disposal  of  Rama  and  Lakshmana,  and  Raghava,  seeing 
Bibishana's  work  accomplished  and  his  purpose  attained, 
accepted  all  in  deference  to  him. 

Then  Rama  addressed  the  valiant  Hanuman,  who  resembled  a 
mountain,  as  he  stood  before  him  with  bowed  head  and  joined 
palms,  saying : — 

"  With  the  approval  of  the  great  King  Bibishana,  O  My 
Friend,  do  thou  re-enter  Lanka  and  enquire  for  Maithili.  Say 
to  Vaidehi  that  I  am  well,  as  also  Sugriva  and  Lakshmana.  0 
Most  Eloquent  of  Speakers,  tell  her  of  the  death  of  Ravana  on 
the  field  of  battle.  Impart  these  agreeable  tidings  to  Vaidehi,  O 
Prince  of  the  Monkeys,  and  having  received  her  commands, 
return !  " 


CHAPTER     ZI5 

Hanuman  carries  Rama's  Message  to  Sita 

Thus  commanded,  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta,  returned  to 
Lanka  overwhelmed  with  honours  by  the  rangers  of  the  night  and, 
entering  the  city  invested  with  Bibishana's  authority  which  he  had 
sought,  Hanuman  penetrated  to  the  Ashoka  Grove,  knowing  that 
Sita  was  to  be  found  there. 

There  he  beheld  Maithili  like  an  anguished  Rohini,  uncared 
for,  sitting  sorrowfully  at  the  foot  of  a  tree  surrounded  by  female 
titans  and,  approaching  her  humbly  and  gently,  Hanuman 
inclined  his  head  in  obeisance  to  her. 
329 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

At  the  appearance  of  the  mighty  Hanuman,  that  Goddess 
remained  silent,  but  thereafter,  having  recognized  him,  she  was 
delighted,  and  marking  her  tranquil  looks,  Hanuman  the  fore- 
most of  monkeys,  prepared  to  relate  all  that  Rama  had  said  : — 

"  O  Vaidehi,  Rama  is  well  as  also  Sugriva  and  Lakshmana ; 
he  enquires  as  to  thy  welfare  !  His  purpose  is  accomplished,  he, 
the  conquerer  of  his  foes  has  slain  his  adversary.  Assisted  by 
Bibishana  and  the  monkeys,  Rama,  with  the  skill  and  wisdom  of 
Lakshmana,  has  slain  Ravana  despite  his  prowess,  O  Goddess ! 
These  are  pleasant  tidings  but  I  will  delight  thee  still  further,  O 
Divinity.  In  this  war,  undertaken  on  thine  account,  O  Virtuous 
Sita,  Rama  has  achieved  a  great  triumph  !  Take  heart  therefore, 
have  no  further  anxiety ;  Ravana  is  dead  and  Lanka  subdued. 
Banishing  sleep,  I  resolved  to  deliver  thee  and  bridging  the  sea 
fulfilled  my  vow.  Do  not  fear  now  to  be  in  Ravana's  abode  since 
Bibishana  has  become  the  Lord  of  Lanka.  Because  of  this,  take 
courage,  thou  canst  dwell  peacefully  in  the  palace;  Rama 
himself  is  coming  hither  with  a  joyful  step  eager  to  see  thee." 

At  these  tidings,  the  divine  Sita,  her  face  radiant  as  the  moon 
on  account  of  joy,  was  unable  to  utter  a  single  word  and  that 
prince  of  monkeys  enquired  of  Sita,  who  remained  silent,  saying:— 

"  Of  what  art  thou  thinking,  O  Goddess,  since  thou  dost  not 
answer  me  ?  " 

Thus  interrogated  by  Hanuman,  Sita,  fixed  in  the  path  of 
duty,  in  the  height  of  joy,  said  in  a  voice  broken  with  sobs  : — 

"  Hearing  these  pleasant  tidings  of  the  triumph  of  my  lord, 
for  a  moment  joy  rendered  me  speechless.  Nay,  assuredly, 
reflecting  on  it,  O  Flavamgama,  I  do  not  know  what  gift  I  can 
offer  thee  which  would  be  equal  to  this  !  I  know  nothing  on 
earth  comparable  to  these  happy  tidings  or  with  what  I  can 
recompense  thee  fittingly.  Gold,  precious  gems  of  every  kind, 
even  a  throne  or  any  object  in  the  Three  Worlds  cannot  be 
measured  against  thy  message !  " 

At  these  words  of  Vaidehi,  the  monkey,  standing  before  her 
with  joined  palms,  joyfully  replied  : — 

"  O  Thou  who  art  ever  engaged  in  what  is  pleasant  and 
advantageous  to  thy  Lord  and  who  desirest  him  to  be  victorious, 
thine  affectionate  speech  confers  honour  on  thee,  O  Irreproach- 
able Lady." 

33° 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Hearing  this,  Maithili,  the  daughter  of  Janaka  addressed 
these  flattering  words  to  the  Son  of  the  Wind : — 

"  Thy  speech  which  is  characteristic,  urbane  and  dictated  by 
the  eight-fold  intelligence  is  worthy  of  thee.  Thou,  the  exceed- 
ingly virtuous  son  of  Anils  art  deserving  of  praise !  Assuredly 
strength,  prowess,  knowledge  of  the  scriptures,  courage* 
boldness,  superior  skill,  energy,  endurance,  steadiness,  con- 
stancy and  humility,  these  brilliant  qualities  and  many  others 
arc  all  to  be  found  in  thee  !  " 

Unmoved  by  this  praise,  Hamiman,  standing  before  her  with 
joined  palms,  addressed  Sita  respectfully  and  said : — 

"  With  thy  consent  I  will  slay  all  those  female  titans  who 
formerly  taunted  thee  in  thy  misfortune,  O  Thou  whose  lord  is 
a  god.  I  know  that  those  monsters  of  hideous  shape  and  con- 
duct, those  cruel  beings  of  savage  looks,  those  grim-visaged 
titans,  more  than  once  addressed  thee  in  threatening  tones  at 
Havana's  command.  Grant  me  permission  to  strike  down  those 
barbarians  of  distorted  features  and  fearful  aspect.  I  shall  beat 
them  with  my  fists,  heels,  long  arms,  thighs  and  knees ;  I  shall 
tear  them  to  pieces  with  my  teeth,  chew  up  their  ears,  pull  out 
their  hair,  knock  them  down  and  destroy  them,  since  they  have 
caused  thee  pain,  O  Illustrious  Princess !  I  shall  exterminate 
those  monsters  who  formerly  insulted  thee." 

Hearing  Hanuman's  words,  the  unfortunate  Sita,  friend  of  the 
distressed,  reflecting  carefully,  said  to  him : — 

"  Who  would  be  angry  with  women,  who  are  dependent  on  a 
monarch  who  is  their  supporter,  and  who  act  on  other's  advice 
as  mere  servants  or  slaves,  O  Excellent  Monkey  ?  All  that  has 
happened  to  me  is  on  account  of  an  evil  fate  and  the  consequence 
of  some  fault  committed  formerly.  One  reaps  the  fruit  of  one's 
actions.  Do  not  speak  thus,  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  the  path 
of  destiny  is  inexorable  !  It  was  inevitable  that  these  circum- 
stances should  overtake  me  and,  in  this  conviction,  I  wish  in 
compassion  to  protect  the  slaves  of  Havana.  It  was  under  the 
orders  of  that  titan  that  these  women  ill-treated  me.  He  being 
slain,  they  will  no  longer  oppress  me,  O  Son  of  Maruta.  There 
is  an  ancient  saying  full  of  wisdom  which  a  bear  uttered  formerly 
in  the  presence  of  a  tiger,  hear  it,  O  Plavamgama  ! 

"  'A  superior  being  does  not  render  evil  for  evil,  this  is  a 
331 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

maxim  one  should  observe ;  the  ornament  of  virtuous  persons  is 
their  conduct.  One  should  never  harm  the  wicked  or  the  good 
or  even  cruninals  meriting  death.  A  noble  soul  will  ever  exercise 
compassion  even  towards  those  who  enjoy  injuring  others  or 
those  of  cruel  deeds  when  they  are  actually  committing  them, 
who  is  without  fault  ? ' " 

Hearing  these  words,  Hanuman,  who  was  skilled  in  speech, 
said  to  Sita,  the  irreproachable  consort  of  Rama  : — 

"  Thou  art  worthy  of  Raghava,  thou,  bis  chaste  wife  crowned 
with  many  virtues.  O  Goddess,  command  me  to  seek  out 
Rama!" 

On  this,  Vaidehi  born  of  Janaka,  said  :  — 

"  I  desire  to  see  my  lord,  the  friend  of  his  devotees  !  " 

Hearing  her  speak  thus,  Hanuman,  the  exceedingly  intelligent 
son  of  Maruta  made  this  reply  to  Maithili,  causing  that  princess 
great  delight 

"  This  day  shalt  thou  see  Rama,  whose  countenance  resembles 
the  full  moon,  with  Lakshmana  and  his  trusted  friends,  his 
enemies  slain,  as  Sachi  looks  upon  Indra,  the  King  of  the  Gods." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Sita,  who  was  as  radiant  as  Shri 
herself,  the  exceedingly  valiant  Hanuman  immediately  departed 
to  rejoin  Raghava.  Without  delay,  the  foremost  of  monkeys, 
Hanuman,  repeated  the  words  that  the  daughter  of  Janaka  had 
uttered,  in  their  proper  sequence  to  Rama  who  was  the  equal  of 
the  Chief  of  the  Gods. 


CHAPTER     I  I  6 

Rama  sends  for  Sita 

That  highly  intelligent  monkey,  having  paid  obeisance  to  Rama, 
whose  eyes  resembled  the  petals  of  a  lotus,  the  most  skilled  of 
archers,  said  to  him : — 

"  It  behoveth  thee  to  visit  Maithili  who  is  consumed  with 

grief  and  on  account  of  whom  this  enterprise,  that  has  been 

crowned  with  success,  was  undertaken.     In  the  distress  that 

overwhelms  her,  Maithili,  her  eyes  bathed  in  tears,  hearing  of 

332 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

thy  victory,  expressed  a  desire  to  behold  thee  once  more. 
Confiding  in  me  formerly,  her  glances  warm  with  emotion,  she 
repeated  *  I  desire  to  see  my  lord  again !  *  " 

These  words  of  Hanuman  instantly  evoked  thoughts  in  Rama, 
the  first  of  men,  causing  him  to  shed  tears.  Sighing  deeply,  he 
said  to  Bibishana  standing  near,  who  resembled  a  cloud  : — 

"  Bring  the  Princess  of  Videha,  Sita,  hither,  anointed  with 
celestial  unguents,  adorned  with  heavenly  jewels,  having  laved 
her  head  ;  do  not  delay  !  " 

At  these  words  of  Rama,  Bibishana  hastened  to  the  private 
apartments  to  fetch  Sita  with  her  attendants.  Beholding  the 
unfortunate  Maithili,  Bibishana,  the  powerful  King  of  the  Titans, 
paid  obeisance  to  her,  raising  his  joined  palms  to  his  forehead, 
and  respectfully  addressed  her,  saying : — 

"  O  Vaidehi,  sprinkle  thyself  with  celestial  unguents,  adorn 
thyself  with  divine  ornaments  and  ascend  this  palanquin  !  May 
happiness  attend  thee  !    Thy  lord  desires  to  see  thee !  *' 

Then  Vaidehi  answered  Bibishana  who  had  addressed  her 
thus,  saying : — "  Without  having  bathed,  I  wish  to  see  my 
consort,  O  Bibishana." 

Hearing  this,  Bibishana  replied : — "  It  behoveth  thee  to  do 
what  Rama  commands  !  "  Whereto  the  virtuous  Maithili,  who 
regarded  her  husband  as  a  god,  filled  with  conjugal  duty,  said  : — 
*  Be  it  so  ! ' 

Thereupon  Sita,  her  tresses  waved,  adorned  with  priceless 
ornaments,  wearing  gorgeous  raiment,  ascended  a  palanquin 
borne  by  those  titans  accustomed  to  do  so,  accompanied  by  a 
large  escort  under  Bibishana's  command. 

And  Bibishana  approaching  that  magnanimous  hero,  who  was 
merged  in  meditation,  bowing  down  to  him,  joyfully  announced 
Sita's  arrival. 

Hearing  that  his  consort,  who  had  dwelt  long  in  the  titan's 
abode,  had  come,  rage,  joy  and  grief  overwhelmed  Raghava,  the 
slayer  of  his  toes  and,  beholding  Sita  in  the  palanquin,  Rama,  in 
order  to  test  her,  dissembling  his  happiness,  said  to  Bibishana : — 

"  O  Supreme  Lord  of  the  Titans,  O  My  Friend  who  ever 
rejoiced  in  my  victories,  bring  Vaidehi  nearer  to  me." 

At  Raghava's  command,  the  righteous  Bibishana  caused  the 
crowd  to  disperse,  whereupon  titans  clad  in  armour,  wearing 
333 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

turbans,  with  drums  and  bamboo  staves  in  their  hands  began  to 
move  about  driving  away  the  warriors,  bears,  monkeys  and 
titans,  who,  scattering,  stood  apart  some  way  off.  And  as  they 
were  being  driven  away,  a  tremendous  clamour  arose  resembling 
the  roar  of  the  sea  buffeted  by  the  winds. 

Seeing  them  dispersing,  whilst  confusion  was  created  amongst 
them,  Rama  in  affection  for  them,  grew  indignant  at  their 
departure  and,  highly  incensed,  with  a  glance  that  seemed  as  if 
it  would  consume  him,  addressed  the  exceedingly  intelligent 
Bibisbana  in  terms  of  reproach,  saying : — 

"  Why,  disregarding  me,  dost  thou  harass  them,  are  they  not 
my  people  ?  Her  conduct,  not  raiment,  walls,  seclusion  or  other 
royal  prohibitions,  are  a  woman's  shield.  In  times  of  calamity, 
peril,  war,  the  Swyamvara  or  the  nuptual  ceremony,  it  is  not 
forbidden  to  behold  a  woman  unveiled.  It  is  not  prohibited  to 
look  upon  a  woman  who  has  fallen  into  distress  and  difficulty, 
above  all  in  my  presence.  Therefore,  leaving  the  palanquin,  let 
Vaidehi  come  hither  on  foot  so  that  the  dwellers  in  the  woods 
may  see  her  at  my  side." 

Hearing  Rama's  words,  Bibishana  became  thoughtful  and 
conducted  Ska  to  him  reverently,  whilst  Lakshmana,  Sugriva  and 
also  Hanuman,  hearing  Rama  speak  thus,  were  saddened. 

Then  Maithili,  confused  and  shrinking  within  herself, 
approached  her  lord  accompanied  by  Bibishana  ;  and  it  was  with 
astonishment,  delight  and  love  that  Sita,  whose  husband  was  a 
god,  gazed  on  Rama's  gracious  appearance,  she  whose  own  face 
was  still  beautiful.  Beholding  the  countenance  of  her  dearly 
loved  lord,  whom  she  had  not  seen  for  so  long  and  which  was  as 
radiant  as  the  full  moon  when  it  rises,  she  cast  aside  all  anxiety 
and  her  own  face  became  as  fair  as  the  immaculate  orb  of  the

Rama  repudiates  Sita 

Beholding  Maithili  standing  humbly  beside  him,  Rama  gave 
expression  to  the  feelings  he  had  concealed  in  his  heart,  saying  : — 
"  O  Illustrious  Princess,  I  have  re-won  thee  and  mine  enemy 
334 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

has  been  defeated  on  the  battlefield ;  I  have  accomplished  all 
that  fortitude  could  do ;  my  wrath  is  appeased ;  the  insult  and 
the  one  who  offered  it  have  both  been  obliterated  by  me.  To-day 
my  prowess  has  been  manifested,  to-day  mine  exertions  have 
been  crowned  with  success,  to-day  I  have  fulfilled  my  vow  and 
am  free.  As  ordained  by  destiny  the  stain  of  thy  separation  and 
thine  abduction  by  that  fickle-minded  titan  has  been  expunged 
by  me,  a  mortal.  Of  what  use  is  great  strength  to  the  vacillating, 
who  do  not  with  resolution  avenge  the  insult  offered  to  them  ? 

"  To-day  Hanuman  is  plucking  the  fruit  of  his  glorious 
exploits,  and  Sugriva,  who  is  valiant  in  war  and  wise  in  counsel, 
with  his  army  is  reaping  the  harvest  of  his  exertions  !  Bibishana 
too  is  culling  the  fruits  of  his  labours,  he  who  cast  off  a  brother, 
who  was  devoid  of  virtue,  to  come  to  me." 

When  Sita  heard  Rama  speak  in  this  wise,  her  large  doe-like 
eyes  filled  with  tears  and,  beholding  the  beloved  of  his  heart 
standing  close  to  him,  Rama,  who  was  apprehensive  of  public 
rumour,  was  torn  within  himself.  Then,  in  the  presence  of  the 
monkeys  and  the  titans,  he  said  to  Sita,  whose  eyes  were  as  large 
as  lotus  petals,  her  dark  hair  plaited,  and  who  was  endowed  with 
faultless  limbs : — 

"  What  a  man  should  do  in  order  to  wipe  out  an  insult,  I  have 
done  by  slaying  Havana  for  I  guard  mine  honour  jealously ! 
Thou  wen  re-won  as  the  southern  region,  inaccessible  to  man, 
was  re-gained  by  the  pure-souled  Agastya  through  his  austerities. 
Be  happy  and  let  it  be  known  that  this  arduous  campaign,  so 
gloriously  terminated  through  the  support  of  my  friends,  was 
not  undertaken  wholly  for  thy  sake.  I  was  careful  to  wipe  out 
the  affront  paid  to  me  completely  and  to  avenge  the  insult 
offered  to  mine  illustrious  House. 

"A  suspicion  has  arisen,  however,  with  regard  to  thy  conduct, 
and  thy  presence  is  as  painful  to  me  as  a  lamp  to  one  whose  eye  is 
diseased !  Henceforth  go  where  it  best  pleaseth  thee,  I  give 
thee  leave,  O  Daughter  of  Janaka.  O  Lovely  One,  the  ten 
regions  are  at  thy  disposal ;  I  can  have  nothing  more  to  do  with 
thee !  What  man  of  honour  would  give  rein  to  his  passion  so  far 
as  to  permit  himself  to  take  back  a  woman  who  has  dwelt  in  the 
house  of  another  ?  Thou  hast  been  taken  into  Ravana's  lap  and 
he  has  cast  lustful  glances  on  thee;  how  can  I  reclaim  thee,  I  who 

335 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

boast  of  belonging  to  an  illustrious  House  ?  The  end  which  I 
sought  in  re-conquering  thee  has  been  gained  ;  I  no  longer  have 
any  attachment  for  thee ;  go  where  thou  desirest !  This  is  the 
outcome  of  my  reflections,  O  Lovely  One  !  Turn  to  Lakshmana 
or  Bharata,  Shatrughna,  Sugriva  or  the  Titan  Bibishana,  make 
thy  choice,  O  Sita,  as  pleases  thee  best.  Assuredly  Ravana, 
beholding  thy  ravishing  and  celestial  beauty,  will  not  have 
respected  thy  person  during  the  time  that  thou  didst  dwell  in 
his  abode." 

On  this,  that  noble  lady,  worthy  of  being  addressed  in  sweet 
words,  hearing  that  harsh  speech  from  her  beloved  lord,  who  for 
long  had  surrounded  her  with  every  homage,  wept  bitterly,  and 
she  resembled  a  creeper  that  has  been  torn  away  by  the  trunk  of 
a  great  elephant. 


CHAPTER    i i 8 

Sita's  Lamentations;  She  undergoes  the  Ordeal  by  Fire 

Hearing  these  harsh  words  from  the  wrathful  Raghava,  causing 
her  to  tremble,  those  fearful  utterances,  which  till  that  time  had 
never  been  heard  by  her  and  were  now  addressed  to  her  by  her 
lord  in  the  presence  of  a  great  multitude,  Maithili,  the  daughter 
of  Janaka,  overwhelmed  with  shame,  pierced  to  the  heart  by  that 
arrow-like  speech,  shed  abundant  tears.  Thereafter,  wiping  her 
face,  she  addressed  her  husband  in  gentle  and  faltering  accents, 
saying: — 

"  Why  dost  thou  address  such  words  to  me,  O  Hero,  as  a 
common  man  addresses  an  ordinary  woman  ?  I  swear  to  thee,  O 
Long-armed  Warrior,  that  my  conduct  is  worthy  of  thy  respect ! 
It  is  the  behaviour  of  other  women  that  has  rilled  thee  with 
distrust !  Relinquish  thy  doubts  since  I  am  known  to  thee !  If 
my  limbs  came  in  contact  with  another's,  it  was  against  my  will, 
O  Lord,  and  not  through  any  inclination  on  my  part ;  it  was 
brought  about  by  fate.  That  which  is  under  my  control,  my 
heart,  has  ever  remained  faithful  to  thee ;  my  body  was  at  the 
mercy  of  another ;  not  being  mistress  of  the  situation,  what  could 
33< 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

I  do  ?  If  despite  the  proofs  of  love  that  I  gave  thee  whilst  I  lived 
with  thee,  I  am  still  a  stranger  to  thee,  O  Proud  Prince,  my  loss  is 
irrevocable  1 

"When,  in  Lanka,  thou  didst  dispatch  the  great  warrior 
Hanuman  to  seek  me  out,  why  didst  thou  not  repudiate  me  then  ? 
As  soon  as  2  had  received  the  tidings  that  I  had  been  abandoned 
by  thee,  I  should  have  yielded  up  my  life  in  the  presence  of  that 
monkey,  O  Hero  !  Then  thou  wouldst  have  been  spared  useless 
fatigue  on  mine  account  and  others  lives  would  not  have  been 
sacrificed,  nor  thine  innumerable  friends  exhausted  to  no  purpose. 
But  thou,  O  Lion  among  Men,  by  giving  way  to  wrath  and  by 
thus  passing  premature  judgement  on  a  woman,  hast  acted  like 
a  worthless  man. 

"  I  have  received  my  name  from  Janaka,  but  my  birth  was  from 
the  earth  and  thou  hast  failed  to  appreciate  fully  the  nobility  of 
my  conduct,  O  Thou  who  are  well  acquainted  with  the  nature  of 
others.  Thou  hast  had  no  reverence  for  the  joining  of  our  hands 
in  my  girlhood  and  mine  affectionate  nature,  all  these  things  hast 
thou  cast  behind  thee !  " 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Rama,  weeping  the  while,  her  voice 
strangled  with  sobs,  Sita  addressed  the  unfortunate  Lakshmana, 
who  was  overwhelmed  with  grief,  saying  : — 

"  Raise  a  pyre  for  me,  O  Saumitri,  this  is  the  only  remedy  for 
my  misery  !  These  unjust  reproaches  have  destroyed  me,  I 
cannot  go  on  living  !  Publicly  renounced  by  mine  husband,  who 
is  insensible  to  my  virtue,  there  is  only  one  redress  for  me,  to 
undergo  the  ordeal  by  fire !  " 

Hearing  Vaidehi's  words,  Lakshmana,  the  slayer  of  hostile 
warriors,  a  prey  to  indignation,  consulted  Raghava  with  his 
glance  and  by  Rama's  gestures  he  understood  what  was  in  his 
heart,  whereupon  the  valiant  Saumitri,  following  his  indications, 
prepared  the  pyre. 

None  amongst  his  friends  dared  to  appeal  to  Rama,  who 
resembled  Death  himself,  the  Destroyer  of  Time ;  none  dared 
to  speak  or  even  to  look  upon  him. 

Thereafter  Vaidehi,  having  circumambulated  Rama,  who 
stood  with  his  head  bowed,  approached  the  blazing  fire  and, 
paying  obeisance  to  the  Celestials  and  brahmins,  Maithili,  with 
joined  palms,  standing  before  the  flames,  spoke  thus  : — 
337 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"As  my  heart  has  never  ceased  to  be  true  to  Raghava,  do  thou, 
O  Witness  of  all  Beings,  grant  me  thy  protection  !  As  I  am  pure 
in  conduct,  though  Rama  looks  on  me  as  sullied,  do  thou,  O 
Witness  of  the  Worlds,  grant  me  full  protection !  " 

With  these  words,  Vaidehi  circumambulated  the  pyre  and 
with  a  fearless  heart  entered  the  flames. 

And  a  great  multitude  were  assembled  there,  amongst  which 
were  many  children  and  aged  people  who  witnessed  Maithili 
entering  the  fixe.  And,  resembling  gold  that  has  been  melted  in 
the  crucible,  she  threw  herself  into  the  blazing  flames  in  the 
presence  of  all.  That  large-eyed  lady,  entering  the  fire,  who  is 
the  Bearer  of  Sacrificial  Offerings,  appeared  to  those  who  watched 
her  to  resemble  a  golden  altar.  That  fortunate  princess 
entering  the  fire,  which  is  nourished  by  oblations,  seemed,  in  the 
eyes  of  the  Rishis,  Devas  and  Gandharvas,  to  resemble  a 
sacrificial  offering. 

Then  all  the  women  cried  out : — 'Alas  ! '  on  seeing  her,  like 
a  stream  of  butter  hallowed  by  the  recitation  of  mantras,  fall 
into  the  flames,  and  she  appeared  to  the  Three  Worlds,  the  Gods, 
the  Gandharvas  and  the  Danavas  like  a  goddess  smitten  by  a 
curse  and  cast  down  from  heaven  into  hell.  Then,  as  she 
entered  the  flames,  a  great  and  terrible  cry  rose  from  the  titans 
and  the  monkeys.

Brahma's  Praise  of  Rama 

Meanwhile  the  righteous  Rama,  hearing  the  lamentation  of  the 
masses,  afflicted,  pondered  awhile  and  his  eyes  filled  with  tears. 
Then  the  King  Vaishravana  and  Yama  with  the  Pitris,  the 
Thousand-eyed  Lord  of  the  Celestials,  Varuna,  Lord  of  the 
Waters  and  Mahadeva  the  blessed  Three-eyed  God  who  rides 
the  Bull,  as  also  Brahma  the  Creator  of  the  World,  King  of  the 
Learned,  all  gathered  together,  having  hastened  there  in  their 
chariots  as  bright  as  the  sun,  coming  to  the  City  of  Lanka  to  seek 
out  Rama.

YUDDHA    KANDA 

Lifting  up  their  great  arms  and  hands  adorned  with  jewels, 
they  made  obeisance  with  joined  palms  and  the  King  of  the  Gods 
addressing  Raghava,  said : — 

"  O  Creator  of  the  Universe  and  foremost  of  those  versed  in 
the  spiritual  science,  how  canst  thou  manifest  indifference  to 
Sita  falling  into  the  flames  ?  How  art  thou  unaware  that  thou 
thyself  art  the  Chief  of  the  Gods  ?  Formerly  thou  wert  the 
Vasu  Ritadhaman,  the  Progenitor  of  the  Vasus  !  Thou  art  the 
Creator  of  the  Three  Worlds,  Swyamprabhu,  the  eighth  Rudra 
and  the  fifth  of  the  Sadhyas.  The  Twin  Ashwins  are  thy  two 
ears,  the  sun  and  moon  thine  eyes ;  these  are  the  forms  at  the 
beginning,  middle  and  end  of  creation  in  which  thou  dost 
appear,  O  Scourge  of  Thy  Foes ;  and  yet  thou  dost  distrust 
Vaidehi  as  if  thou  wert  an  ordinary  man ! " 

Thus  addressed  by  the  Protector  of  the  Worlds,  the  Leader  of 
the  Gods,  Raghava,  Lord  of  Peoples,  Foremost  of  the  Pious, 
answered : — 

"  I  deem  myself  to  be  a  man,  Rama,  born  of  Dasaratha ; 
who  then  am  I  in  reality  ?  From  whence  have  I  come  ?  Let 
the  Grandsire  of  the  World  inform  me !  " 

Thus  spoke  Kakutstha  and  Brahma,  foremost  of  those  who 
know  the  truth,  addressed  him  saying  : — 

"  Thou  art  the  great  and  effulgent  God  Narayana,  the 
fortunate  Lord  armed  with  the  discus.  Thou  art  the  One- 
Tusked  Boar,  the  Conqueror  of  thy  Foes  in  the  past  and  the 
future.  Thou  art  the  imperishable  Brahman,  Existence  Itself, 
transcending  the  three  divisions  of  time ;  Thou  art  the  Law  of 
Righteousness,  the  Four-armed,  the  Bearer  of  the  Sharnga  Bow ; 
Thou  art  the  Subduer  of  the  senses,  the  Supreme  Purusha ; 
Thou  art  invincible,  Thou  art  the  Holder  of  the  Dagger,  Thou 
art  Vishnu,  Thou  art  Krishna  and  of  immeasurable  might ; 
Thou  art  Senani  and  Gramani,  the  Controller  of  passions,  the 
Origin  and  Dissolution ;  Thou  art  Upendra  and  the  Slayer  of 
the  Demon  Madhu,  Thou  art  the  Creator  of  Indra  and  Indra 
Himself;  Thou  art  the  Lotus-navelled  One;  Thou  dost  bring 
combat  to  an  end.  The  great  and  divine  Rishis  acknowledge 
Thee  as  their  refuge  and  protector.  Thou  art  the  Himalayas  of 
a  hundred  peaks,  the  Essence  of  the  Vedas,  the  God  of  a  Hundred 
Tongues,  the  Great  Bull,  Thou  thyself  art  the  Creator  of  the 
339 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

World,  Swyamprabhu  ;  Thou  art  the  Refuge  and  Elder  of  the 
Siddhas  and  Sadhyas ;  Thou  art  the  Sacrifice,  the  sacred 
syllable  '  Vashat '  and  'Aum  ',  the  greatest  of  the  great.  None 
knows  thine  origin  or  end  or  who  Thou  really  art.  Thou  art 
manifest  in  all  beings,  in  the  cows  and  the  brahmins ;  Thou 
pervadest  all  regions,  the  firmament,  the  mountains  and  the 
rivers,  Thou,  the  Thousand-footed  God,  the  Thousand-headed 
One,  Thou  of  a  Thousand  Eyes  !  Thou  art  the  support  of  all 
beings  and  the  earth.  When  the  earth  is  withdrawn,  under  the 
form  of  a  great  serpent,  Thou  dost  appear  on  the  waters  support- 
ing all  the  worlds  and  the  Gods,  Gandharvas  and  Danavas,  O 
Rama.  I  am  thy  heart  and  the  Goddess  Saraswati,  thy  tongue ; 
the  Gods  are  the  hairs  of  Thy  body,  I,  Brahma  created  them 
thus.  When  Thou  dost  close  thine  eyes,  it  is  night  and  when 
Thou  dost  open  them,  it  is  day.  The  Vedas  are  Thy  Samskaras1; 
nothing  exists  apart  from  thee ;  the  whole  universe  is  Thy 
body,  the  earth  Thy  forbearance ;  Agni  Thy  wrath,  Soma  Thy 
beneficence,  the  Shrivatsa  Mark,  Thy  holy  symbol. 

"  Thou  didst  cover  the  Three  Worlds  in  three  strides ;  Thou 
didst  bind  the  terrible  Bali  and  establish  Mahendra  as  King. 
Sita  is  Lakshmi  and  Thou,  the  God  Vishnu,  Krishna  and 
Prajapari.  It  was  in  order  to  slay  Ravana  that  Thou  didst  enter 
a  human  body.  This  task  that  we  entrusted  to  Thee  has  been 
accomplished,  O  Thou,  the  foremost  of  those  who  observe  their 
duty.  Ravana  having  fallen,  do  Thou  ascend  to  heaven  joyfully ! 
Thy  might  is  irresistible,  O  Rama,  and  thine  exploits  are  never 
fruitless.  To  behold  Thee  and  offer  adoration  to  Thee  is  never 
unprofitable !  It  is  not  in  vain  that  men  are  devoted  to  Thee  on 
earth.  Those  who  are  ever  faithful  to  Thee,  attain  to  Thee  who 
art  the  primeval  Purusha  and  their  desires  will  be  fulfilled  in  this 
world  and  the  other  worlds.  Those  who  recite  this  eternal, 
ancient  and  traditional  theme,  transmitted  by  the  Rishis,  will 
never  suffer  defeat."

CHAPTER    120 
Sita  ts  restored  to  Rama 


Hearing  those  excellent  words  uttered  by  the  Grandsire, 
Vibhabasu,  who  bore  Vaidehi  in  his  lap,  having  extinguished  the 
pyre,  rose  up,  and  that  Bearer  of  Sacrificial  Offerings,  assuming 
a  corporeal  form,  stood  up  and  took  hold  of  the  daughter  of 
Janaka.  Then  that  youthful  woman,  beautiful  as  the  dawn, 
wearing  ornaments  of  refined  gold,  attired  in  a  red  robe,  having 
dark  and  curly  hair,  wearing  fresh  garlands,  the  irreproachable 
Vaidehi  was  restored  to  Rama  by  the  God  of  Fire. 

Thereafter  the  Witness  of  the  whole  world,  Pavaka,  addressed 
Rama,  saying : — 

"  Here  is  Vaidehi,  O  Rama,  there  is  no  sin  in  her  !  Neither  by 
word,  feeling  or  glance  has  thy  lovely  consort  shown  herself  to  be 
unworthy  of  thy  noble  qualities.  Separated  from  thee,  that 
unfortunate  one  was  borne  away  against  her  will  in  the  lonely 
forest  by  Ravana,  who  had  grown  proud  on  account  of  his  power. 
Though  imprisoned  and  closely  guarded  by  titan  women  in  the 
inner  apartments,  thou  wast  ever  the  focus  of  her  thoughts  and 
her  supreme  hope.  Surrounded  by  hideous  and  sinister  women, 
though  tempted  and  threatened,  Maithili  never  gave  place  in  her 
heart  to  a  single  thought  for  that  titan  and  was  solely  absorbed  in 
thee.  She  is  pure  and  without  taint,  do  thou  receive  Maithili ; 
it  is  my  command  that  she  should  not  suffer  reproach  in  any 
way." 

These  words  filled  Rama's  heart  with  delight  and  he,  the  most 
eloquent  of  men,  that  loyal  soul,  reflected  an  instant  within 
himself,  his  glance  full  of  joy.  Then  the  illustrious,  steadfast 
and  exceedingly  valiant  Rama,  the  first  of  virtuous  men,  hearing 
those  words  addressed  to  him,  said  to  the  Chief  of  the  Gods : — 

"  On  account  of  the  people,  it  was  imperative  that  Sita  should 
pass  through  this  trial  by  fire ;  this  lovely  woman  had  dwelt  in 
Ravana's  inner  apartments  for  a  long  time.  Had  I  not  put  the 
innocence  of  Janaki  to  the  test,  the  people  would  have  said : — 
*  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha  is  governed  by  lust  1 '   It  was  well 

z  34* 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

known  to  me  that  Sita  had  never  given  her  heart  to  another  and 
that  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  Maithili,  was  ever  devoted  to  me. 
Ravana  was  no  more  able  to  influence  that  large-eyed  lady,  whose 
chastity  was  her  own  protection  than  the  ocean  may  pass  beyond 
its  bournes.  Despite  his  great  perversity,  he  was  unable  to 
approach  Maithili  even  in  thought,  who  was  inaccessible  to  him 
as  a  name.  That  virtuous  woman  could  never  belong  to  any 
other  than  myself  for  she  is  to  me  what  the  light  is  to  the  sun. 
Her  purity  is  manifest  in  the  Three  Worlds ;  I  could  no  more 
renounce  Maithili,  born  of  Janaka  than  a  hero  his  honour.  It 
behoveth  me  to  follow  your  wise  and  friendly  counsel,  O 
Gracious  Lords  of  the  World." 

Having  spoken  thus,  the  victorious  and  extremely  powerful 
Rama,  full  of  glory,  adored  for  his  noble  exploits,  was  re-united 
with  his  beloved  and  experienced  the  felicity  he  had  merited. 


CHAPTER     121 

Dasaratha  appears  to  Rama 

Hearing  those  excellent  words  uttered  by  Raghava,  Maheshvara 
addressed  him  with  even  greater  eloquence,  saying : — 

"  O  Lotus-eyed  One,  O  Thou  the  possessor  of  long  arms  and 
a  broad  chest,  O  Scourge  of  Thy  foes,  fortunate  it  is  that  thou 
hast  accomplished  this  great  feat,  O  Most  Pious  of  Men  ! 

"  O  Rama,  it  is  well  for  all  beings  that  thou  hast  dispelled  this 
deep  and  dreadful  darkness  of  the  whole  world,  this  fear  created 
by  Ravana.  Go  now  and  console  the  unfortunate  Bharata  with 
thy  presence,  the  illustrious  Kaushalya,  Kaikeyi  and  Sumitra, 
the  mother  of  Lakshmana,  Rule  over  Ayodhya,  giving  satisfac- 
tion to  thine  innumerable  friends  and  establish  the  dynasty  of 
the  Ikshvaku  Race.  O  Mighty  Hero,  having  performed  the 
Ashvamedha  Sacrifice  and  acquired  supreme  renown,  having 
distributed  wealth  among  the  brahmins,  do  thou  attain  the 
highest  state. 

"  Behold  King  Dasaratha  standing  in  his  chariot,  thy  sire,  thy 
superior  in  the  world  of  men,  O  Kakutstha  !  Having  crossed  the 
342 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

sea  of  relativity  by  thy  grace,  fill!  of  glory  he  has  entered  the 
region  of  Indra ;  with  thy  brother  Lakshmana  pay  homage  to 
him! " 

Hearing  the  words  of  Mahadeva,  Raghava  who  was  accom- 
panied by  Lakshmana,  bowed  before  his  sire,  who  was  standing 
in  his  aerial  car  on  high,  and  that  prince  with  his  brother 
Lakshmana  beheld  his  sire  blazing  in  his  own  effulgence,  clad 
in  spotless  raiment.  With  extreme  delight,  King  Dasaratha, 
standing  in  his  chariot,  once  again  beheld  his  son  who  was  as 
dear  to  him  as  his  own  life  and  that  long-armed  warrior,  on  his 
seat,  took  him  in  his  lap  and  embracing  him,  said : — 

"  Far  from  thee  I  do  not  prize  the  heaven  in  which  I  dwell 
with  the  Gods,  O  Rama,  this  is  the  truth !  O  Most  Eloquent  of 
Men,  the  words  addressed  to  me  by  Kaikeyi,  which  were  designed 
to  effect  thy  banishment,  have  never  been  erased  from  mine 
heart !  Embracing  thee  and  Lakshmana  and  beholding  thee 
well  and  happy,  I  am  delivered  from  mine  affliction  as  the  sun 
when  the  mist  has  been  dispelled.  By  thy  grace,  O  My  Son,  thou 
who  art  truly  filial  and  of  noble  soul,  I  am  redeemed,  as  was  the 
virtuous  Brahmin  Kahola  by  Ashtavakra.  Now  it  is  made  clear 
to  me,  O  Dear  Child,  that  in  order  to  destroy  Ravana,  the  Gods 
determined  that  the  supreme  Purusha  should  become  incarnate 
as  man. 

"Assuredly  Kaushalya  will  see  all  her  desires  fulfilled,  O 
Rama,  when  she  beholds  thee  returning  from  the  forest,  O 
Slayer  of  Thy  Foes.  O  Rama,  the  people,  seeing  thee  returning 
to  the  city  and  installed  as  king  and  ruler  of  the  world,  will 
indeed  be  blessed !  I  desire  to  see  thee  re-united  with  Bharata, 
thy  devoted,  valiant,  pure  and  loyal  brother.  Thou  hast  passed 
fourteen  years  in  the  forest  with  my  beloved  Sita  and  Lakshmana, 
O  Dear  Child.  The  term  of  thine  exile  is  over,  thy  vows  honoured, 
and  further,  by  slaying  Ravana  on  the  battlefield,  thou  hast 
gratified  the  Gods.  Thy  task  is  accomplished ;  thou  hast  won 
infinite  renown,  O  Slayer  of  Thy  Foes ;  now,  installed  as  king, 
mayest  thou  with  thy  brothers  live  for  a  long  time !  " 

With  joined  palms,  paying  obeisance  to  King  Dasaratha,  who 
had  thus  addressed  him,  Rama  answered : — 

"  O  Virtuous  Sire,  give  thy  blessings  to  Kaikeyi  and  Bharata  ! 
Thou  didst  pronounce  a  terrible  curse  upon  them,  saying : — '  I 
343 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

renounce  thee  and  thy  son !  *,  may  this  malediction  not  fall  on 
Kaikeyi  or  her  son,  O  Lord."  '  Be  it  so  ! '  replied  that  great 
monarch,  paying  obeisance  with  joined  palms  to  Rama  who  had 
spoken  thus,  and  thereafter  embracing  Lakshmana,  he  said  to 
him : — 

"  Thou  hast  acquired  extreme  merit,  O  Pious  One,  and  thy 
fame  will  be  great  on  earth ;  by  Rama's  grace  thou  shalt  attain 
heaven  and  thy  power  shall  be  inconceivable.  Attend  on  Rama 
and  be  happy,  O  Thou  who  art  the  increaser  of  Sumitra's 
delight.  Rama  is  ever  engaged  in  the  welfare  of  all  beings.  The 
Three  Worlds  with  their  Indras,  the  Siddhas  and  the  great 
Rishis  do  honour  to  that  great  hero  and  adore  him  as  the 
supreme  Purusha.  He,  thy  brother,  is  the  invincible,  imperish- 
able Brahman,  the  essence  of  the  Veda,  which  is  secret,  and  the 
Inner  Ruler  of  all,  O  Dear  Child  1  Thou  hast  acquired  great 
merit  and  glory  in  serving  him  and  the  Princess  of  Videha  with 
devotion ! " 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Lakshmana,  the  King  paid  obeisance 
to  Sita  who  stood  before  him  with  joined  palms,  and  addressed 
her  in  gentle  tones,  saying  : — 

"  My  Daughter,  do  not  take  it  ill  that  Rama  renounced  thee  ! 
O  Vaidehi,  he  acted  thus  in  thine  own  interest  in  order  to 
demonstrate  thine  innocence  !  The  proof  of  thy  chaste  conduct, 
which  thou  hast  given  to-day,  places  thee  above  all  other  women. 
O  My  Daughter,  thou  hast  no  need  to  be  instructed  regarding 
thy  duty  towards  thy  husband,  nevertheless  I  must  tell  thee  that 
he  is  the  Supreme  God." 

Having  thus  addressed  his  two  sons  and  Sita,  King  Dasaratha, 
the  descendant  of  Raghu,  ascended  to  the  region  of  Indra  in  his 
chariot.  Mounted  on  his  aerial  car,  full  of  majesty,  his  body 
blazing  with  effulgence,  that  foremost  of  men,  having  given  his 
counsel  to  his  two  sons  and  Sita,  returned  to  the  abode  of  the 
Sovereign  of  the  Gods.

CHAPTER     122 

On  Rama's  request  Indra  restores  the  Army 

King  Dasaratha  having  departed,  Mahendra,  the  Vanquisher  of 
Paka,  addressed  Raghava,  who  stood  before  him  with  joined 
palms,  and  said : — 

"  O  Rama,  O  Lion  among  Men,  our  presence  here  must  not 
prove  unfruitful ;  we  are  pleased  with  thee ;  ask  what  thou 
desirest ! " 

Hearing  these  magnanimous  words  of  the  blessed  Mahendra, 
Raghava,  of  compassionate  soul,  answered  him  joyfully  : — 

"  Since  thou  wishest  to  gratify  me,  O  Chief  of  the  Vibudhas, 
grant  me  that  which  I  ask  of  thee  !  O  Most  Eloquent  of  Orators, 
let  all  the  valiant  monkeys,  who  for  my  sake  descended  into  the 
region  of  death,  be  resuscitated  and  live  again.  I  wish  to  see  all 
those  monkeys  happy,  who  for  my  sake  left  their  sons  and  wives, 

0  Great  Lord. 

"  Those  courageous  monkeys,  those  heroes  who  courted 
death  and,  crowning  their  sacrifice,  succumbed,  do  thou  restore 
to  life,  O  Purandara  \  Devoted  to  mine  interests  they  disregarded 
death ;  be  gracious  enough  to  give  them  back  to  their  families ; 

1  solicit  this  favour  of  thee !  I  wish  to  see  the  Golangulas  and  the 
Bears  in  all  their  former  energy,  freed  from  their  sufferings  and 
their  wounds,  O  Munificent  God.  Let  there  be  flowers,  roots 
and  fruits,  even  though  they  be  out  of  season,  and  rivers  with 
pure  water  in  abundance  wherever  the  monkeys  are  to  be  found." 

Hearing  these  words  of  the  magnanimous  Raghava,  Mahendra 
answered  graciously : — 

"  Hard  indeed  to  fulfil  is  this  boon,  thou  dost  crave,  O  Dear 
Prince  of  the  Raghus,  but  my  words  never  prove  vain ;  so  be  it ! 
May  all  those  who  have  been  slain  in  battle  by  the  titans,  the 
Bears  and  the  Gopucchas,  whose  heads  and  arms  have  been 
severed,  be  resurrected  !  May  those  monkeys  rise  up  exalting, 
without  pain  or  wounds,  in  all  their  natural  vigour  and  courage, 
like  sleepers  who  wake  at  the  end  of  night,  and  let  them  be  re- 
united with  their  friends,  relatives  and  tribes !  O  Thou,  the 
345 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Wielder  of  die  Great  Bow,  may  the  trees  be  laden  with  fruit  and 
flowers  even  out  of  season  and  the  rivers  be  full  of  pure  water." 

Thereupon  those  excellent  monkeys,  who  were  formerly 
covered  with  wounds,  rose  up  healed,  as  persons  who  have  been 
asleep,  and  there  was  general  astonishment  amongst  the  monkeys, 
who  questioned  each  other,  saying, '  What  is  this  ? ' 

Seeing  bis  purpose  fulfilled,  the  Gods,  in  an  excess  of  joy, 
unanimously  addressed  Rama,  who  was  accompanied  by  Laksh- 
mana,  praising  him  and  saying  : — 

"  Now  return  to  Ayodnya,  O  King  and  disband  the  monkeys ; 
do  thou  console  the  devoted  and  illustrious  Maithili !  Seek  out 
thy  brother  Bharata  who,  in  sorrow  of  thy  separation,  has  given 
himself  up  to  penances.  Approach  the  magnanimous  Shatrughna 
and  all  thy  mothers,  O  Scourge  of  Thy  Foes  !  Be  installed  as 
king  and  rejoice  the  hearts  of  the  citizens  by  thy  return  !  " 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Rama  who  was  accompanied  by 
Saumitri,  the  Gods,  paying  obeisance  to  him,  joyfully  returned 
to  heaven  in  their  chariots  blazing  like  the  sun ;  and  Rama 
with  his  brother  ordered  the  encampment  of  the  army. 

Thereafter,  under  Rama  and  Lakshmana's  protection,  that 
great  and  glorious  company  of  happy  people,  radiant  with 
splendour,  resembled  the  night  illumined  on  all  sides  by  that  orb 
of  cool  rays. 


CHAPTER     123 

Bibishana  places  the  Chariot  Pushpaka  at  Rama's  disposal 

Having  passed  the  night,  Rama  the  conqueror  of  bis  foes,  rose 
happily  and  Bibishana,  paying  obeisance  to  him  with  joined 
palms,  addressed  him,  saying  : — 

"  Here  are  various  articles  for  bathing  such  as  unguents, 
ornaments,  sandalwood  paste,  raiment  and  celestial  garlands  of 
every  kind.    Lotus-eyed  women,  versed  in  the  art  of  applying 
perfume  await  thy  pleasure,  as  is  fitting,  0  Raghava  1 " 
At  these  words,  Kakutstha  answered  Bibishana  saying  : — 
"  Do  thou  invite  the  foremost  of  the  monkeys  and  Sugriva  to 
bathe  first,  for  the  pious  Bharata,  accustomed  to  happiness,  that 
346 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

youthful  and  loyal  hero  is  suffering  on  mine  account.  Far  from 
Bharata,  Kaikeyi's  son,  who  has  been  loyal  to  his  duty,  I  do  not 
value  bathing  or  raiment  or  jewels !  Order  it  so  that  we  may 
return  to  Ayodhya  soon,  assuredly  the  route  is  extremely 
arduous.'* 
Thus  did  Rama  speak  and  Bibishana  answered  : — 
"  I  will  arrange  for  thee  to  reach  that  city  in  one  day,  O 
Prince !  May  happiness  attend  thee !  There  is  an  aerial  car 
named  Pushpaka  that  shines  like  the  sun,  which  the  powerful 
Ravana  forcibly  took  from  Kuvera,  having  overcome  him  in 
combat.  That  celestial  and  marvellous  chariot,  going  everywhere 
at  will,  is  at  thy  disposal,  O  Thou  of  unequalled  prowess !  That 
car,  bright  as  a  cloud,  which  will  transport  thee  to  Ayodhya  in 
perfect  safety,  is  here.  But  if  I  am  worthy  of  a  boon,  if  thou 
dost  recall  any  merit  in  me,  then  remain  here  for  at  least  one  day, 

0  Virtuous  One.  If  thou  hast  any  friendship  for  me,  then  remain 
here  with  thy  brother  Lakshmana  and  Vaidehi,  thy  consort. 
Having  received  all  possible  homage,  O  Rama,  thou  shalt 
depart.  I  nave  prepared  those  honours  dictated  by  mine 
affection,  O  Rama,  do  thou  enjoy  them  with  thine  innumerable 
friends  and  thine  army  also.  I  beg  thee  in  all  humility,  out  of  my 
profound  esteem  and  feeling  of  friendship  for  thee,  O  Raghava  ; 

1  am  thy  servant  and  therefore  may  not  command  thee." 
Then  Rama  answered  Bibishana,  who  had  spoken  thus  in  the 

presence  of  all  the  titans  and  monkeys  and  said : — 

"  O  Hero,  Thou  hast  honoured  me  with  thy  friendship  with 
thine  whole  soul  and  in  all  thine  actions  hast  proved  thy  supreme 
affection  for  me.  Nevertheless  I  cannot  accept  thy  request,  O 
King  of  the  Titans,  because  my  heart  urges  me  to  see  my  brother 
Bharata  again,  he  who  came  to  Chittrakuta  in  order  to  bring  me 
back  to  Ayodhya  though,  as  he  bowed  before  me,  I  did  not  listen 
to  his  appeal.  I  wish  to  see  Kaushalya,  Sumitra  and  the  illus- 
trious Kaikeyi,  as  also  mine  house,  my  friends,  the  people  of  the 
city  and  the  country.  Grant  me  leave,  O  Dear  Bibishana,  Thou 
hast  paid  me  sufficient  honour  !  Do  not  be  angry,  O  My  Friend, 
I  beg  of  thee.  O  Foremost  of  the  Titans,  prepare  the  aerial  car 
speedily,  my  task  has  been  accomplished,  what  justification  is 
there  for  reniaining  here  longer  ?  " 
Hearing  Rama's  words,  that  Indra  among  the  Titans,  Bibi- 
347 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

shana,  hastened  to  order  the  aerial  Chariot  Pushpaka,  gilded  and 
bright  as  the  sun,  with  its  seats  of  emerald  and  pearl,  its  rooms 
ranged  round  about,  silvered  all  over,  its  white  banners  and 
supports  and  gilded  apartments  enriched  with  golden  lotuses 
which  were  hung  with  many  bells.  Round  the  windows,  set 
with  pearls  and  rare  gems,  rows  of  bells  were  placed  giving  forth 
a  melodious  sound,  and  that  moving  palace,  resembling  the  peak 
of  Mount  Meru,  constructed  by  Vishvakarma,  abounded  in  rich 
ornaments,  gold  and  jewels  and  sparkled  with  silver]  and  its  floors 
were  inlaid  with  crystal  and  the  thrones  of  emerald  (displayed 
there)  furnished  with  rare  coverings. 

Having  prepared  that  indestructible  vehicle,  the  Chariot 
Pushpaka,  which  was  as  swift  as  thought,  Bibishana  stood  before 
Rama,  and  that  aerial  car,  that  went  everywhere  at  one's  will 
and  resembled  a  mountain,  having  been  placed  at  his  disposal, 
the  magnanimous  Rama  who  was  accompanied  by  Saumitri,  was 
astonished. 


CHAPTER     124 

Rama  sets  out  for  Ayodhya 

The  Chariot  Pushpaka,  having  been  prepared  and  adorned  with 
flowers,  Bibishana,  who  stood  a  litde  way  off  with  joined  palms, 
reverendy  enquired  of  Rama  with  some  urgency,  saying  : — 

"  What  shall  I  do  now,  O  Raghava  ?  " 

Then  the  supremely  illustrious  Raghava,  having  reflected 
awhile,  in  the  presence  of  Lakshmana,  made  answer  affectionately, 
saying: — 

"All  the  inhabitants  of  the  woods  have  brought  about  the 
fulfilment  of  my  mission  by  their  efforts ;  O  Bibishana,  do  thou 
gratify  them  abundandy  with  jewels  and  riches  of  every  kind. 
With  their  support  thou  hast  recaptured  Lanka,  O  Sovereign  of 
the  Titans  !  Full  of  ardour,  they  did  not  fear  to  expose  then- 
lives  nor  did  they  ever  retreat  in  combat.  They  have  fulfilled 
their  task ;  now  reward  them  by  distributing  gold  and  gems 
among  them.  When,  in  thy  gratitude,  thou  hast  loaded  them 
with  gifts,  the  monkeys  will  be  fully  satisfied. 
348 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

"  Thou  dost  know  how  to  give  and  how  to  receive,  thou  art 
liberal  and  master  of  thy  senses,  all  know  thee  to  be  a  renunciate, 
it  is  for  this  that  I  address  thee  and  exhort  thee,  O  Prince ;  a 
king  will  wage  war  in  vain  and  his  army  abandon  him  at  the  first 
opportunity  if  he  be  wholly  devoid  of  those  qualities  that  render 
him  pleasing  to  all." 

Hearing  Rama's  words,  Bibishana  bestowed  precious  gems  and 
riches  of  every  kind  in  abundance  on  all  the  monkeys  and, 
beholding  the  foremost  of  the  monkeys  loaded  with  jewels  and 
silver,  Rama  ascended  the  chariot  of  his  adversary,  holding  the 
chaste  and  illustrious  Vaidehi  to  his  breast  and  accompanied  by 
his  brother  Lakshmana,  that  valiant  bow-man. 

Standing  in  the  chariot,  Kakutstha  bade  farewell  to  all  the 
monkeys,  to  the  mighty  Sugriva  and  to  Bibishana  and  said  : — 

"  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  you  have  accomplished  all  that 
could  be  asked  of  a  friend,  now  go  where  you  will,  I  give  you  all 
leave  to  depart.  O  Sugriva,  thou  who  fearest  nought  but 
unrighteousness,  thou  hast  done  all  that  a  devoted  and  loyal 
companion  could  do ;  return  to  Kishkinda  at  the  head  of  thine 
army.  And  thou,  Bibishana,  occupy  the  throne  of  Lanka  that 
I  have  conferred  upon  thee.  Even  the  inhabitants  of  heaven  and 
their  chiefs  will  not  be  able  to  trouble  thee.  I  go  to  Ayodhya, 
that  was  the  royal  residence  of  my  sire  and  wish  to  take  leave  of 
you  all  and  to  offer  you  my  salutations  1 " 

Thus  did  Rama  speak  and  all  the  leaders  of  the  monkeys  and 
the  monkeys  themselves  as  also  the  Titan  Bibishana,  paying 
obeisance  with  joined  palms,  answered : — 

'*  We  desire  to  go  to  Ayodhya,  take  us  all  with  thee !  We  shall 
delight  in  ranging  the  woods  and  copses  and  assisting  at  thine 
installation,  of  which  thou  art  worthy.  Having  paid  obeisance  to 
the  Queen  Kaushalya,  we  shall  return  to  our  homes  without 
delay,  0  Greatest  of  Kings  !  " 

Thus  did  they  speak  and  the  virtuous  Rama  answered  the 
monkeys,  Sugriva  and  Bibishana,  saying  : — 

"  Nothing  would  be  more  agreeable  to  me,  as  also  to  mine 
innumerable  friends,  than  to  return  to  the  capital  with  you  all. 
Hasten  to  take  thy  place  with  thy  monkeys  in  the  chariot,  O 
Sugriva,  and  thou  too,  O  Bibishana  with  thy  ministers,  O  King 
of  the  Titans." 

349

Thereupon  Sugriva  with  the  monkeys  and  Bibishana  with  his 
counsellors,  took  their  places  in  the  celestial  Pushpaka  Chariot 
and,  all  being  installed,  that  marvellous  aerial  car  belonging  to 
Kuvera  rose  into  the  air  under  Raghava's  command.  In  the 
chariot,  which  shone  brightly,  and  was  harnessed  to  swans,  Rama 
exulted,  overcome  with  delight,  and  resembled  Kuvera  himself, 
whilst  all  the  monkeys,  bears  and  titans,  full  of  vigour,  seated 
comfortably  in  that  celestial  car  travelled  at  ease. 


chapter   125 

Rama  tells  Sita  of  the  Places  over  which  they  are  passing 

Under  Rama's  command,  that  aerial  chariot  harnessed  to  swans 
flew  through  the  air  with  a  great  noise,  and  Rama,  the  delight  of 
the  Raghus,  letting  fall  his  glance  on  every  side,  said  to 
the  Princess  of  Mithila,  Sita,  whose  face  resembled  the 
moon : — 

"  See  how  Lanka  has  been  constructed  by  Vishvakarma  on  the 
summit  of  the  Trikuta  Mountain,  which  resembles  the  peak  of 
Mount  Kailasha.  Behold  the  battlefield  covered  with  a  mire  of 
flesh  and  blood ;  there,  O  Sita,  a  great  carnage  of  monkeys  and 
titans  took  place.  There  lies  the  ferocious  King  of  the  Titans, 
Ravana,  who,  despite  the  boons  he  had  received,  was  slain  by  me 
on  thine  account,  O  Large-eyed  Lady. 

"  Here  Kumbhakarna  was  struck  down  as  also  another  ranger 
of  the  night ;  Prahasta  and  Dhumraksha  perished  here  under  the 
blows  of  the  monkey,  Hanuman.  Vidyunmalin  was  put  to  death 
at  this  spot  by  the  great-souled  Sushena,  and  in  another,  Laksh- 
mana  overcame  Indrajita,  the  son  of  Ravana.  Angada  struck 
down  the  Titans  named  Vikata  and  Virupaksha,  hideous  to  look 
upon,  as  also  Mahaparshwa  and  Mahodara.  Akampana  suc- 
cumbed, as  also  other  valiant  warriors,  Trishiras,  Atikaya, 
Devantaka  and  Narantaka,  Yuddhonmatta  and  Matta,  both 
great  heroes,  Nikumbha  and  Kumbha,  the  two  sons  of  Kumbha- 
karna, who  were  full  of  courage ;  Vajradamshtra,  Damshtra  and 
350 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

innumerable  other  titans  perished  here  and  the  invincible 
Maharaksha  whom  I  slew  in  combat ;  and  Akampana1  was  slain 
and  the  powerful  Shonitaksha  whilst  Yupaksha  and  Prajangha 
also  succumbed  in  the  great  struggle.  Vidyujjihva,  a  titan  of 
fearful  aspect  fell  there  and  Yajnashatru  died  also  ;  the  mighty 
Suptaghna  too,  as  also  Suryashatru,  were  slain  with  Brahma- 
shatru,  who  had  no  equal,  and  here  Mandodari's  consort,  for  whom 
she  wept  surrounded  by  her  companions  to  the  number  of  a 
thousand  or  more. 

"  Here  is  the  place  where  the  ocean  was  traversed,  O  Lady  of 
Lovely  Looks,  and,  having  passed  over  the  sea,  there  is  the  spot 
where  the  night  was  spent.  There  the  bridge  that  I  had  thrown 
over  the  ocean  of  salty  waves  on  thine  account,  O  Large-eyed 
Lady,  that  causeway,  difficult  of  construction,  was  built  by  Nala. 
Behold  the  ocean,  O  Vaidehi,  that  indestructible  abode  of  Varuna's 
that  seems  without  bourne,  whose  thundering  waters  abound  in 
conch  shells  and  pearls.  O  Maithili,  behold  that  golden  moun- 
tain, which,  cleaving  the  waves,  rose  out  of  the  bosom  of  the  deep 
in  order  to  allow  Hanuman  to  rest.  And  here,  our  headquarters 
were  established ;  here,  formerly  the  Lord  Mahadeva  granted 
me  a  boon  and  there  is  the  sacred  and  purifying  spot  known  as 
Setubandha2  where  even  the  greatest  sins  are  washed  away. 
Here  Bibishana,  King  of  the  Titans,  first  came  to  me.  Now  we 
have  reached  Kishkindha  with  its  beautiful  woods,  it  is  Sugriva's 
capital  where  I  slew  Bali." 

Then  Sita,  seeing  the  Gty  of  Kishkindha  of  which  Bah'  was 
formerly  the  support,  said  to  Rama  in  gende,  loving  and  wistful 
tones: — 

"  I  desire  to  enter  thy  royal  capital,  Ayodhya,  O  Prince,  with 
the  beloved  consorts  of  Sugriva,  Tara  at  their  head,  as  also  the 
wives  of  the  other  leaders  of  the  monkeys !  " 

Thus  spoke  Vaidehi  and  Raghava  answered,  '  So  be  it ! ', 
thereafter  reaching  the  heights  of  Kishkindha,  he  caused  the 
aerial  chariot  to  halt  and  said  to  Sugriva : — 

"  O  Lion  among  Monkeys,  command  all  the  Plavamgamas, 
accompanied  by  their  wives,  to  come  to  Ayodhya  with  Sita  and 

1  Akampana  appears  twice  ;   it  is  not  known  if  it  refers  to  the  same  warrior 

or  another. 
*  This  place  is  still  to  be  seen  near  Rameshwara — a  place  of  pilgrimage.

myself.    Let  all  come,  O  King,  and  make  haste  to  depart,  O 
Sugriva ! " 

Hearing  Rama's  command,  he  whose  energy  was  immeasur- 
able, Sugriva,  the  illustrious  monarch  of  the  monkeys,  attended 
by  his  ministers  entered  the  inner  apartments  and,  seeing  Tara, 
said  to  her : — 

"  O  Dear  One,  at  the  command  of  Raghava,  who  wishes  to 
gratify  Vaidehi,  do  thou  speedily  assemble  the  consorts  of  the 
magnanimous  monkeys  so  that  they  may  leave  for  Ayodhya  to 
visit  the  wives  of  King  Dasaratha." 

Hearing  Sugriva's  words,  Tara,  of  beautiful  limbs,  gathered 
all  the  female  monkeys  together  and  said  to  them : — 

"  Sugriva  commands  us  to  leave  for  Ayodhya ;  do  me  the 
favour  of  accompanying  me  and  witness  the  entry  of  Rama  in 
the  midst  of  the  people  from  town  and  country  and  the  splendour 
of  the  wives  of  Dasaratha." 

Thus  commanded  by  Tara,  the  female  monkeys,  having  first 
adorned  themselves  and  circumambulated  her,  ascended  the  car, 
anxious  to  behold  Sita,  and  that  aerial  chariot  at  once  rose  into 
the  air  with  them. 

Then  Raghava,  gazing  down  on  all  sides,  having  reached  the 
vicinity  of  Rishyamuka,  once  more  addressed  Vaidehi,  saying : — 
"  O  Sita,  here  is  a  great  mountain  resembling  a  cloud  rent  by 
lightning,  abounding  in  gold  and  other  metals.  It  is  here  that  I 
met  that  Indra  among  Monkeys,  Sugriva,  and  entered  into  an 
agreement  with  him  to  slay  Bali.  Here  is  the  Pampa  Lake  with 
its  marvellous  fields  of  blue  lotuses  and  here  separated  from 
thee,  out  of  the  depth  of  mine  affliction,  I  wept !  It  was  on  its 
banks  that  beheld  the  virtuous  Shabari. 

"  Here  I  slew  Kabandha,  whose  arms  extended  tor  four  miles  ! 
O  Sita,  in  Janasthana,  I  came  upon  that  magnificent  tree,  the 
Ashwatta,  near  which  Jatayu,  the  renowned  and  valiant  Monarch 
of  Birds  perished  under  Ravana's  blows  on  thine  account,  O 
Lovely  One.  And  there  is  our  hermitage,  O  Lady  of  Brilliant 
Complexion,  where  our  enchanting  leafy  hut  may  be  seen.  It  is 
there  that  thou  wert  borne  away  by  force  by  the  King  of  the 
Titans. 

"  There  is  the  ravishing  Godavari  of  transparent  waters  and 
there,  the  retreat  of  Agastya  can  be  seen,  that  is  covered  with 
352 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

palms,  as  also  Sharabhanga's  hermitage  where  the  God  of  a 
Thousand  Eyes,  the  Destroyer  of  Gties,  entered  in  secret.  O 
Goddess  of  slender  waist,  behold  the  ascetics  with  Atri  at  their 
head,  the  equal  of  Surya  and  Vaishnava  ;  in  that  place  the  Giant 
Viradha  fell  under  my  blows  and  there,  O  Sita,  thou  didst  visit 
the  virtuous  Sage.  See,  O  Lady  of  beautiful  form,  the  King  of 
Mountains,  Chittrakuta,  appears ;  it  is  there  that  the  son  of 
Kaikeya  came  to  crave  my  forgiveness.  Here  is  the  enchanting 
Yamuna  with  its  ravishing  woods  and  here  the  retreat  of 
Bharadwaja  looms  into  view,  O  Maithili.  Now  we  are  in  sight  of 
the  Ganges,  that  three-branched  sacred  river.  There  is  the  City 
of  Shringavera  where  my  friend,  Guha,  dwells,  and  there, 
the  River  Sarayu  with  rows  of  stone  pillars  on  its  banks 
commemorating  the  Kings  of  the  House  of  Ikshvaku  !  Behold 
there  the  royal  abode  of  my  Sire !  O  Vaidehi,  bow  down  to 
Ayodhja,  we  have  returned  !  " 

During  this  time  the  monkeys  and  the  titans  were  leaping 
about  in  delight  on  seeing  that  city  and,  with  the  palaces  with 
which  it  abounded,  its  wide  spaces  and  the  elephants  and  horses 
that  filled  it,  Ayodhya  appeared  to  the  monkeys  and  titans  to 
resemble  Amaravati,  the  city  of  the  mighty  Indra. 


CHAPTER     126 

Rama's  Meeting  with  the  Sage  Bharadaaja 

Having  completed  the  fourteen  years  of  exile,  on  the  fifth  day  of 
the  lunar  fortnight,  the  elder  brother  of  Lakshmana  reached  the 
hermitage  of  Bharadwaja  and  bowed  low  before  that  Ascetic. 
Paying  obeisance  to  him,  he  enquired  of  the  Sage,  saying : — 

"  O  Blessed  One,  dost  thou  know  if  all  are  well  and  happy  in 
the  city  ?  Is  Bharata  fixed  in  his  duty  ?  Do  my  mothers  still 
live?" 

Thus  did  Rama  question  Bharadwaja  and  that  great  Sage, 
smiling,  answered  the  Prince  of  the  Raghus  cheerfully  and 
said: — 

"  Bharata,  his  locks  matted,  carrying  out  thine  instructions, 
353 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

awaits  thy  return.  In  the  presence  of  thy  sandals,  to  which  he 
pays  homage,  he  rules  all  in  the  best  interests  of  thy  family  and 
country. 

"  Beholding  thee  clad  in  bark,  setting  out  on  foot,  thy  consort 
making  the  third,1  banished  from  thy  kingdom,  entirely  devoted 
to  thy  duty,  obedient  to  the  behests  of  thy  sire,  renouncing  every 
pleasure,  like  unto  a  God  driven  from  heaven,  formerly  I  was 
filled  with  pity  for  thee;  then,  O  Victorious  Warrior,  thou, 
dispossessed  by  Kaikeyi,  nourished  thyself  on  fruits  and  roots ; 
but  now  I  see  thee,  thy  purpose  accomplished  surrounded  by 
friends  and  kinsfolk,  having  triumphed  over  thine  enemy  and 
my  joy  is  supreme  ! 

"  I  know  all  that  thou  hast  experienced  of  good  and  ill  whilst 
dwelling  in  Janasthana,  O  Raghava,  and  how,  engaged  in 
procuring  the  welfare  of  the  Sages,  seeking  to  protect  them  all, 
thine  irreproachable  consort  was  borne  away  by  Ravana.  I 
know  of  die  appearance  of  Maricha  and  Sita's  delusion ;  the 
meeting  with  Kabandha;  thine  arrival  at  Lake  Fampa,  the 
alliance  with  Sugriva  when  Bali  fell  under  thy  blows ;  the  search 
for  Vaidehi  and  the  exploit  of  the  Wind-god's  son ;  the  construc- 
tion of  the  causeway  by  Nala  and  the  finding  of  Vaidehi ;  how 
Lanka  was  set  on  fire  by  the  foremost  of  the  monkeys  whilst  he 
was  bound  ;  how  Ravana,  proud  of  his  strength,  fell  in  the  fight 
with  his  sons,  kinsfolk,  ministers,  infantry  and  cavalry ;  how 
after  the  death  of  Ravana,  who  was  a  thorn  in  the  side  of  the 
Gods,  thou  didst  meet  the  Celestials  and  receive  a  boon  from 
them ;  all  these  things  I  know  by  virtue  of  my  penances,  O  Hero, 

0  Thou  who  art  fixed  in  virtue. 

"  Therefore  I  have  sent  my  disciples  to  carry  the  news  to  the 
city  and  I  too  will  grant  thee  a  boon,  O  Most  Skilful  of  Warriors ; 
but  first  accept  the  Arghya,  to-morrow  thou  shalt  go  to  Ayodhya," 

Hearing  these  words,  the  illustrious  prince,  with  bowed  head, 
answered  joyfully,  *  It  is  well ! '  and  made  the  following  request  :- 

"  On  the  road  I  take  to  reach  Ayodhya,  though  it  is  not  the 
season,  yet  may  all  the  trees  bear  honeyed  fruits  and  those  fruits 
have  the  fragrance  of  'Amrita  "  and  may  every  variety  be  found 
there;  O  Blessed  One  !  " 

1  Rama  and  Lakshmana  being  the  other  two. 
*  Amrita — Nectar  of  Immortality. 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

Thereupon  the  Sage  replied :  "  So  be  it !  Thy  desire  shall  be 
realised  immediately  !  "  Then  the  trees  of  that  region  instantly 
resembled  those  of  Paradise.  Those  that  had  none,  grew  fruits, 
and  those  that  had  no  flowers  were  covered  with  blossom; 
trees  that  had  withered  were  enveloped  with  foliage  and  all 
dripped  with  honey  for  three  leagues  along  the  way. 

Meanwhile  the  foremost  of  the  monkeys  regaled  themselves  on 
those  celestial  fruits  to  the  extent  of  their  desire  and,  transported 
with  joy,  imagined  they  had  entered  heaven. 


chapter    127 

Rama  sends  Hanuman  to  seek  out  Bharata 

When  he  beheld  Ayodhya,  that  descendant  of  Raghu  of  rapid 
step  full  of  magnanimity,  gave  himself  up  to  pleasant  thoughts 
and,  having  reflected  awhile,  that  fortunate  and  illustrious 
hero  said  to  the  monkey,  Hanuman : — 

"  Hasten  with  all  speed  to  Ayodhya,  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys, 
and  ascertain  if  all  are  happy  in  the  royal  palace.  Passing 
Shringavera,  communicate  with  Guha,  King  of  the  Nishadas, 
who  dwells  in  a  wooded  country,  and  offer  him  my  salutations. 
When  he  hears  that  I  am  safe  and  well,  freed  from  all  anxieties, 
he  will  be  content,  for  he  is  my  second  self  and  my  friend.  He 
will  gladly  show  thee  the  way  to  Ayodhya  and  give  thee  tidings 
of  Bharata.  Do  thou  enquire  of  Bharata  as  to  his  well-being  and 
inform  him  that  I  have  returned  with  my  consort  and  Laksh- 
mana,  my  mission  accomplished.  Tell  him  of  Site's  abduction 
by  the  ruthless  Ravana,  of  my  meeting  with  Sugriva  and  the 
death  of  Bali  in  combat ;  of  how  I  set  out  to  find  Maithili  and 
how  thou  didst  discover  her,  having  crossed  the  great  waters  of 
that  domain  of  the  unchangeable  Lord  of  Rivers  !  Tell  him  of 
our  arrival  on  the  shores  of  the  sea,  the  appearance  of  Sagara  and 
how  the  causeway  was  constructed ;  how  Ravana  perished ;  of 
the  boons  bestowed  on  me  by  Mahendra,  Brahma  and  Varuna 
and,  by  the  favour  of  Mahadeva,  the  meeting  with  my  Sire. 
355 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Inform  Bharata,  O  My  Friend,  that  I  am  coming  accompanied 
by  King  Bibishana  and  the  Lord  of  the  Monkeys.  Say  to  him, 
'  Having  overcome  the  army  of  the  enemy  and  attained  a  glory 
without  parallel,  Rama,  his  purpose  accomplished,  is  approaching 
with  his  valiant  friends  '.  Do  thou  carefully  observe  the  expres- 
sion on  the  face  of  Bharata  when  he  hears  these  tidings  and  how 
he  comports  himself.  Thou  wilt  know  all  by  his  gestures,  the 
colour  of  his  face,  his  glances  and  his  words.  Whose  mind 
would  not  be  moved  by  the  thought  of  (ascending)  an  ancestral 
throne,  fulfilling  all  one's  dreams,  and  to  a  kingdom  abounding 
in  prosperity,  hosts  of  elephants,  horses  and  chariots  ?  If 
the  fortunate  Bharata  wishes  to  reign  in  his  own  right,  then, 
by  mutual  agreement,  let  that  descendant  of  Raghu  govern 
the  entire  earth !  " 

On  receiving  these  instructions}  Hanuman,  born  of  Maruta, 
assuming  human  form,  left  in  all  haste  for  Ayodhya  and 
advanced  with  speed,  like  unto  Garuda  swooping  on  a  great  serpent 
on  which  he  wishes  to  lay  hold.  Traversing  the  path-way  of  his 
sire,  the  shining  abode  of  great  birds  and,  crossing  over  the 
formidable  confluence  of  the  Ganges  and  the  Yamuna,  he  reached 
the  City  of  Shringavera.  Then  the  valiant  Hanuman  sought  out 
Guha  and  said  to  him,  his  voice  ringing  with  joy : — 

"  Thy  friend,  Kakutstha,  that  true  hero  who  is  accompanied 
by  Sita  as  also  Saumitri,  enquires  as  to  thy  welfare.  Having 
spent  the  fifth  night  of  the  moon  with  the  Sage  Bharadwaja,  on 
his  request,  Raghava  has  now  taken  leave  of  him  and  thou  wilt 
see  him  to-morrow." 

Having  said  this,  the  illustrious  and  agile  Hanuman,  whose 
hair  stood  on  end  with  delight,  rushed  on  regardless  of  fatigue. 
Thereafter  he  crossed  the  river  sacred  to  Parasurama,  and  the 
Valukini,  Varuthi  and  Gaumati  and  the  formidable  forest  of 
Sala  Trees,  also  many  densely  populated  countries  and  opulent 
cities.  Having  journeyed  a  great  distance  that  foremost  of 
monkeys  came  to  the  flowering  trees  that  grow  in  the  neighbour- 
hood of  Nandigrama  and  resemble  those  of  Chaitaratha,  the 
gardens  of  the  King  of  the  Celestials.  There  he  beheld  people 
who,  with  their  wives,  sons  and  grandsons,  well-attired  were 
given  up  to  enjoyment  in  those  pleasant  surroundings. 

Thereafter,  at  a  distance  of  one  league  from  Ayodhya,  he 
35« 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

observed  Bharata,  clad  in  a  black  antelope  skin,  sad,  emaciated, 
wearing  matted  locks,  his  limbs  besmeared  with  dust,  dwelling 
in  a  hermitage,  afflicted  on  account  of  his  brother's  misfortune. 
living  on  fruit  and  roots,  practising  penance,  self-controlled, 
his  hair  knotted,  dressed  in  bark  and  a  black  antelope  skin, 
disciplined,  pure  of  soul,  like  unto  a  Brahmarishi  in  radiance,  he, 
having  placed  Rama's  sandals  before  him,  ruled  the  earth  by 
protecting  the  four  castes  from  every  peril  with  the  aid  of  his 
ministers,  and  virtuous  priests  and  senior  officers  wearing  red  robes 
surrounded  him.  And  his  subjects,  faithful  to  their  duty,  had 
resolved  not  to  neglect  the  welfare  of  their  king,  who  resembling, 
righteousness  itself,  seemed  to  be  the  God  of  Dharma  incarnate. 

Then  Hanuman,  paying  obeisance  with  joined  palms,  said  to 
that  loyal  prince : — 

"  Thy  brother,  Kakutstha,  for  whose  exile  to  the  Forest  of 
Dandaka  in  robes  of  bark  and  matted  locks,  thou  grievest, 
enquires  as  to  thy  welfare.  I  bring  thee  good  tidings,  O  Prince, 
abandon  thy  despair ;  the  moment  has  come  when  thou  wilt  be 
re-united  with  thy  brother  Rama.  Having  slain  Ravana  and 
recovered  Maithili,  Raghava  is  returning  with  his  valiant  friends, 
his  purpose  accomplished.  The  mighty  Lakshmana  too  is 
coming  and  the  illustrious  Vaidehi,  Rama's  devoted  companion, 
as  Sachi  is  to  Mahendra." 

Hearing  Hanuman's  words,  Bharata,  the  son  of  Kaikeyi 
swooned  with  joy,  felicity  causing  him  to  lose  consciousness.  In 
a  moment,  however,  the  descendant  of  Raghu,  Bharata,  rose  up 
breathing  with  an  effort  and  addressed  Hanuman  who  bad 
brought  him  those  pleasant  tidings.  Deeply  moved,  the  fortu- 
nate Bharata,  embracing  the  monkey  bedewed  him  with  his 
tears  that  fell  from  him  in  great  drops,  inspired  not  by  suffering 
but  by  joy,  and  said  : — 

"  Whether  thou  be  god  or  man  who  has  come  hither  out  of 
compassion  for  me,  O  My  Friend,  I  wish  to  bestow  a  gift  on  thee 
for  the  happy  tidings  thou  hast  brought  me.  I  offer  thee  a 
hundred  thousand  cows,  as  also  a  hundred  prosperous  villages 
and  sixteen  youthful  women  for  thy  consorts,  possessed  of  curls, 
with  sweet  expressions,  golden  skins,  shapely  noses,  lovely 
ankles  and  gracious  mien,  resembling  the  moon,  adorned  with 
every  kind  of  ornament,  all  of  noble  families." 

ax  357 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Hearing  from  that  Prince  of  Monkeys  of  the  miraculous  return 
of  Rama,  Bharata,  whose  desire  to  behold  his  brother  again  threw 
him  into  a  transport  of  delight,  added  joyfully : — 


CHAPTER     128 

Hanuman  tells  Bharata  of  all  that  befell  Rama  and  Sita 
during  their  exile 

"  Verily  it  is  with  joy  that  I  learn  these  tidings  of  my  protector 
after  the  innumerable  years  that  he  has  passed  in  the  forest.  How 
felicitous  is  the  well-known  saying,  '  Happiness  comes  to  man 
even  if  it  be  after  a  hundred  years ! '  How  did  Raghava  and  the 
monkeys  conclude  an  alliance  and  for  what  purpose  ?  Answer 
my  questions  candidly !  " 

Thus  interrogated  by  the  prince,  Hanuman,  seating  himself 
on  a  heap  of  Kusha  Grass,  began  to  describe  Rama's  life  in  the 
forest  and  said : — 

"  O  Lord,  thou  knowest  how  he  was  exiled  on  account  of 
the  two  boons  bestowed  on  thy  mother ;  how  the  King  Dasaratha 
died  in  consequence  of  his  son's  banishment ;  how  the  messen- 
gers, O  Lord,  brought  thee  back  from  Rajagriha  ;  how,  returning 
to  Ayodhya,  thou  didst  refuse  the  crown  ;  how  thou  didst  go 
to  Chittrakuta  to  appeal  to  thy  brother,  the  scourge  of  his  foes, 
begging  him  to  accept  the  throne,  thus  conforming  to  the  way  of 
virtuous  men ;  how  Rama  renounced  the  kingdom  and  how,  on 
returning,  thou  didst  bring  back  the  sandals  of  that  illustrious 
hero ;  all  this,  O  Long-armed  Warrior  is  well-known  to  thee  but 
what  happened  subsequent  to  thy  departure,  now  hear  from  me  ! 
"After  thy  return,  distress  seized  the  denizens  of  the  forest, 
creating  a  great  turmoil.  Thereupon  Rama,  Sita  and  Lakshmana 
entered  the  huge,  dreadful  and  lonely  Dandaka  Forest  that  was 
trodden  down  by  elephants  and  formidable  with  its  lions,  tigers 
and  deer.  Having  penetrated  into  its  depths,  the  powerful 
Viradha  appeared  before  them  emitting  fearful  cries.  Lifting 
him  up,  as  he  was  roaring  like  a  great  elephant,  those  two 
358 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

warriors  threw  him  headlong  into  a  pit  and  having  accomplished 
that  difficult  exploit}  the  two  brothers,  Rama  and  Lakshmana, 
at  dusk  reached  the  enchanting  hermitage  of  Sharabhanga.  That 
Sage  having  ascended  to  heaven,  Rama,  a  true  hero,  paid 
obeisance  to  the  ascetics  and  thereafter  went  to  Janasthana. 

"  Fourteen  thousand  titans,  who  dwelt  in  Janasthana,  were 
slain  during  the  time  that  the  mighty  Raghava  resided  there. 
For  having  fallen  into  the  hands  of  the  only  Rama,  during  the 
fourth  watch,  those  demons  were  wholly  exterminated.  Taking 
advantage  of  their  great  power,  in  order  to  harass  the  ascetics, 
those  demons,  inhabitants  of  the  Dandaka  Forest,  were  slain  by 
Rama  in  combat.  The  demons  slain  and  Khara  also,  Rama  then 
despatched  Dushana  and  subsequently  Trishiras.  Thereafter 
a  female  demon,  named  Shurpanakha,  accosted  him  and,  being 
ordered  to  do  so,  Lakshmana,  rising,  took  up  his  sword  and 
instantly  cut  off  her  ears  and  nose.  Thus  mutilated,  that  titan 
woman  took  refuge  with  Ravana. 

"  Then  a  redoubtable  titan  in  Ravana's  service,  named 
Maricha,  assuming  the  form  of  a  jewelled  deer,  beguiled  Vaidebi, 
who,  on  beholding  it,  said  to  Rama : — 

" '  O  My  Beloved,  capture  it  for  me,  it  will  enliven  our 
solitude.* 

"  Raghava,  bow  in  hand,  rushed  out  in  pursuit  of  that  deer 
and  destroyed  it  with  a  single  arrow,  O  My  Friend. 

"  While  Raghava,  however,  was  thus  engaged  in  the  chase, 
Lakshmana  too  had  left  the  hermitage,  and  Dashagriva,  entering 
there,  speedily  took  hold  of  Sita,  as  Graha  seizes  Rohini  in  the 
sky.  Slaying  the  Vulture  Jatayu,  who  sought  to  deliver  her,  the 
titan,  taking  hold  of  Sita,  departed  in  all  haste  for  his  capital. 
Meanwhile  some  strange  looking  monkeys,  as  large  as  hills, 
standing  on  the  summit  of  a  mountain,  astonished,  observed 
Ravana,  the  King  of  the  Titans  proceeding  with  Sita  in  his 
arms;  and,  mounting  into  the  sky  with  her  in  the  Chariot 
Pushpaka,  which  was  as  swift  as  thought,  the  all-powerful 
Ravana  returned  to  Lanka.  There  he  entered  his  vast  palace 
decorated  with  pure  gold  and,  with  many  words,  sought  to 
console  Vaidehi  but  she,  regarding  his  speech  and  his  person 
with  disdain  and  as  less  than  a  straw,  was  imprisoned  in  the 
Ashoka  Grove. 

359 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Meantime  Rama  returned,  having  slain  the  deer  in  the  forest 
and,  as  he  did  so,  he  beheld  the  vulture  so  beloved  of  his  sire, 
dead,  at  which  he  suffered  extreme  distress.  Thereafter  Raghava 
with  Lakshmana  set  out  in  search  of  Vaidehi  and  they  crossed 
the  Godavari  River  with  its  flowering  woodlands. 

"  In  the  great  forest,  the  two  princes  met  a  titan,  named 
Kabandha,  counselled  by  whom  that  true  hero  repaired  to  the 
Mountain  Rishyamuka  in  order  to  confer  with  Sugriva  and,  even 
before  they  met,  they  were  firm  friends. 

"  Sugriva  had  formerly  been  banished  by  his  irascible  brother 
Bali  and,  in  consequence  of  this  meeting,  a  sound  alliance  was 
formed  between  them.  Rama,  by  the  strength  of  his  arms 
established  him  on  the  throne,  having  slain  Bah,  that  giant  full 
of  valour,  in  the  field.  Regaining  his  kingdom,  Sugriva  vowed 
in  return  to  set  out  with  all  the  monkeys  in  order  to  find  the 
princess  and,  under  the  command  of  their  magnanimous 
sovereign,  ten  kotis  of  those  Flavamgamas  repaired  to  different 
regions. 

"  Whilst,  discouraged,  we  were  resting  on  the  lofty  Vindhya 
Mountain,  plunged  in  despair,  a  long  time  passed.  Meanwhile 
the  powerful  brother  of  the  King  of  the  Vultures,  named  Sampati, 
informed  us  that  Sita  was  dwelling  in  Ravana's  palace,  where- 
upon I,  whom  thou  seest  here,  was  able  to  dispel  the  grief  of  my 
companions  and,  resorting  to  mine  own  prowess,  crossed  over  a 
hundred  leagues  of  sea  and  discovered  Maithili  alone  in  the 
Ashoka  Grove,  clad  in  a  soiled  silken  cloth,  stained  with  dust, 
afflicted  yet  faithful  to  her  conjugal  vow.  Approaching  that 
irreproachable  lady  I  paid  obeisance  to  her  and  bestowed  a  ring 
on  her  in  Rama's  name  as  a  pledge,  and  she,  in  her  turn,  gave  me 
a  brilliant  jewel. 

"  My  mission  accomplished,  I  returned  and  gave  Rama  that 
token,  the  bright  gem ;  and  he,  receiving  tidings  of  Maithili, 
regained  his  zest  for  life,  as  one,  who  in  extremity,  drinks 
Amrita.  Summoning  up  his  strength,  he  resolved  to  overthrow 
Lanka,  as,  when  the  time  has  come,  Vibhabasu  prepares  to 
destroy  the  worlds. 

"  Reaching  the  shores  of  the  sea,  the  Prince  commanded  Nala 
to  construct  a  causeway  and  the  army  of  valiant  monkeys  crossed 
the  ocean  on  that  bridge.

"  Prahasta  fell  under  the  blows  of  Nila,  Kumbbakarna  under 
those  of  Raghava,  Lakshmana  slew  Havana's  son  and  Rama, 
Ravana  himself.  Having  been  received  by  the  Grantex  of  Boons, 
Shakra,  as  also  Yama,  Varuna  and  Mahadeva,  Swyambhu  and 
Dasaratha,  Rama  was  showered  with  favours  by  all  the  Risbis. 
The  glorious  Kakutstha,  Scourge  of  His  Foes,  was  rendered 
happy  by  obtaining  these  boons  and  returned  to  Kishkindha 
accompanied  by  the  monkeys  in  the  Chariot  Pushpaka. 

"  He  has  reached  the  Ganges  once  more  and  is  dwelling  with 
the  Sage,1  where  without  hindrance,  thou  sbouldst  behold  him 
to-morrow,  when  the  Pushya  Star  is  in  an  auspicious  aspect !  " 

Thereupon,  hearing  Hanuman's  delightful  words,  Bharata, 
full  of  joy,  paid  obeisance  to  him  and,  in  accents  pleasing  to  the 
heart,  said: — 

"After  a  long  time  my  desires  are  at  last  fulfilled  !  " 


chapter    129 

Bharata  sets  out  to  meet  Rama 

Hearing  those  marvellous  tidings,  Bharata,  that  real  hero,  the 
slayer  of  hostile  warriors,  delighted,  issued  a  command  to 
Shatrughna,  saying : — 

"  Let  all  righteous  men,  having  purified  themselves,  worship 
all  the  Deities  and  sacred  altars  of  the  city  with  fragrant  garlands 
and  diverse  musical  instruments.  Let  the  bards  conversant  with 
the  tradition  and  all  the  panegyrists,  with  the  queens,  ministers, 
guards,  the  army,  the  courtiers,  brahmins,  nobles  and  the  fore- 
most of  the  artisans  issue  forth  from  the  capital  in  companies,  in 
order  to  behold  the  countenance  of  Rama,  which  is  as  lovely  as 
the  moon." 

At  this  behest,  Shatrughna,  the  slayer  of  hostile  warriors, 
called  together  some  thousands  of  labourers,  whom  he  divided 
into  groups,  and  he  said  to  them : — 

"  Fill  up  the  hollows  and  level  the  uneven  ground  from 
Ayodhya  to  Nandigrama.  Sprinkle  every  part  with  water  as 
cold  as  ice  and  let  others  scatter  roasted  grain  and  flowers

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

everywhere ;  set  up  large  standards  on  all  the  main  highways  of 
the  capital.  At  the  rising  of  the  sun,  let  all  the  dwellings  be 
adorned  with  crowns  and  garlands,  with  many  flowers  and  decor- 
ations in  five  colours  ;  let  contingents  of  soldiers  stand  along 
the  royal  highway  to  keep  it  free." 

At  this  command  from  Shatrughna,  which  rilled  everyone  with 
joy,  Dhristi,  Jayanti,  Vijaya,  Siddhartha,  Arthasadhaka,  Ashoka, 
Mantrapala  and  Sumantra  set  out.  Thousands  of  elephants 
intoxicated  with  ichor  and  female  elephants  with  golden  girths, 
bearing  standards,  splendidly  adorned,  on  which  illustrious 
warriors  were  mounted,  issued  forth,  whilst  others  set  out  on 
horses  and  in  chariots  also,  and  warriors  armed  with  spears, 
cutlasses  and  nets,  furnished  with  banners  and  pennants  were 
escorted  by  the  foremost  of  their  leaders  and  thousands  of 
infantry. 

Thereafter  the  litters,  bearing  the  consorts  of  King  Dasaratha, 
with  Kaushalya  and  Sumitra  at  their  head,  also  set  out.  And 
Bharata,  ever  fixed  in  his  duty,  surrounded  by  the  Twice-born, 
the  elders  of  the  city,  the  merchants  and  counsellors  with  garlands 
and  sweetmeats  in  their  hands,  rejoiced  by  the  sound  of  conches 
and  drums,  his  praises  sung  by  panegyrists,  having  placed  the 
sandals  of  the  illustrious  Rama  on  his  head,  took  up  the  white 
parasol  decorated  with  bright  garlands  and  two  golden  chowries 
made  of  Yaks  tails,  worthy  of  a  king.  Then  that  magnanimous 
prince,  emaciated  by  long  fasting,  pale,  wearing  robes  of  bark 
and  a  black  antelope  skin,  yet  full  of  joy  at  the  tidings  of  his 
brother's  approach,  set  out  with  his  escort  to  meet  Rama  and  the 
sound  of  the  horses  hooves,  the  noise  of  the  chariot  wheels,  the 
blare  of  conches  and  beat  of  drums,  the  roaring  of  elephants,  the 
blast  of  trumpets  and  booming  of  gongs  caused  the  earth  to 
tremble  as  the  whole  city  proceeded  to  Nandigrama. 

Thereafter  Bharata,  glancing  round,  said  to  Hanuman,  the 
son  of  Pavana  : — 

"  Is  it  due  to  the  levity  of  thy  monkey  nature  that  I  do  not 
behold  Rakutstha,  the  illustrious  Rama,  Scourge  of  His  Foes  ? 
Neither  are  those  monkeys,  able  to  change  their  form  at  will,  to 
be  seen !  " 

To  these  words,  Hanuman,  testifying  to  the  truth,  answered 
the  virtue-loving  Bharata,  saying : — 
362 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

"  That  sylvan  army  has  reached  the  trees  covered  with  fruit 
and  flowers,  flowing  with  honey,  where  the  humming  of  bees 
intoxicated  with  love  can  be  heard.  All  this  was  created  by 
virtue  of  a  boon  bestowed  by  Vasava  on  the  Sage  Bharadwaja,  as 
a  reward  for  his  great  hospitality.  One  can  hear  their  shouts  of 
delight  and,  to  my  mind,  those  monkeys  have  crossed  the  River 
Gaumati.  Observe  that  immense  cloud  of  dust  near  the  wood  ; 
in  mine  estimation,  the  monkeys  are  shaking  the  boughs  of  the 
Sala  Trees ;  behold  that  aerial  chariot,  bright  as  the  moon,  which 
can  be  seen  in  the  distance,  it  is  the  celestial  Car  Fushpaka 
created  by  Brahma's  thought  and  was  obtained  by  that  hero  after 
he  had  skin  Ravana  and  his  kinsfolk.  Glittering  like  the  rising 
sun,  that  celestial  chariot,  swift  as  thought,  that  is  bearing  Rama, 
belongs  to  Dhanada,  who  received  it  from  Brahma.  In  it  are  the 
two  valiant  brothers,  offspring  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  accom- 
panied by  Vaidehi,  the  supremely  illustrious  Sugriva  and  the 
Titan  Bibishana." 

At  that  moment,  from  women,  children,  youthful  persons  and 
the  aged,  the  joyful  clamour  '  Rama  has  come !  *  arose,  reaching 
the  skies. 

Alighting  from  their  chariots,  elephants  and  horses  in  order  to 
go  on  foot,  the  people  beheld  that  prince  standing  in  his  aerial 
car,  resembling  the  moon  in  the  sky.  With  joined  palms, 
Bharata  advanced  joyfully  to  meet  Rama,  to  whom  he  paid 
obeisance,  offering  him  water  wherewith  to  wash  his  hands  and 
feet,  as  also  the  Arghya. 

In  that  chariot,  created  by  Brahma's  thought,  the  elder 
brother  of  Bharata  with  his  large  eyes,  looked  as  radiant  as  the 
God  who  bears  the  Thunderbolt.  Then  Bharata,  with  a  deep 
bow,  paid  reverence  to  his  brother  Rama,  who  was  seated  in  the 
car,  like  unto  the  sun  on  the  summit  of  Mount  Meru,  and  at 
Rama's  command,  that  swift  and  excellent  vehicle,  harnessed  to 
swans,  descended  to  earth.  Then  the  faithful  Bharata  approach- 
ing Rama,  full  of  joy  paid  obeisance  once  more,  and  Kakutstha, 
drawing  Bharata  to  him,  whom  he  had  not  seen  for  a  long  time, 
caused  him  to  sit  on  his  lap,  embracing  him  affectionately. 
Thereafter,  Bharata,  the  scourge  of  his  foes,  approached  Laksh- 
mana  and  Vaidehi  and  saluted  them  lovingly ;  then  the  son  of 
Kaikeyi  embraced  Sugriva,  Jambavan,  Angada,  Mainda, 
3<*3 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Dvivida,  Nila  and  Rishabha  also,  and  Sushena,  Nala,  Gavaksha, 
Gandhamadana,  Sharabha  and  Panasa,  clasping  them  in  turn  in 
his  anns. 

In  the  form  of  men,  those  monkeys,  able  to  change  their  shape 
at  will,  gaily  wished  Bharata  good  fortune ;  then,  after  embracing 
him,  that  prince,  full  of  valour,  said  to  Sugriva,  that  lion  among 
monkeys ; — 

"  We  are  four  brothers,  thou  shalt  be  the  fifth,  O  Sugriva ; 
benevolence  creates  friendship  and  malevolence  enmity  !  " 

Thereafter  Bharata  addressed  Bibishana  in  comforting  words, 
saying: — 

"  Be  thou  blessed  ;  thy  co-operation  ensured  the  success  of 
this  difficult  enterprise  !  " 

At  that  instant,  Shatrughna,  having  paid  obeisance  to  Rama 
and  Lakshmana,  bowed  reverently  to  the  feet  of  Sita,  Then 
Rama  approached  his  mother,  who  was  pale  and  drawn  with 
grief  and,  prostrating  himself,  touched  her  feet,  thus  rejoicing 
her  heart,  after  which  he  saluted  Sumitra  and  the  renowned 
Kaikeyi,  thereafter  paying  obeisance  to  the  other  Queens  and 
his  spiritual  preceptor. 

Then  all  the  citizens,  with  joined  palms  said  to  Rama : — 
"  Be  thou  welcome,  O  Long-armed  Hero,  thou  art  the  increaser 
of  Kaushalya's  delight !  " 

To  the  elder  brother  of  Bharata,  those  thousands  of  hands 
joined  in  salutation  caused  the  inhabitants  of  the  city  to  appear 
like  a  lotus  in  flower. 

Then  Bharata,  conversant  with  his  duty,  himself  took  Rama's 
sandals  and  fastened  them  on  the  feet  of  that  Indra  among  Men 
and  thereafter,  with  joined  palms,  said  to  him ; — 

"  This  kingdom  that  I  received  in  trust,  I  now  render  back  to 
thee  in  its  entirety.  To-day,  since  I  see  thee  as  Lord  of  Ayodhya, 
the  purpose  of  mine  existence  has  been  fulfilled  and  my  desires 
consummated.  Now  examine  thy  treasury,  thy  storehouses,  thine 
house  and  thine  army ;  by  thy  grace,  I  have  increased  them 
tenfold ! " 

These  words  uttered  by  Bharata  out  of  fraternal  love,  caused 
the  monkeys  and  the  Titan  Bibishana  to  shed  tears.    Thereafter, 
in  his  joy,  Raghava  made  Bharata  sit  on  his  lap  and,  with  his 
chariot  and  army,  proceeded  to  the  hermitage.

YUDDHA    KANDA 

Reaching  that  place  with  Bharata  and  his  troops,  Rama 
alighted  from  his  aerial  car  and  thereafter  spoke  to  that  most 
excellent  chariot,  saying : — 

"  Now  go  hence  and  place  thyself  at  Vaishravana's  disposal,  I 
give  thee  leave  to  depart." 

Thus  dismissed  by  Rama,  that  excellent  car  proceeded  in  a 
northerly  direction  and  reached  Dhanada's  abode.  The  celestial 
Car  Pushpaka,  which  had  been  borne  away  by  the  Titan  Ravana, 
returned  at  Rama's  command  with  all  speed  to  Dhanada. 

As  Shakra  touches  the  feet  of  Brihaspati,  Raghava,  having 
touched  the  feet  of  his  friend,  his  spiritual  preceptor,  seated 
himself  by  his  side,  a  little  way  apart,  on  an  excellent  seat. 


chapter    130 

Rama  is  installed  as  King  :  The  Benefits  that  accrue 
from  the  Recitation  and  Hearing  of  the  Ramayana 

Raising  his  joined  palms  to  his  forehead,  Bharata,  the  increaser 
of  Kaikeyi's  delight,  said  to  his  elder  brother,  Rama,  that  true 
hero: — 

"  Thou  hast  honoured  my  mother  by  conferring  the  kingdom 
on  me ;  now  I  give  back  to  thee  that  which  was  entrusted  to  me. 
How  can  I,  who  am  but  a  young  steer,  bear  the  heavy  load  that 
one  full  grown  is  scarcely  able  to  sustain  ?  To  my  mind,  it  is  as 
hard  to  preserve  the  boundaries  of  this  kingdom  as  to  build  up  a 
dam  which  has  been  swept  away  by  a  torrent.  How  can  a 
donkey  outpace  a  horse  or  a  crow  surpass  a  swan  in  flight  ?  Nor 
am  I  able  to  follow  in  thy  footsteps,  O  Hero,  O  Scourge  of  Thy 
Foes  !  As  a  tree  with  a  vast  trunk  and  branches,  planted  in  a 
courtyard,  that  has  grown  immense  and  difficult  to  climb,  dries 
up  when  it  has  blossomed  without  yielding  any  fruit,  so,  O  Long- 
armed  Prince,  if,  being  our  master,  thou  dost  not  uphold  us  all, 
we  thy  servants,  are  in  the  same  case  ! 

"Let  the  universe  to-day  witness  thine  enthronement}  O 
Raghava,  thou  who  art  as  radiant  as  the  sun  at  noon  in  all  its 
effulgence.  From  henceforth,  let  it  be  to  the  sound  of  gongs, 
365 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  tinkling  of  girdles  and  anklets  and  the  gentle  strains  of 
melodious  singing  that  thou  dost  wake  and  fall  asleep.  Do  thou 
rule  the  world  as  long  as  the  sun  revolves  and  the  earth  endures." 

Hearing  Bharata's  words,  Rama,  the  conqueror  of  hostile 
cities,  answered  '  So  be  it !  *  and  took  his  place  on  an  excellent 
seat. 

Thereafter,  at  the  command  of  Shatrughna,  skilled  and  deft- 
handed  barbers  quickly  surrounded  Raghava  ;  and  first  Bharata 
bathed  and  the  mighty  Lakshmana  also,  then  Sugriva,  that  Indra 
among  Monkeys,  followed  by  Bibishana,  the  Lord  of  the  Titans ; 
whereupon  Rama,  his  matted  locks  shorn,  performed  his 
ablutions  and  he  was  clothed  in  robes  of  great  price,  covered 
with  garlands  and  sprinkled  with  every  kind  of  perfume; 
thereafter  he  re-appeared  blazing  in  his  own  effulgence.  The 
hero,  Bharata,  attended  on  Rama's  robing  and  Shatrughna,  the 
upholder  of  the  prosperity  of  the  Ikshvakus,  on  Lakshmana's, 
and  all  the  consorts  of  King  Dasaratha  attended  on  Sita.  Kau- 
shalya,  in  love  of  her  son,  herself  adorned  all  the  consorts  of  the 
monkeys  with  joy. 

Then  Shatrughna,  having  issued  the  command,  Sumantra 
harnessed  a  magnificent  chariot  and  when  that  celestial  car, 
bright  as  flame,  had  been  brought  before  him,  Rama,  that  long- 
armed  warrior,  conqueror  of  hostile  citadels,  took  his  place 
therein.  Sugriva  and  Hanuman,  whose  beauty  equalled 
Mahendra's,  bathed  and  attired  in  robes  of  divine  loveliness  and 
sparkling  earrings,  followed ;  thereafter  Sugriva's  consorts,  as 
also  Sita,  advanced  eager  to  behold  the  capital. 

In  Ayodhya  all  the  ministers  of  King  Dasaratha,  with  Rama's 
spiritual  Preceptor  Vasishtha,  at  their  head,  took  counsel  as  to 
what  ought  to  be  done ;  and  Ashoka,  Vijaya  and  Siddhartha, 
with  undivided  mind,  entered  into  consultation  regarding  the 
honours  to  be  paid  to  Rama  by  the  city  and  said : — 

"  Prepare  all  that  is  needed  for  the  coronation  of  the  magnani- 
mous Rama,  who  is  worthy  of  this  honour,  beginning  with  the 
benedictory  prayer." 

Having  issued  these  orders,  the  ministers  as  also  the  spiritual 

Preceptor  set  forth  from  the  city  in  haste,  in  order  to  behold 

Rama,  who  resembled  the  God  of  a  Thousand  Eyes  in  his  chariot 

drawn  by  bay  horses.   And  Raghava,  seated  in  his  car,  proceeded 

366 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

along  the  highway  to  his  capital ;  Bharata  took  up  the  reins, 
Shatrughna  the  parasol,  Lakshmana  the  fan  and  Sugriva  one  of 
the  chowries,  whilst  that  Indra  among  the  Titans,  Bibishaaa, 
held  the  second  that  was  made  of  Yaks  tails  of  dazzling  whiteness 
and  like  unto  the  moon,  waving  it  to  and  fro  over  the  prince, 
behind  whom  he  stood.  At  that  instant,  the  sweet  music  of 
Rama's  praises  rang  out  in  the  sky  sung  by  companies  of  Rishis 
and  Gods  with  the  Marut  Hosts. 

The  illustrious  Sugriva,  that  bull  among  the  monkeys,  was 
mounted  on  an  elephant  named  Sbatrumjaya,  as  high  as  a  hill, 
and  nine  thousand  elephants  carried  the  monkeys,  who  in  the 
form  of  men,  proceeded  along  the  way,  adorned  with,  ornaments 
of  every  kind. 

Then  that  Lord  of  Men  advanced  towards  the  city  encircled 
with  palaces,  to  the  sound  of  conches  and  the  roll  of  drums  ;  and 
the  inhabitants  of  die  city  beheld  Raghava  radiant  with  beauty 
advancing  in  his  chariot,  and,  having  exchanged  salutations, 
they  took  up  their  places  behind  Kakutstha,  the  magnanimous 
Rama,  surrounded  by  his  brothers.  In  the  midst  of  his  coun- 
sellors, the  brahmins  and  the  people,  Rama  shone  with  splendour 
like  unto  the  moon  amidst  the  stars ;  and,  as  he  advanced  along 
the  highway,  preceded  by  the  musicians  and  those  who  bore  the 
Swastika  on  the  palms  of  their  hands,  he  was  attended  by  a 
joyous  crowd.  Before  Rama  marched  those  who  carried  roasted 
grain  and  gold,  and  virgins  and  kine  were  there  with  the  Twice- 
born  and  men  with  their  hands  full  of  Modaka.1 

Meantime  Rama  informed  his  ministers  of  his  alliance  with 
Sugriva  and  of  the  prowess  of  the  son  of  Anila;  and  the  monkeys 
and  the  inhabitants  of  Ayodhya  were  astounded  by  the  narrative 
concerning  the  monkeys'  exploits  and  the  valour  of  the  titans. 
Whilst  relating  these  incidents,  the  illustrious  Rama,  who  was 
attended  by  the  Vanaras,  entered  Ayodhya,  which  was  filled  with 
healthy  and  happy  people,  and  where  every  house  was  decorated. 

Thereafter  they  came  to  the  ancestral  dwelling,  the  abode  of 
the  descendants  of  Ikshvaku,  and  that  prince,  the  delight  of  the 
House  of  Raghu,  paid  obeisance  to  Kaushalya,  Sumitra  and 
Kaikeyi  and  thereafter  addressed  Bharata  in  gentle  and  reason- 
able words  saying : — 

1  Modaka— A  kind  of  sweetmeat. 

3«7 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Let  Sugriva  stay  in  the  magnificent  palace,  set  amidst  the 
woods  in  the  Ashoka  Grove,  which  abounds  in  pearls  and 
emeralds." 

At  these  words,  Bharata,  that  true  hero,  took  Sugriva  by  the 
hand  and  led  him  into  the  palace.  Meanwhile  servants  bearing 
oil  lamps,  couches  and  carpets  entered  immediately  as  comman- 
ded by  Shatrughna  and  the  exceedingly  valiant  younger  brother 
of  Raghava  said  to  Sugriva  :— 

"  Do  Thou,  O  Lord,  issue  thy  commands  for  Rama's 
coronation ! " 

On  this,  Sugriva  gave  over  four  golden  urns  encrusted  with 
gems  to  the  monkey  leaders,  saying  : — 

"  To-morrow,  at  dawn,  see  to  it  that  ye  return  with  your  urns 
filled  from  the  four  seas,  O  Monkeys." 

At  this  command,  those  powerful  monkeys,  resembling 
elephants,  immediately  rose  into  the  air,  so  that  tbey  looked  like 
swift  eagles,  and  they  were  Jambavan,  Hanuman,  Vegadarshin 
and  Rishabha,  who  brought  back  their  urns  filled  with  water, 
whilst  five  hundred  other  monkeys  drew  water  in  their  jars  from 
five  hundred  rivers.  The  mighty  and  valorous  Sushena  returned 
with  his  vessel,  adorned  with  every  variety  of  gem,  bearing 
water  from  the  eastern  sea ;  Rishabha,  without  delay,  brought 
water  from  the  southern  sea ;  Gavaya,  with  his  urn  powdered 
with  red  sandal  and  camphor,  rilled  it  at  the  vast  ocean  of  the 
west,  and  Hanuman,  the  marvellous  son  of  Anila,  who  was  as 
swift  as  the  wind,  with  his  huge  urn,  encrusted  with  diamonds, 
drew  water  from  the  icy  northern  sea. 

Beholding  the  water  brought  by  those  foremost  of  monkeys 
for  Rama's  coronation,  Shatrughna,  attended  by  servants, 
imparted  the  tidings  to  the  chief  Priest  Vasishtha,  and  his 
companions,  and  that  venerable  one  hastened  there  with  the 
brahmins,  whereupon  he  caused  Rama  accompanied  by  Sita,  to 
ascend  a  throne  inlaid  with  precious  gems.  Then  Vasishtha, 
Vijaya,  Javali,  Kashyapa,  Katyayana,  Gautama  and  Vamadeva 
consecrated  that  lion  among  men  with  pure  and  fragrant  water, 
as  the  Vasus  crowned  Vasava  of  a  Thousand  Eyes. 

Then  the  Ritvijs  and  the  Brahmins  with  sixteen  virgins, 
counsellors,  warriors,  as  also  the  merchants,  were  full  of  joy  and 
Rama  was  sprinkled  with  pure  water,  and  the  Celestial  Beings, 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

standing  in  the  firmament  with  the  Lokapalas  and  the  Gods 
assembled  to  anoint  him  with  the  juice  of  all  the  sacred  herbs. 

And  having  been  crowned  by  the  magnanimous  Vasishtha, 
the  priests  placed  royal  vestments  upon  him ;  and  Shatrughna 
bore  the  immaculate  shining  canopy,  and  Sugriva,  the  King  of 
the  Monkeys,  the  chowry  made  of  Yaks  tails,  the  Lord  of  the 
Titans,  Bibishana  carrying  the  second,  that  was  as  bright  as  the 
moon.  Thereafter,  on  Vasava's  command,  Vayu  bestowed  on 
Raghava  a  brilliant  golden  garland  embellished  with  a  hundred 
lotuses,  and  a  necklace  of  pearls  enriched  with  every  variety  of 
gem  was  also  conferred  on  that  Lord  of  Men  by  Shakra. 

The  Gods  and  Gandharvas  sang  and  troops  of  Apsaras 
danced  at  the  installation  of  the  virtuous  Rama,  who  was  worthy 
of  that  honour.  The  earth  too  was  covered  with  rich  crops  and 
the  trees  with  their  fruit  and  flowers  gave  forth  their  fragrance 
in  honour  of  Raghava.  Hundreds  and  thousands  of  horses,  cows 
and  heifers  were  distributed  amongst  the  Twice-born  by  that 
prince,  who  had  already  bestowed  hundreds  of  bulls  on  the 
brahmins  ;  and  Raghava  gave  them  thirty  crorcs  of  gold  and 
rich  attire  and  priceless  ornaments. 

Then  a  golden  crown  encrusted  with  precious  stones,  glittering 
like  the  sun's  rays,  was  offered  to  Sugriva  by  that  valiant  leader 
of  men,  who  bestowed  two  bracelets  set  with  emeralds,  the 
lustre  of  which  rivalled  the  moon's,  on  Angada,  the  son  of  Bali. 
And  Rama  gave  unto  Sita  a  necklace  of  pearls  embellished  with 
gems  that  was  without  peer  and  like  unto  moonbeams,  and 
celestial  and  immaculate  raiment  richly  embroidered  with 
superb  ornaments.  Then  Vaidehi,  the  delight  of  Janaka, 
prepared  to  bestow  her  own  necklace  on  the  son  of  the  Wind  as 
a  token  and,  unclasping  it  from  her  neck,  she  looked  on  all  the 
monkeys  and  on  her  lord  again  and  again,  whereupon  Rama, 
understanding  her  gesture  and  approving  it,  said  to  the  daughter 
of  Janaka : — 

"  Give  the  necklace  to  whom  thou  pleaseth,  O  Lovely  and 
Illustrious  Lady ! " 

Thereupon  the  dark-eyed  Sita  gave  the  necklace  to  the  son  of 
Vayu,  and  Hanuman,  in  whom  courage,  strength,  glory,  stall,  capa- 
bility and  reserve,  prudence,  audacity  and  prowess  were  ever  to  be 
found,  that  Hon  among  monkeys,  adorned  with  that  necklace, 
369 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

looked  as  radiant  as  a  mountain  covered  by  a  white  cloud 
silvered  by  an  aureole  of  moonbeams. 

Thereafter  all  die  elder  and  leading  monkeys  received  fitting 
gifts  of  jewels  and  raiment,  whereupon  Sugriva,  Hanuman, 
Jambavan  and  all  those  monkeys  having  been  overwhelmed  with 
favours  by  Rama  of  imperishable  exploits,  and  received  precious 
gems  in  addition,  according  to  their  merits,  with  all  that  their 
hearts  could  desire,  returned  joyfully  from  whence  they  had 
come ;  and  Rama,  the  scourge  of  his  foes,  lord  of  the  earth, 
sought  out  Dvivida,  Mainda  and  Nila  and  satisfied  all  their 
wishes. 

Thereupon  the  festival  which  they  had  attended  being  termi- 
nated, the  foremost  of  the  monkeys  took  leave  of  that  lord  of  men 
and  returned  to  Kishkindha.  And  Sugriva,  the  King  of  the 
Monkeys,  having  assisted  at  Rama's  coronation  and  being 
overwhelmed  with  honours  by  him,  went  back  to  his  capital. 

Thereafter,  Bibishana,  that  virtuous  monarch,  having  obtained 
the  kingdom  of  his  forbears,  returned  to  Lanka  full  of  glory 
with  the  leading  titans. 

The  supremely  illustrious  and  magnanimous  Raghava,  having 
slain  his  foes,  ruled  his  empire  in  peace,  enhancing  the  joy  of  his 
people. 

Devoted  to  virtue,  Rama  addressed  Lakshmana  who  was  fixed 
in  his  duty,  saying  :— 

"  O  Faithful  One,  aid  me  in  defending  the  land  protected  by 
the  ancient  kings  with  their  armies.  As  was  the  custom  of  our 
ancestors  in  days  of  yore,  do  thou  share  the  weight  of  state 
affairs  with  me  as  heir  presumptive." 

Yet,  despite  the  earnest  entreaties  addressed  to  him,  Saumitri 
did  not  accept  the  dignity,  and  the  high-souled  Rama  conferred 
it  on  Bharata.  Thereafter  that  prince  performed  the  Paundarika, 
Ashvamedha,  Vajimedha  and  other  sacrifices  of  many  kinds  again 
and  again.  Reigning  for  ten  thousand  years,  he  offered  up  ten 
horse  sacrifices,  distributing  immense  wealth  in  charity,  and 
Rama,  whose  arms  reached  to  his  knees,  the  powerful  elder 
brother  of  Lakshmana,  ruled  the  earth  in  glory  and  performed 
many  sacrifices  with  his  sons,  brothers  and  kinsfolk.  No  widow 
was  ever  found  in  distress  nor  was  there  any  danger  from  snakes 
or  disease  during  his  reign ;  there  were  no  malefactors  in  his 
370 


YUDDHA    KANDA 

kingdom  nor  did  any  suffer  harm ;  no  aged  person  ever  attended 
the  funeral  of  a  younger  relative ;  happiness  was  universal ; 
each  attended  to  his  duty  and  they  had  only  to  look  on  Rama  to 
give  up  enmity.  Men  lived  for  a  thousand  years,  each  having  a 
thousand  sons  who  were  free  from  infirmity  and  anxiety ;  trees 
bore  fruit  and  flowers  perpetually ;  Parjanya  sent  down  rain 
when  it  was  needed  and  Maruta  blew  auspiciously ;  all  works 
undertaken  bore  happy  results  and  all  engaged  in  their  respective 
duties  and  eschewed  evil.  All  were  endowed  with  good  qualities  ; 
all  were  devoted  to  pious  observances  and  Rama  ruled  over  the 
kingdom  for  ten  thousand  years. 

This  renowned  and  sacred  epic,  the  foremost  of  all,  granting 
long  life  and  victory  to  kings,  was  composed  by  the  Rishi  Valmiki, 
and  he  who  hears  it  constantly  in  this  world  is  delivered  from 
evil ;  if  he  desires  sons  he  obtains  them,  if  wealth  he  acquires  it. 

He  who,  in  this  world,  listens  to  the  story  of  Rama's  enthrone- 
ment, if  he  be  a  king,  will  conquer  the  earth  and  overcome  his 
enemies.  Women  will  obtain  sons  as  Sumitra  and  Kaushalya 
obtained  Rama  and  Lakshmana  and  Kaikeyi,  Bharata. 

The  hearing  of  the  '  Ramayana  '  grants  longevity  and  victory 
equal  to  Rama's,  he  of  imperishable  exploits.  The  one  who, 
mastering  his  anger,  listens  with  faith  to  this  epic,  formerly 
composed  by  Valmiki,  overcomes  all  obstacles  and  those  who 
hear  this  story  set  forth  by  Valmiki  will  return  from  their 
journeys  in  foreign  lands  and  rejoice  the  hearts  of  their  kinsfolk. 
They  will  obtain  fulfilment  of  all  the  desires  they  conceive 
in  this  world  from  Raghava,  and  its  recitation  will  bring  delight 
to  the  Celestials ;  it  pacifies  the  adverse  forces  in  those  houses 
where  it  is  to  be  found. 

Hearing  it,  a  king  will  conquer  the  earth ;  if  he  be  a  stranger 
he  will  fare  well ;  women  who  hear  this  sacred  epic  in  their 
pregnancy,  will  give  birth  to  sons  who  are  unsurpassed.  He  who 
recites  it  with  reverence  will  be  freed  from  all  evil  and  live  long. 
Warriors  should  listen  to  it  recited  by  the  Twice-born  with 
bowed  heads  in  order  to  achieve  prosperity  and  obtain  sons. 

Rama  is  ever  pleased  with  the  one  who  hears  this  epic  or  who 

recites  it  in  its  entirety  and  he  who  does  so  will  obtain  a  felicity 

comparable  to  Rama's,  who  is  Vishnu,  the  Eternal,  the  Primeval 

God,  the  Long-armed  Hari,  Narayana,  the  Lord.    Such  are  the 

371 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

fruits  produced  by  this  ancient  narrative.  May  prosperity 
attend  thee !  Recite  it  with  love  and  may  the  power  of  Vishnu 
increase ! 

The  Celestial  Beings  rejoice  in  the  understanding  and  hearing 
of  *  Ramayana  '  and  the  Ancestors  are  gratified.  Those  who,  in 
devotion,  transcribe  this  history  of  Rama,  composed  by  the 
Rishi  Valmiki,  attain  to  the  region  of  Brahma. 

The  hearing  of  this  rare  and  beautiful  poem  in  this  world 
brings  prosperous  families,  wealth  and  grain  in  abundance, 
lovely  wives,  supreme  felicity  and  complete  success  in  all 
undertakings. 

This  narrative  which  promotes  long  life,  health,  renown,

The  Sages  pay  homage  to  Rama 

When  Rama  regained  his  kingdom,  having  slain  the  titans,  all 
the  Sages  came  to  pay  him  homage. 

Kaushika,  Yavakrita,  Gargya  also,  and  Kanva,  the  son  of 
Medhatitbi,  who  dwelt  in  the  eastern  region ;  Svastiyatreya,  the 
blessed  Namuchi  and  Framuchi,  Agastya  and  Atri,  the  blessed 
Sumukha  and  Vimukha,  led  by  Agastya,  came  from  the  southern 
region,  and  Nrishangu,  Kavashin,  Dhaumya  and  the  great  Rishi 
Kausheya,  who  inhabited  the  western  region,  also  presented 
themselves  with  their  disciples;  and  Vasishtha,  Kashyapa, 
Vishvamitra,  Gautama,  Jamadagni  and  Bharadvaja  came  with 
the  seven  Rishis  who  were  established  in  the  northern  quarter. 

Reaching  the  palace  of  Raghava,  those  magnanimous  ascetics 
who  shone  like  Fire,  the  devourer  of  offerings,  presented  them- 
selves at  the  gate  and  they  were  all  conversant  with  the  Veda 
and  its  component  parts  and  versed  in  the  various  traditions. 

Addressing  himself  to  the  doorkeeper,  the  virtuous  Agastya, 
Prince  of  Sages,  said  to  him : — 

"  Let  the  arrival  of  the  ascetics  be  made  known  to  the  son  of 
Dasaratha !  " 

Thereupon  the  vigilant  guardian  of  the  door,  hearing  these 
words  from  the  Sage  Agastya,  instantly  went  away  and,  trust- 
worthy, skilled  in  the  art  of  procedure,  instructed  in  conduct 
and  gesture,  he  entered  the  presence  of  that  magnanimous 
sovereign,  who  was  as  radiant  as  the  full  moon,  and  informed 
him  of  the  arrival  of  that  Prince  of  Sages,  Agastya. 

Learning  that  those  ascetics,  who  resembled  the  rising  sun, 
had  come,  Rama  said  to  the  door-keeper : — 

"  Usher  them  in  with  all  due  respect !  " 

Thereafter,  when  the  Sages  had  entered,  Rama  rose  in  deference 
to  them  and  honoured  them  with  water  and  the  Arghya,  bestow- 
ing on  each  a  cow. 

Then  Rama,  bowing  low,  paid  obeisance  to  them  and  caused 
raised  and  costly  seats  encrusted  with  gold  to  be  brought,  that 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

were  covered  with  cushions  of  Kusha  Grass  and  antelope  skins, 
and  those  mighty  Sages  seated  themselves  according  to  rank  and, 
questioned  by  Rama  concerning  their  well-being,  the  great 
Rishis  versed  in  the  Veda,  who  were  accompanied  by  their 
disciples,  replied  to  him,  saying  : — 

**  O  Long-armed  Hero,  Joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  all  is  well 
with  us !  By  the  grace  of  heaven  we  behold  thee  happy  and 
delivered  from  thine  enemies  !  By  divine  grace,  O  King,  thou 
hast  slain  Ravana,  that  destroyer  of  the  worlds,  nor  is  it  any 
great  matter  for  thee  to  slay  Ravana  with  his  sons  and  grandsons  ! 
Furnished  with  thy  bow,  thou  canst  undoubtedly  destroy  the 
Three  Worlds  !  By  heaven's  favour,  we  behold  thee  with  Sita 
victorious  to-day.  We  see  thee  with  thy  brother  Lakshmana, 
who  is  devoted  to  thine  interests,  in  the  midst  of  thy  mothers 
and  other  brothers,  O  Virtuous  Prince.  By  the  grace  of  heaven, 
the  Rangers  of  the  Night,  Prahasta,  Vikata,  Virupaksha, 
Mahodara,  Akampana  and  Durdharsha  have  perished.  By 
divine  grace,  O  Rama,  Kumbhakarna,  he,  whose  monstrous 
form  had  no  equal  in  the  world,  was  overthrown  by  thee  in 
combat.  Trishiras,  Atikaya,  Devantaka  and  Narantaka,  those 
mighty  night  rangers,  were  struck  down  by  thee,  O  Rama.  By 
the  grace  of  heaven,  thou  didst  measure  thy  strength  against 
that  Indra  of  Titans  whom  the  Gods  themselves  were  unable  to 
destroy  and  didst  vanquish  him  in  single  combat.  Assuredly 
it  was  no  small  matter  for  thee  to  overcome  Ravana  in  fight  but, 
by  divine  grace,  thou  wast  able  to  join  issue  with  Ravani  and,  in 
combat,  slay  him  also. 

"  Once  thou  wast  delivered  from  his  magic  bonds,  O  Long- 
armed  Hero,  by  heaven's  favour,  thou  didst  triumph  over  that 
enemy  of  the  Gods  who  bore  down  on  thee  like  Time  itself! 
We  marvelled  to  learn  of  the  death  of  Indrajita  !  By  granting 
us  the  sacred  and  agreeable  gift  of  security,  thou  hast  enhanced 
thy  victory,  O  Kafcutstha,  O  Scourge  of  Thy  Foes  !  " 

Hearing  those  pure-souled  Sages  speak  thus,  Rama  was 
extremely  surprised  and,  with  joined  palms,  answered  them, 
saying: — 

"O  Blessed  Ones,  I  vanquished  Kumbhakarna  and  that 
Ranger  of  the  Night,  Ravana,  both  of  whom  were  filled  with 
valour,  why,  therefore,  do  you  praise  me  particularly  on  account 
376 


UTTARA    KANDA 

of  Ravani  ?  Since  I  vanquished  Mahodara,  Prahasta,  the  Titan 
Virupaksha,  also  Matta  and  Unmatta  who  were  both  invincible, 
and  those  great  warriors,  Devantaka  and  Narantaka,  why  this 
commendation  on  Indrajita's  account?  Did  I  not  overcome 
those  Rangers  of  the  Night,  Atikaya,  Trishiras  and  Dhumraksha 
who  were  full  of  courage  ?  Why,  therefore,  do  you  extol  me 
because  of  Ravani  ?  In  what  lay  his  special  power,  strength  and 
prowess  ?  How  was  he  superior  to  Ravana  ?  If  I  may  learn  it, 
for  this  is  no  command  I  lay  upon  you,  if  it  be  no  secret  that 
you  may  not  reveal,  I  desire  to  know  it,  therefore  speak! 
Shakra  himself  was  vanquished  by  him ;  in  virtue  of  what  boon 
and  from  what  source  did  the  son  derive  those  powers  that  his 
sire  Ravana,  did  not  possess  ?  From  whence  did  this  titan  gain 
pre-eminence  over  his  father  in  combat  ?  How  was  he  able  to 
triumph  over  Indra  ?  Tell  me  now  of  all  the  boons  he  received, 
O  Foremost  of  the  Sages  !  " 


CHAPTER    2 

The  Birth  of  Vishravas 

Thus  questioned  by  the  magnanimous  Raghava,  the  illustrious 
Kumbhayoni  answered  as  follows  : — 

'*  Learn,  O  Rama,  of  the  brilliant  exploits  of  that  warrior  and 
how  he  slew  his  adversaries  without  being  wounded  by  them ; 
but  first  I  shall  tell  thee  of  Ravana's  birth  and  lineage,  O 
Raghava,  and  thereafter  of  the  rare  boon  accorded  to  his  son. 

"  In  former  times,  during  the  Kritayuga,  there  lived  a  son  of 
Prajapati,  O  Rama,  and  that  lord,  Poulastya  by  name,  was  a 
Paramarishi  equal  to  the  Grandsire  of  the  World  Himself.  One 
is  unable  to  enumerate  all  the  virtues  he  owed  to  his  excellent 
character  and  it  is  sufficient  to  say  that  he  was  the  son  of 
Prajapati  and,  as  such,  was  the  favourite  of  the  Gods.  He  was 
beloved  of  the  entire  world  on  account  of  his  charming  qualities 
and  great  wisdom.  In  order  to  pursue  his  ascetic  practices,  that 
foremost  of  Munis  repaired  to  the  hermitage  of  Trinabindu  and 
took  up  his  abode  on  the  slopes  of  the  great  Mountain  Mem. 
377 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

There,  that  virtuous  soul,  his  senses  fully  controlled,  gave  him- 
self up  to  the  practice  of  austerity,  but  some  youthful  maidens, 
whose  fathers  were  Rishis,  Pannagas  and  Rajarishis,  wandering 
in  those  solitudes,  disturbed  bim.  Accompanied  by  Apsaras, 
they  came  to  divert  themselves  in  that  place  and,  as  it  was 
possible  to  find  fruits  in  every  season  and  disport  oneself  in 
those  woods,  the  young  girls  constantly  went  there  to  play. 
Attracted  by  the  charms  of  Poulastya's  retreat,  they  sang, 
played  their  instruments  and  danced,  thus  in  full  innocence, 
distracting  the  hermit  from  the  exercise  of  his  penances. 

"  On  this,  that  mighty  and  exalted  Sage  cried  out  in  indigna- 
tion : — 

" (  She  who  rails  under  my  gaze,  will  instantly  conceive ! ' 

"  Thereupon  all  those  maidens,  who  heard  the  magnanimous 
Sage,  terrified  of  the  brahmin's  curse,  left  that  place ;  but  the 
daughter  of  the  Sage  Trinabindu  had  not  heard  it.  Entering 
the  wood,  wandering  here  and  there  without  fear,  she  was 
unable  to  find  the  companions  who  had  accompanied  her. 

"At  that  moment  the  illustrious  and  mighty  Rishi,  born  of 
Prajapati,  was  concentrating  on  the  sacred  scriptures,  his  soul 
purified  by  asceticism.  Hearing  the  recitation  of  the  Veda,  that 
youthful  maiden  approached,  and  beholding  that  treasury  of 
asceticism,  she  instantly  grew  pale  and  manifested  all  the  signs 
of  pregnancy.  Thereupon,  discovering  her  condition,  she 
became  extremely  bewildered  and  said  : — 
"  *  What  has  happened  to  me  ?  '  Thereafter,  realising  the  truth, 
she  returned  to  her  father's  hermitage. 

**  On  seeing  her  in  that  state,  Trinabindu  said : — *  What  means 
this  strange  condition  in  which  thou  dost  find  thyself? ' 

"  Thereat,  with  joined  palms,  the  unfortunate  girl  answered 
that  treasury  of  asceticism,  saying : — 

"  '  I  do  not  know,  Dear  Father,  what  has  brought  me  to  this 
pass.  Preceded  by  my  companions,  I  had  gone  to  visit  the 
sacred  hermitage  of  that  great  and  pure-souled  Rishi  Poulastya. 
Thereafter  I  was  unable  to  find  any  of  those  who  had  accom- 
panied me  to  the  woods  but,  perceiving  the  alteration  in  my 
body,  seized  with  fear,  I  returned  here.' 

"  Then  that  Rajarishi  Trinabindu,  of  radiant  aspect,  entered 
into  meditation  awhile  and  it  was  revealed  to  him  that  this  was 
378 


UTTARA    KANDA 

the  work  of  the  ascetic  and,  the  curse  of  that  great  and  pure- 
souled  Sage  having  been  made  clear  to  him,  he,  taking  his 
daughter,  went  to  where  Poulastya  was  to  be  found  and  said  to 
him: — 

" '  O  Blessed  One,  accept  this  daughter  of  mine  in  all  her 
native  perfection  as  alms  spontaneously  offered.  O  Great  Rishi, 
assuredly  she  will  ever  be  completely  obedient  to  thee  who  art 
given  to  the  practice  of  asceticism  and  to  the  mortification  of  the 


"  Hearing  the  words  of  the  virtuous  Rajarishi,  that  Twice- 
born  One,  who  was  willing  to  accept  the  young  girl,  said  : — *  It 
is  well ! '  and,  having  given  his  daughter  to  that  king  of  Sages, 
Trinabindu  returned  to  his  hermitage  whilst  the  young  wife 
remained  with  her  consort,  gratifying  him  with  her  virtue.  Her 
character  and  conduct  so  charmed  that  powerful  and  exalted 
Sage  that,  in  his  delight,  he  addressed  her,  saying : — 

"  *  O  Lady  of  lovely  limbs,  I  am  well  pleased  with  thine  out- 
standing virtues  and  will  confer  on  thee  a  son  like  unto  myself 
who  will  perpetuate  both  our  houses  ;  he  will  be  known  by  the 
name  of  Poulastya  and,  as  thou  hast  listened  to  me  reciting  the 
Veda,  he  will  also  be  called  Vishravas.'1 

"  Thus,  his  heart  filled  with  delight,  did  the  ascetic  speak  to 
his  divine  consort  and,  in  a  short  time,  she  gave  birth  to  a  son, 
Vishravas,  who  was  famed  in  the  Three  Worlds  and  full  of  glory 
and  piety.  Learned,  looking  on  all  with  an  equal  eye,  happy  in 
the  fulfilment  of  his  duty,  like  unto  his  sire  inclined  to  asceticism, 
such  was  Vishravas. 

1  From  the  root '  Sru  ',  to  listen. 


CHAPTER    3 

Vishravas  becomes  the  Protector  of  Wealth 

"  The  son  of  Poulastya,  that  foremost  of  Munis,  was  not  long  in 
establishing  himself  in  asceticism  like  his  sire.    Loyal,  virtuous, 
devoted  to  the  study  of  the  Veda,  pure,  detached  from  all  the 
pleasures  of  life,  bis  duty  was  his  constant  aim, 
379 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Hearing  of  the  life  he  was  leading,  the  great  Muni  Bharad  wa  ja 
gave  his  own  daughter  of  radiant  complexion  to  him  and 
Vishravas  accepted  Bharadwaja's  daughter  with  traditional  rites 
and  began  to  consider  how  he  might  perpetuate  his  line  and 
happiness.  In  extreme  delight,  that  foremost  of  the  ascetics, 
conversant  with  his  duty,  begot  with  his  wife  a  wonderful  child 
full  of  vigour,  endowed  with  all  the  brahmic  qualities.1 

"  At  the  birth  of  this  child,  his  paternal  grandfather  was  filled 
with  joy,  and  Poulastya,  beholding  him,  bethought  himself  how 
he  might  make  him  happy.  *  He  shall  become  the  "  Guardian 
of  Wealth  ",'  he  said  in  bis  delight,  which  was  shared  by  all  the 
Sages,  and  he  gave  him  a  name,  saying : — 

"  *  Since  the  child  resembles  Vishravas,  he  shall  be  known  as 
Vaishravana ! ' 

"  Thereafter  Vaishravana,  retiring  to  pastoral  solitudes,  grew 
up  to  resemble  the  mighty  Anala,  who  is  invoked  at  the  time  of 
sacrifice  and,  while  he  sojourned  in  that  retreat,  the  thought 
came  to  that  magnanimous  one,  *  I  will  pursue  my  supreme 
duty ;  the  path  of  duty  is  the  highest  path '. 

"  For  a  thousand  years  he  gave  himself  up  to  asceticism  in  the 
great  forest  and  practising  severe  austerities,  performed  heavy 
penances.  At  the  end  of  a  thousand  years,  he  underwent  the 
following  discipline — drinking  water,  he  fed  on  air  alone  or  took 
no  nourishment  whatsoever.  A  thousand  ages  passed  like  a 
single  year,  whereupon  the  mighty  Brahma,  accompanied  by  the 
Hosts  of  the  Gods  and  their  leaders,  came  to  the  hermitage  and 
said  to  him : — 

" '  I  am  highly  gratified  with  thine  accomplishments,  O 
Devoted  Son,  now  choose  a  boon  !  May  prosperity  attend  thee ; 
thou  dost  merit  a  favour,  O  Sage  1  * 

"Then  Vaishravana  answered  the  Grandsire  of  the  World,  who 
stood  near  and  said : — 

*' '  O  Blessed  One,  I  desire  to  be  the  saviour  and  protector  of 
the  world !  * 

"  In  the  satisfaction  of  his  soul,  Brahma,  who  was  accompanied 
by  the  Celestial  Host,  joyfully  answered  : — *  So  be  it !  It  is  my 
desire  to  create  four  Guardians  of  the  Worlds.  Now  there  shall 
be  the  region  of  Yama,  the  region  of  Indra,  the  region  of  Varuna 

1  Such  as  self-control,  purity,  austerity,  etc. 

3«o

and  the  one  sought  by  thee.  Go,  O  Virtuous  Ascetic,  and  reign 
over  the  dominion  of  wealth  !  With  Shakra,  Varuna,  the  Lord 
of  the  Waters,  and  Yama,  thou  shalt  be  the  fourth.  Receive  as 
thy  vehicle  this  chariot  named  Pushpaka,  which  is  as  bright  as 
the  sun,  and  be  equal  to  the  Gods.  Be  happy,  we  shall 
now  return  from  whence  we  came,  having  accomplished  that 
which  we  had  to  do  by  conferring  this  double  gift,  O  Dear 
Son!' 

"  With  these  words,  Brahma  withdrew  to  the  region  of  the  Gods 
and  when  the  Celestial  Host,  with  the  Grandsire  at  their  head, 
had  gone  to  the  heavenly  region,  Vaishravana,  having  become 
the  Lord  of  Wealth,  humbly  addressed  his  sire  with  joined 
palms  and  said : — 

" '  O  Blessed  One,  I  have  received  a  rare  boon  from  the  Grand- 
sire  of  the  World,  but  the  divine  Prajapati  has  not  assigned  me  a 
dwelling  place ;  do  thou  therefore  counsel  me,  O  Blessed  One, 
O  Lord,  as  to  where  an  agreeable  retreat  may  be  found  where 
no  suffering  comes  to  any  living  being.' 

"  At  these  words  of  his  son,  Vaishravana,  the  foremost  of  the 
ascetics  answered  saying : — 

"  *  Hear,  O  Most  Virtuous  of  Men !  On  the  shores  of  the  ocean, 
to  the  south  there  is  a  mountain  named  Trikuta.  On  its  lofty 
summit,  which  is  as  great  as  the  capital  of  the  mighty  Indra,  the 
ravishing  City  of  Lanka  was  constructed  by  Vishvakarma  for  the 
Rakshasas  and  it  resembles  Amaravati.  Do  thou  dwell  in 
Lanka  and  be  happy  !  Do  not  hesitate !  With  its  moats, 
golden  walls,  engines  of  war  and  the  weapons  with  which  it  is 
filled,  with  its  gold  and  emerald  archways,  that  city  is  a  marvel! 
The  Rakshasas  left  it  formerly  in  fear  of  Vishnu  and  it  is  deserted, 
all  the  demons  having  gone  to  the  nethermost  region.  Now 
Lanka  is  empty  and  has  no  protector.  Go  and  inhabit  it,  My 
Son,  and  be  happy  !    No  harm  will  visit  thee  there.' 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  his  sire,  the  virtuous  Vaishravana  went 
to  dwell  in  Lanka  on  the  summit  of  the  mountain,  and  soon, 
under  his  rule,  it  was  filled  with  thousands  of  delighted  Nairritas 
disporting  themselves. 

"  That  righteous  King  of  the  Nairritas,  the  blessed  Sage 
Vaishravana,  dwelt  in  Lanka,  that  city  surrounded  by  the  sea 
and,  from  time  to  time,  the  saintly  Lord  of  Wealth,  in  the

Pushpaka  Chariot,  went  to  visit  his  father  and  mother.  Hymned 
by  the  Hosts  of  the  Gods  and  Gandharvas  and  entertained  by 
the  dances  of  the  Apsaras,  that  Guardian  of  Wealths  radiating 
glory  like  unto  the  sun,  went  to  visit  his  sire.  " 


CHAPTER   4 

Origin  of  the  Rakskasas  and  of  the  Boons  they  received 

This  discourse  of  Agastya  filled  Rama  with  astonishment. 
"  How  was  it  that  the  Rakshasas  formerly  dwelt  in  Lanka  ?  ", 
such  was  the  question  that  Rama  put  to  the  ascetic,  shaking  his 
head  and  casting  wondering  glances  upon  him  from  time  to 
time. 

He  said : — '*  O  Blessed  One,  the  words  '  Formerly  Lanka 
belonged  to  the  Eaters  of  Flesh  '  from  thy  lips  causes  me  extreme 
surprise.  We  have  been  told  that  the  Rakshasas  were  the 
offspring  of  Poulastya  and  now,  thou  afiirmest  that  they  owe 
their  origin  to  a  different  source.  Were  Ravana,  Kumbhakarna, 
Prahasta,  Vikata  and  Ravani  stronger  than  they?  Who,  O 
Brahmin,  was  their  first  king  ?  What  was  the  name  of  that  one 
of  terrific  strength  ?  For  what  fault  were  they  driven  out  by 
Vishnu  ?  Tell  me  all  in  detail,  O  Irreproachable  Sage  and,  as 
the  sun  chases  away  the  shade,  so  dispel  my  curiosity  !  " 

Hearing  Raghava's  fair  and  eloquent  words,  Agastya,  amazed, 
answered  : — 

"  Formerly  Prajapati  created  the  waters,  choosing  that 
element  as  his  source  and,  thereafter,  in  order  to  protect  it,  that 
lotus-bora  One  generated  all  creatures.  Then  those  beings, 
tormented  by  hunger  and  thirst,  humbly  presented  themselves 
before  their  author  and  enquired  saying  : — 

"  *  What  shall  we  do  ?  * 

"  Whereupon  Prajapati,  smiling,  gave  this  answer  to  them  all : — 

'  Protect  the  waters  carefully,  O  Sons  of  Manu !  *    Then 
some  said  : — '  Rakshami  *  (we  will  protect)  and  others  '  Yak- 
shami  *  (we  will  sacrifice).    Thus  addressed  by  those  afflicted 
by  hunger  and  thirst,  the  Creator  said  : — 
3»2 


UTTARA    KANDA 

" '  Those  among  you  who  have  said  "  Rakshami "  shall  be 
Rakshasas  and  those  among  you  who  have  said  "Yakshami" 
shall  be  Yakshas.' 

"  On  this,  two  brothers  sprang  up,  named  Heti  and  Praheti,  the 
equals  of  Madhu  and  Kaitabha,  who  were  Rakshasas,  oppressors 
of  their  foes ;  and  the  righteous  Praheti  withdrew  to  the  soli- 
tudes to  practice  asceticism,  but  Heti  did  all  in  his  power  to  find 
a  wife  and,  immeasurably  intelligent  and  of  great  wisdom,  he 
espoused  the  sister  of  Kala,  a  young  girl  named  Bhaya,1  who  was 
exceedingly  terrifying ;  and  that  foremost  of  those  possessing 
sons  begot  a  son  by  the  name  of  Vidyutkesha. 

"  The  son  of  Heti,  Vidyutkesha,  was  possessed  of  the  splendour 
of  the  sun  and  grew  like  a  lotus  in  a  lake  and  that  ranger  of  the 
night,  having  reached  the  bloom  of  youth,  his  sire  resolved  that 
he  should  wed.  In  the  interests  of  his  son  he  sought  out  the 
daughter  of  Sandhya,  who  was  his  equal  in  beauty,  and  Sandhya, 
reflecting  *  a  daughter  must  inevitably  be  given  to  some  stranger  ' 
gave  her  to  Vidyutkesha  in  marriage,  O  Raghava. 

"  Vidyutkesha,  that  ranger  of  the  night,  having  received  the 
daughter  of  Sandhya,  began  to  divert  himself  with  her  as 
Magna  vat  with  the  daughter  of  Paulomi.  After  a  time,  O  Rama, 
Salatantaka  was  filled  with  child,  as  a  cloud  is  charged  with 
water  from  the  ocean. 

"  Repairing  to  the  Mandara  Mountain,  the  Rakshasi  brought 
forth  a  child  who  was  as  beautiful  as  a  cloud,  even  as  Ganga  had 
been  delivered  of  an  infant  by  the  God  of  Fire.  Having  given 
birth  to  that  child,  she  again  desired  to  disport  herself  with 
Vidyutkesha  and,  forsaking  her  son,  she  rejoined  her  consort. 
Then  the  infant  who  had  just  been  born  and  was  as  radiant  as 
the  autumnal  sun,  whose  voice  resembled  the  rumbling  of  a 
cloud,  placing  his  fist  in  his  mouth, cried  for  a  long  time,  and 
Shiva,  who  was  following  the  Path  of  the  Wind,  mounted  on 
his  bull  and  accompanied  by  Parvati,  heard  the  sound  of  weeping 
and  with  Uma  beheld  the  son  of  the  Rakshasi  who  was  crying. 
Allowing  himself  to  be  moved  by  compassion  by  his  consort, 
Bhava,  the  Destroyer  of  Tripura,  made  him  equal  to  his  mother 
in  age  and  bestowed  immortality  upon  him.  Thereafter  the 
unchanging  and  imperishable  Mahadeva  bestowed  an  aerial  car 

1  Bhaya — Fear.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

upon  him  that  traversed  space,  in  order  to  gratify  Parvati,  and 
she,  on  her  side,  also  conferred  a  boon  on  him,  saying : — 

"  '  The  Rakshasas  shall  conceive  instantly  and  give  birth  as 
they  conceive ;  their  children  shall  at  once  attain  the  age  of 
their  mothers.' 

"  Thereafter  the  highly  intelligent  Sukesha,  proud  of  the 
favours  he  had  received,  having  obtained  this  great  fortune  from 
the  Lord  Hara,  began  to  range  everywhere,  displaying  himself 
in  his  aerial  car  and  resembling  Purandara  when  he  obtained 
heaven. 


chapter   5 

The  Story  of  the  three  Sons  of  Sukesha 

"  A  gandharva  named  Gramani,  who  was  as  effulgent  as  fire,  had 
a  daughter  named  Devavati  in  all  the  beauty  of  her  youth, 
famed  in  the  Three  Worlds,  equal  to  a  second  Shri,1  and  that 
virtuous  Gandharva,  beholding  Sukesha  to  be  thus  endowed,  gave 
her  to  him  as  a  second  Shri  of  whom  he  was  the  guardian. 

"Approaching  her  beloved  consort,  who  had  attained  a  sovereign 
state  by  virtue  of  the  boons  he  had  received,  as  a  mendicant  on 
whom  wealth  has  been  conferred,  Devavati  was  highly  delighted. 
United  to  that  woman,  the  ranger  of  the  night  appeared  as 
majestic  as  a  great  elephant,  the  offspring  of  Aryama.  In  time 
Sukesha  became  a  father,  O  Raghava,  and  begot  three  sons,  the 
equals  of  the  Three  Sacrificial  Fires,  Malyavan,  Sumali  and 
Mali,  the  foremost  of  herpes,  rivals  of  the  Three-eyed  God ; 
such  were  the  sons  of  the  Sovereign  of  the  Rakshasas.  In 
repose,  they  resembled  the  Three  worlds,  in  action,  they  were 
like  unto  the  three  Sacrificial  Fires,'  as  powerful  as  the  Three 
Vedas  and  as  formidable  as  the  three  humours  of  the  body.3 
"  These  three  sons  of  Sukesha,  shining  like  three  fires,  throve  like 

1  Shri — The  Goddess  of  Prosperity,  Lakshmi. 

•Three    Sacrificial    Fires — Garhapatya,    Ahavaniya    and    Dakshina.     See

diseases  that  have  been  neglected  and,  learning  of  the  boons 
their  sire  had  received,  which  had  led  him  to  increased  sover- 
eignty and  which  he  owed  to  his  asceticism,  the  three  brothers 
repaired  to  Mount  Mem  in  order  to  practice  penance. 

"  Adopting  a  rigid  and  formidable  course  of  austerity,  O 
Foremost  of  Monarchs,  those  Rakshasas  gave  themselves  up  to 
fearful  mortifications,  sowing  terror  among  all  beings.  On 
account  of  their  penances,  faith,  virtue  and  equanimity,  scarce  to 
be  witnessed  on  earth,  they  agitated  the  Three  Worlds  with  the 
Gods,  Asuras  and  men. 

"  Then  the  Four-faced  Deity,1  in  his  marvellous  chariot,  came 
to  pay  homage  to  the  sons  of  Sukesha  and  said : — 

"  *  It  is  I  who  am  the  conferrer  of  boons  ! ' 

"  Whereupon  they,  recognizing  him  to  be  Brahma,  the  Dispens- 
er of  Favours,  who  was  accompanied  by  the  Indras  and  their 
Hosts,  with  joined  palms,  shaking  like  trees,  answered  hira, 
saying : — 

" '  If  our  penance  has  found  favour  with  thee,  O  Lord,  then 
grant  us  the  boons  of  remaining  invincible,  of  destroying  our 
enemies,  of  living  long,  of  becoming  powerful  and  of  being 
devoted  to  one  another.' 

"'  Let  it  be  so !'"  replied  the  God,  who  was  a  lover  of  brahmins, 
to  the  sons  of  Sukesha  and  he  returned  to  Brahmaloka.  There- 
upon those  rangers  of  the  night,  O  Rama,  who  had  become 
supremely  arrogant  on  account  of  the  boons  they  had  received, 
began  to  harass  the  Gods  and  Asuras,  and  the  Celestials  with  the 
companies  of  Rishis  and  Charanas,  being  thus  persecuted 
and  having  no  protector  with  whom  they  could  take  refuge, 
resembled  beings  in  hell. 

"  Meantime,  O  Prince  of  Raghu,  the  three  Rakshasas  sought  out 
the  immortal  Vishvakarma,  the  foremost  of  architects  and 
joyously  said  to  him : — 

" '  O  Thou,  who  from  thine  own  resources,  created  the  palaces 
of  the  great  Gods,  strong,  dazzling  and  impregnable,  do  thou  in 
thy  transcendent  intelligence  construct  a  dwelling  for  us  of  our 
own  choosing  on  the  Himavat,  Meru  or  Mandara  Mountains. 
Build  us  a  vast  abode  equal  to  that  belonging  to  Maheshvara.* 

"  Then  the  mighty-armed  Vishvakarma  spoke  to  the  Rakshasas 

1  Four-faced  Deity — Brahma. 

385 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

concerning  a  residence  equal  to  Indra's  Amaravati  and  said  : — 
"  *  On  the  shores  of  the  southern  sea  there  is  a  mountain  named 
Trikuta  and  there  is  also  another  named  Suvela,  O  Princes  of  the 
Rakshasas.  On  the  central  peak  resembling  a  cloud,  inaccessible 
even  to  birds  and  which  is  hewn  on  four  sides,  is  a  city  of  thirty 
leagues  in  extent,  covering  a  space  of  a  hundred  leagues  in  length. 
Surrounded  by  golden  walls,  pierced  by  gateways  and  furnished 
with  terraces  of  gold,  it  is  called  Lanka,  and  was  constructed  by 
me  at  Shakra's  command.  Go  and  establish  yourselves  in  that 
city,  O  Invincible  Rakshasas,  as  the  inhabitants  of  heaven  dwell 
in  Amaravati.  When  you  occupy  that  Citadel  of  Lanka  with  the 
innumerable  Rakshasas  who  surround  you,  none  will  be  able  to 
expel  you  and  you  will  overcome  your  foes.' 

"  Thus  counselled  by  Vishvakarma,  the  foremost  of  the  Rak- 
shasas followed  by  thousands  of  their  companions  went  to 
inhabit  the  City  of  Lanka.  Surrounded  by  strong  walls  and  deep 
moats,  it  was  filled  with  hundreds  of  golden  palaces  and  there 
the  rangers  of  the  night  began  to  dwell  in  great  felicity. 

"  At  that  time,  there  lived  a  Gandharvi  named  Narmada,  O 
Descendant  of  Raghu,  and  she  had  three  daughters  born  of  her 
own  will,  who  were  as  lovely  as  Shri  or  Kirti.  Though  not  of 
their  race,  she  gave  her  three  daughters,  whose  faces  were  as 
radiant  as  the  full  moon,  to  those  three  Indras  among  the 
Rakshasas,  The  youthful  Gandharvis  of  supreme  attraction 
were  wedded  by  their  mother  under  the  Uttara  Fhalguni 
Constellation,  which  is  presided  over  by  the  Deity  Bhaga.1 
"  Having  accepted  their  wives,  O  Rama,  the  sons  of  Sukesha 
diverted  themselves  with  them,  as  the  Celestials  sport  with  the 
Apsaras.  And  the  consort  of  Malyavan,  Sundari*  in  name  and 
nature,  gave  birth  to  many  sons — Vajramushti,  Virupaksha, 
Durmukha,  Suptagna,  Yajnakopa,  Matta  and  Unmatta. 
Sundari  had  a  daughter  also,  O  Rama,  the  lovely  Anala. 

"  On  her  side,  the  consort  of  Sumali,  whose  complexion 
resembled  the  full  moon,  was  called  Katumati  and  she  was 
dearer  to  him  than  his  own  life.  I  wul  enumerate  the  offspring 
that  ranger  of  the  night  begot  with  her  according  to  their  birth, 

0  Great  King : — 

1  Bhaga — An  Aditya  regarded  in  the  Veda  as  presiding  over  love  and  marriage. 
1  Sundari — The  name  means  '  Beautiful '.

"They  were — Prahasta,  Akampana,  Vikata,  Kalikamukha, 
Dhumraksha,  Danda,  Suparshwa  of  great  energy,  Samhradi, 
Praghasa,  Bhasakarna,  Raka,  Pashpotkala,  Kaikasi  of  gracious 
smiles  and  Kumbhanasi.  These,  we  are  told,  were  the  off- 
spring of  Suraali. 

"  Mali's  wife  was  the  Gandharvi  named  Vasuda,  who  was 
supremely  graceful,  whose  eyes  resembled  lotus  petals  and  who 
rivalled  the  most  ravishing  of  the  Yakshis.  Hear,  O  Lord 
Raghava,  and  I  will  tell  thee  of  the  offspring  the  youngest 
brother  begot  with  her ;  they  were  Anala,  Anila,  Hara  and 
Sampati ;  these  sons  of  Mali  became  the  counsellors  of 
Bibishana. 

"  Meanwhile,  those  foremost  of  night-rangers  surrounded  by 
hundreds  of  their  sons,  in  the  intoxication  of  their  extreme 
strength,  harassed  the  Gods  and  their  leaders  with  the  Rishis, 
Nagas  and  Yakshas.  Ranging  the  earth,  irresistible  as  the 
tempest,  ruthless  as  death  in  combat,  overweeningly  proud  of 
their  boons,  they  constantly  impeded  the  sacrifices  of  the  Sages. 


CHAPTER    6 

Vishnu  goes  to  the  defence  of  the  Gods 

«  thus  afflicted,  the  Gods  and  Rishis,  those  treasuries  of  asceti- 
cism, terror-stricken,  sought  refuge  with  the  God  of  Gods, 
Maheshwara,  He  Who  creates  and  destroys  the  universe,  the 
Inner  Ruler,  Who  is  unmanifest,  the  substratum  of  the  worlds, 
the  supreme  Guru,  adored  by  all.  And  the  Gods,  coming  to 
that  enemy  of  Kama,1  the  Destroyer  of  Tripura,  addressed  him 
in  a  voice  shaking  with  fear,  and  said  : — 

" '  O  Bhagawat,  the  sons  of  Sukesha,  wrought  up  with  pride  on 
account  of  the  boons  they  have  received  from  the  Grandsire  of 
the  World,  those  scourgers  of  their  foes,  are  oppressing  the 
children  of  the  Lord  of  Creatures.  Our  dwellings,  which  should 
be  our  refuge,  no  longer  afford  us  shelter ;  having  driven  out

wara was  burnt  to  ashes  by  him  by  a  single  glance  from  his  third  eye.

the  Gods  from  heaven,  they  themselves  assume  the  rdle  of  Gods. 
"IamVishnu",,,IamRudra".MIamBrahma"."  lam  the  King 
of  the  Gods  ", "  I  am  Yama  ", "  I  am  Varuna  ", "  I  am  the  Moon  ", 
"  Verily,  I  am  the  Sun  ",  thus  do  Mali,  Sumali  and  Malyavan 
speak,  those  Rakshasas,  formidable  in  combat,  who  harass  us 
as  also  those  who  precede  them.  We  are  terrified,  O  Lord, 
deliver  us  from  fear ;  do  thou  assume  a  terrible  form  and  subdue 
those  thorns  in  the  side  of  the  Gods." 

"  On  this  prayer  from  the  united  Gods  being  addressed  to 
Kapardin,1  of  reddish  hue,  he,  in  deference  to  Sukesha  answered 
the  Celestial  Host,  saying : — 

"  *  Kay,  I  shall  not  destroy  these  Rakshasas ;  I  am  not  able  to 
slay  them,  O  Ye  Gods,  but  I  shall  unfold  to  you  how  you  may 
rid  yourselves  of  them !  This  step  having  been  taken,  O 
Maharishis,  go  and  seek  refuge  with  the  Lord  Vishnu  who  will 
himself  destroy  them  !  * 

"  Thereupon,  offering  obeisance  to  Maheshwara,  with  jubilant 
cries  they  presented  themselves  before  Vishnu,  though  filled  with 
terror  on  account  of  those  rangers  of  the  night. 

"  Bowing  down  to  the  God  who  bears  the  conch  and  discus, 
they  paid  him  great  homage  and,  in  trembling  tones,  denounced 
the  sons  of  Sukesha,  saying  : — 

" '  O  Lord,  by  virtue  of  the  boons  they  have  received,  the  three 
sons  of  Sukesha,  like  unto  three  fires,  penetrated  into  our  abode 
and  took  possession  of  it.  Lanka  is  the  name  of  that  inaccessible 
citadel  built  on  the  summit  of  the  Mount  Trikuta ;  it  is  there 
that  these  rangers  of  the  night,  our  persecutors,  have  established 
themselves.  Come  to  our  aid  and  destroy  them,  O  Slayer  of 
Madhu  !  We  take  refuge  in  Thee,  be  our  deliverer,  O  Lord  of 
the  Gods!  Do  Thou  offer  up  their  lotus-like  faces,  severed  by  Thy 
discus,  to  Yama.  In  time  of  peril,  none  but  Thee  canst  give  us 
shelter,  O  Lord.  As  the  sun  dispels  the  mist,  so  do  Thou  dispel 
our  terror  in  regard  to  these  Rakshasas,  who,  with  their  adherents 
take  delight  in  warfare  ! ' 

"  When  the  Gods  had  spoken  thus,  the  Lord  of  Lords,  Janar- 
dana,  who  strikes  terror  in  the  hearts  of  his  foes,  re-assured 
them,  saying : — 

" '  The  Rakshasa  Sukesha,  who,  on  account  of  the  boons

received  from  Ishana,  is  intoxicated  with  pride,  is  known  to  me 
and  his  sons  also,  the  eldest  of  whom  is  Malyavan.  Those 
Rakshasas,  the  vilest  of  all,  exceed  all  limits  and  I  shall  extermin- 
ate them  in  my  wrath,  O  Ye  Gods,  have  no  fear ! ' 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  the  mighty  Janardana,  Vishnu,  each  of 
the  Gods  returned  to  his  abode,  chanting  His  praises. 

"  Learning  of  the  intervention  of  the  Gods,  that  ranger  of  the 
night  Malyavan,  said  to  his  two  valiant  brothers  : — 

"  '  The  Immortals  and  the  Rishis  have  unitedly  sought  out 
Shankara  in  order  to  bring  about  our  destruction  and  addressed 
Him  thus : — 

"  O  Lord,  the  offspring  of  Sukesha,  intoxicated  with  pride,  by 
the  power  they  received  from  those  boons  torment  us  without 
respite.  Harassed  by  these  Rakshasas,  it  is  impossible  for  us,  O 
Frajapati,  to  remain  in  our  retreats  for  fear  of  those  wicked  ones  ; 
do  Thou  defend  us  and  subdue  them,  O  Three-eyed  God,  and, 
with  Thy  word  of  power  '  Hum  ',  burn  them  up,  O  Supreme 
Consumer. 

"'Thus  did  the  Gods  speak  and  the  Slayer  of  Andaka,  shaking 
his  head  and  hands,  answered  them  saying : — 

"  '  It  is  impossible  for  me  to  destroy  the  celestial  children  of 
Sukesha  in  the  open  field  but  I  will  tell  you  the  means  whereby 
they  may  be  slain.  Let  the  God  who  bears  the  Mace  and  Discus 
in  His  hands,  who  is  clad  in  yellow,  Janardana,  Hari,  Narayana, 
the  Lord  of  Shri,  be  your  refuge ! ' 

"  *  Having  received  this  counsel  from  Hara  and  taken  leave  of 
that  enemy  of  Kama,  the  Gods  went  to  Narayana's  abode  and 
related  all  to  Him.  Then  Narayana  said  to  the  Gods,  who  had 
India  at  their  head  : — 

"  *  I  shall  slay  all  your  enemies,  O  Ye  Gods,  fear  not !  * 

"  *  O  Foremost  of  the  Rakshasas,  Hari  promised  those  Gods, 
who  were  filled  with  terror,  that  He  would  destroy  us.  There- 
fore do  what  you  think  fit.  Narayana  has  slain  Hiranyakashipu 
and  other  foes  of  the  Gods ;  Namuchi,  Kalanemi,  Samrhada 
that  foremost  of  warriors,  and  Radheya,Bahumayin,the  virtuous 
Lokapala  and  Yamala,  Arjuna,  Hardikya,  Shumbha,  Nishumbha, 
all  those  Asuras  and  Danavas,  full  of  courage  and  strength,  said 
to  be  invincible  in  the  field,  who  had  offered  hundreds  of 
sacrifices,  were  versed  in  magic  and  skilled  in  the  use  of  weapons 

ac  389 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  who  were  all  a  source  of  terror  to  their  foes.  Knowing  this, 
it  behoveth  us  to  unite  in  order  to  slay  the  wicked  Narayana 
who  wishes  to  exterminate  us/ 

"  Hearing  Malyavan,  their  elder  brother  speak  thus,  Sumali  and 
Mali  answered  him  as  the  Twin  Ashwins  address  Vasava, 
saying: — 

"  *  We  have  studied  the  Veda,  made  charitable  gifts,  offered 
sacrifices,  safe-guarded  our  sovereignty,  obtained  the  boon  of 
longevity  and  freedom  from  disease  and  have  established 
righteousness.  Plunging  our  weapons  into  the  bottomless  ocean 
of  the  Gods,  we  have  explored  it ;  we  have  overcome  our  enemies 
though  their  valour  was  unequalled ;  nay,  we  have  nothing  to 
fear  from  Mrityu,  Narayana,  Rudra,  Shakra  and  Yama,  all 
hesitate  to  oppose  us !  Since  we  have  come  together,  let  us 
assist  each  other  mutually  and  exterminate  the  Gods,  whose 
perfidy  has  been  revealed  to  us.' 

"  Hiving  taken  counsel  together  thus,  those  huge-bodied  and 
valiant  Nairritas  hurled  themselves  into  the  fray,  like  unto 
Jambha  and  Vritra  of  yore. 

"  0  Rama,  thus  resolved,  summoning  up  all  their  strength,  they 
set  out  to  fight,  mounted  on  their  chariots,  elephants  and  horses 
that  resembled  elephants,  mules,  bulls,  buffalo,  porpoises, 
serpents,  whales,  turtle,  fish,  and  birds  resembling  Garuda,  also 
on  lions,  tigers,  boars,  deer  and  Yaks. 

"  Intoxicated  with  pride,  all  those  Rakshasas  marched  out  of 
Lanka,  and  those  enemies  of  the  Gods  determined  to  lay  siege  to 
Devaloka.  Perceiving  the  destruction  of  Lanka  to  be  at  hand, 
all  the  beings  who  inhabited  it,  recognizing  the  peril  in  which 
they  stood,  became  wholly  dispirited,  whilst  the  Rakshasas, 
borne  in  marvellous  chariots  hastened  towards  Devaloka  in 
hundreds  and  thousands,  but  the  Gods  avoided  the  path  they 
had  taken. 

"  Thereupon,  at  Kala's  command,  terrible  portents  appeared 
on  earth  and  in  the  skies,  foretelling  the  death  of  the  Rakshasa 
leaders.  From  the  clouds  a  torrent  of  hot  blood  and  bones  fell, 
the  seas  over-passed  their  bornes  and  the  mountains  shook, 
jackals  of  formidable  aspect  howled  lugubriously,  emitting 
hoarse  laughter  that  resembled  the  rumble  of  clouds.  Groups 
of  phantoms  passed  by  in  succession,  and  flocks  of  vultures, 
390 


UTTARA    KANDA 

vomiting  flames,  hovered  like  fate  over  the  Chief  of  the  Rak- 
shasas.  Red-footed  pigeons  and  crows  fled  in  all  directions, 
ravens  croaked  and  two  footed  cats  were  seen. 

"  Disregarding  these  omens,  the  Rakshasas,  proud  of  their 
strength,  continued  to  advance  without  halting,  caught  in  the 
noose  of  death.  Malyavan,  Sumali  and  Mali  of  immense  power, 
preceded  the  Rakshasas  like  unto  naming  braziers  ;  Malyavan, 
who  resembled  Mount  Malyavan,  was  escorted  by  all  the  rangers 
of  the  night,  as  the  Gods  by  Dhatar.  That  army  of  the  foremost 
of  the  Rakshasas,  thundering  like  massed  clouds,  eager  for 
victory,  advanced  towards  Devaloka  under  Mali's  leadership 

"  Then  the  Lord  Narayana,  learning  thereof  from  a  messenger 
of  the  Gods,  resolved  to  enter  into  combat  with  them.  Making 
ready  His  arms  and  quivers,  He  mounted  Vainateya  and,  having 
put  on  His  celestial  armour  which  shone  like  a  thousand  suns,  He 
strapped  on  two  dazzling  quivers  full  of  arrows.  Buckling  on 
His  stainless  sword,  that  God,  Whose  eyes  resembled  lotuses, 
furnished  with  His  conch,  discus,  mace,  sword,  excellent  weapons 
and  His  bow,1  fully  equipped,  mounted  the  son  of  Vinata,2  who 
was  as  high  as  a  hill,  and  thereafter  the  Lord  set  out  in  all  haste 
to  slay  the  Rakshasas. 

"  On  the  back  of  Suparna,  the  dark-hued  Hari,  clad  in  yellow, 
resembled  a  cloud  transpierced  with  lightning  on  the  peak  of  a 
golden  mountain.  As  He  left,  with  His  discus,  sword,  bow, 
spear  and  His  conch  in  His  hands,  Siddhas,  Devarisbis,  Great 
Serpents,  Gandharvas  and  Yakshas  hymned  the  praises  of  the 
renowned  enemy  of  the  Asura  Host. 

"  With  the  blast  of  His  wings,  Suparna  struck  at  the  Hostof  the 
Rakshasas,  bringing  down  their  standards  and  dispersing  their 
weapons  so  that  they  reeled  like  the  dark  summit  of  a  mountain 
whose  crags  are  crumbling  away. 

"  With  their  excellent  shafts  however,  soiled  with  flesh  and 
blood,  like  unto  the  fires  of  doom  at  the  end  of  the  world  cycle, 
which  they  loosed  in  thousands,  those  rangers  of  the  night 
covered  and  pierced  Madhava.

CHAPTER    7 

The  Combat  between  Vishnu  and  the  Rakshasas 

"  In  the  midst  of  rumblings,  the  clouds  in  the  form  of  Rakshasas 
poured  down  a  shower  of  weapons  on  the  Peak  Narayana,  as 
with  their  torrents  they  shroud  a  mountain,  and  the  dark  and 
immaculate  Vishnu,  surrounded  by  those  swarthy  and  powerful 
rangers  of  the  night,  resembled  Mount  Anjana  under  rain.  As 
locusts  in  a  rice  field  or  gnats  in  a  flame,  as  flies  in  a  pot  of  honey, 
as  monsters  in  the  deep,  so  did  the  arrows,  keen  as  diamonds, 
swift  as  the  wind  or  thought,  which  the  Rakshasas  loosed  on 
Hari,  piercing  him,  disappear  as  the  worlds  vanish  at  the  time  of 
universal  destruction. 

"  Warriors  in  chariots  or  seated  on  the  heads  of  elephants, 
soldiers  on  horseback,  infantry  stationed  in  the  sky,  leaders  of 
the  Rakshasas  resembling  mountains,  with  their  shafts,  spears, 
swords  and  darts,  caused  Hari  to  hold  His  breath,  like  unto  the 
Twice-born  when  practising  Pranayama.1 

"  Like  an  ocean  where  fishes  play,  that  invincible  God,  under 
the  countless  blows  of  those  rangers  of  the  night,  drew  His  bow 
and  loosed  His  shafts  on  them ;  then  Vishnu  with  extreme 
force,  like  unto  lightning,  swift  as  thought,  riddled  them  with 
His  penetrating  weapons  and  spears  by  hundreds  and  thousands. 
Having  dispersed  them  under  a  load  of  arrows  as  the  wind  a 
downpour,  the  Supreme  Purusha  blew  His  great  Conch  Pan- 
chajaya,  and  that  king  of  conches,  born  of  the  waters,  into  which 
Hari  blew  with  all  His  strength,  re-echoed  in  such  fearful  wise 
that  it  shook  the  Three  Worlds  as  it  were.  The  sound  of  that 
king  of  conches  struck  terror  into  the  Rakshasas,  as  the  King  of 
Beasts  in  the  forest  terrorizes  the  elephants  intoxicated  with 
ichor.  At  the  sound  of  the  conch,  the  horses  were  no  longer  able 
to  stand  erect,  the  frenzy  of  the  elephants  was  subdued,  whilst 
the  warriors  fell  from  their  cars  bereft  of  strength. 

"  Loosed  from  His  bow,  Vishnu's  arrows,  possessed  of  plumed 

1  The  science  of  breath  control. 

39* 


UTTARA    KANDA 

halts,  having  rent  the  Rakshasas,  penetrated  into  the  earth. 
Pierced  by  those  darts,  which  the  hand  of  Narayana  loosed  in 
the  fight,  the  Rakshasas  fell  on  the  earth  like  crags  struck  by 
lightning,  their  powerful  limbs  torn  by  Vishnu's  discus,  the 
blood  flowing  in  torrents,  as  from  mountains  secreting  gold. 
The  sound  of  that  king  of  conches,  the  twanging  of  the  bow- 
string and  the  voice  of  Vishnu  stifled  the  cries  of  the  Rakshasas. 

"  Then  Hari  severed  their  trembling  necks,  their  darts,  banners, 
bows,  chariots,  pennants  and  quivers.  As  the  rays  fall  from  the 
sun,  as  masses  of  water  spout  forth  from  the  sea,  as  mighty 
tuskers  rush  down  the  mountain  side,  as  torrents  of  rain  fall 
from  a  cloud,  so  did  the  darts  and  arrows  discharged  by  Nara- 
yana from  His  bow,  fall  in  hundreds  and  thousands.  As  a  lion 
before  a  Sharabha,  as  an  elephant  before  a  lion,  as  a  tiger  before 
an  elephant,  as  a  panther  before  a  tiger,  as  a  dog  before  a  panther, 
as  a  cat  before  a  dog,  as  a  snake  before  a  cat,  as  mice  before  a 
snake,  so  did  the  Rakshasas  flee  before  the  mighty  Vishnu. 
Some  escaped,  others  fell  in  their  flight  and  the  rest  lay  stretched 
on  the  earth.  Whilst  slaying  his  foes  in  their  thousands,  the 
Destroyer  of  Madhu  filled  the  conch  with  his  breath,  as  Indra 
the  clouds  with  water. 

"  Put  to  flight  by  Narayana's  shafts,  terrified  by  the  sound  of  the 
conch,  the  army  of  the  Rakshasas,  their  ranks  broken,  fled  in 
the  direction  of  Lanka. 

"  Seeing  his  troops  routed,  decimated  by  Narayana's  arrows, 
Sumali  covered  Hari  with  a  hail  of  darts  on  the  battlefield,  as  the 
fog  obscures  the  sun,  whereupon  the  valiant  Rakshasas  plucked 
up  courage.  Then  Sumali,  proud  of  his  strength,  rallying  his 
forces,  hurled  himself  forward  with  a  great  shout.  Shaking  his 
earrings  as  an  elephant  his  trunk,  that  night-ranger,  in  his  joy, 
raised  a  great  clamour  like  unto  a  cloud  pierced  by  lightning  and, 
while  Sumali  cried  out  thus,  Hari  cut  off  the  head  of  his  charioteer 
with  its  dazzling  earrings,  and  the  steeds  of  that  Rakshasa 
swerved,  bearing  away  Sumali,  the  leader  of  the  Titans,  as  those 
other  steeds,  the  senses,  when  uncontrolled,  bear  away  man's 
judgment. 

"Thereafter  while  Sumali  was  being  borne  away  by  the  horses 
of  his  chariot,  Mali,  alert,  armed  with  his  bow,  rushed  on  the 
mighty  Vishnu  who,  on  his  vehicle,  had  thrown  himself  into  the 
393 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

fray ;  and  he  let  fly  his  arrows  decorated  with  gold  from  his 
bow,  which  fell  on  Hari  piercing  him,  as  birds  penetrate  into 
the  Krauncha  Mountain.  Assailed  by  the  shafts,  which  Mali 
loosed  in  their  thousands  in  the  fight,  Vishnu  remained  as 
undisturbed  as  one  in  full  control  of  his  senses  in  the  face  of 
adversity. 

"  Twanging  His  bow-string,  Bhagawat,  the  Author  of  all  beings, 
still  bearing  bis  sword  and  mace,  discharged  a  hail  of  arrows  on 
Mali,  like  unto  thunder  and  lightning,  penetrating  his  body,  and 
those  shafts  drank  his  blood  as  serpents  a  pleasing  draught. 

"  In  the  confusion  into  which  he  had  thrown  Mali,  the  God  who 
bears  the  conch,  discus  and  mace,  struck  off  his  diadem  and 
brought  down  bis  banner,  his  bow  and  his  steeds.  Deprived  of 
bis  chariot,  that  most  powerful  ranger  of  the  night  seized  hold 
of  his  mace  and,  with  this  weapon  in  his  hand,  like  a  lion  from 
a  mountain  height,  hurled  himself  on  the  King  of  the  Birds1  as 
Antaka  on  Ishana,  striking  him  on  the  forehead,  as  Indra  strikes 
a  mountain  with  his  thunderbolt. 

"  On  receiving  that  violent  blow  dealt  by  Mali,  Garuda,  dis- 
tracted with  pain,  carried  the  God  away  from  the  fight,  and 
Vishnu,  having  turned  away  through  this  act  of  Mali's  and 
Garuda's,  a  great  clamour  arose  from  the  Rakshasas  shouting  in 
triumph. 

"  Hearing  the  Rakshasas  shout  thus,  the  younger  brother  of 
Harihaya,the  blessed  Hari,  was  incensed  with  that  King  of  Birds 
who  served  as  his  mount  and,  with  the  intention  of  slaying  Mali, 
though  his  back  was  turned,  He  loosed  His  discus  that  was  as 
bright  as  the  solar  orb,  whose  radiance  illumines  the  heavens. 
Like  unto  Kala's  wheel,2  the  discus  fell  on  Mali's  head  and  that 
terrible  head  of  that  leader  of  the  Rakshasas,  thus  severed,  rolled 
down  amidst  torrents  of  blood,  as  formerly  that  of  Rahu. 

"  At  that  instant,  the  Gods,  transported  with  joy,  emitted  roars 
like  unto  lions,  crying  with  all  their  strength, '  Victory  to  Thee, 

0  Lord !  * 

"  Beholding  Mali  slain,  Sumali  and  Malyavan,  in  burning  grief, 
took  refuge  in  Lanka  with  their  forces.    Meanwhile  Garuda

having  recovered,  retraced  his  steps  and,  in  fury,  dispersed  the 
Rakshasas  with  the  blast  of  his  wings.  Their  lotus  faces  cut  with 
the  discus,  their  breasts  torn  by  the  mace,  their  necks  severed  by 
the  ploughshare,  their  foreheads  split  open  by  pikes,  some 
pierced  by  the  sword,  some  slain  by  arrows,  those  Rakshasas 
began  to  fall  from  the  skies  into  the  waters  of  the  sea. 

"  Narayana,  like  unto  a  luminous  cloud,  with  his  excellent 
shafts  loosed  from  His  bow,  as  so  many  lightning  strokes,  exter- 
minated those  rangers  of  the  night  with  their  hair  dishevelled 
and  streaming  in  the  wind.  Their  parasols  broken,  their  rich 
apparel  torn  by  the  shafts,  their  entrails  ripped  open,  their  eyes 
wide  with  fear,  those  warriors,  throwing  away  their  arms,  fell 
into  a  frenzy  of  terror.  Resembling  elephants  attacked  by  a 
lion,  those  night-rangers  with  their  mounts  emitted  cries  whilst 
fleeing  from  that  Primeval  Lion,1  who  pursued  them. 

"  Overwhelmed  by  a  rain  of  darts  from  Hari,  they  threw  away 
their  weapons,  and  those  rangers  of  the  night  resembled  sombre 
clouds  which  the  wind  drives  before  it.  Their  heads  severed^by 
the  discus,  their  limbs  crushed  with  blows  from  the  mace,  cut 
in  two  by  strokes  of  the  sword,  those  foremost  of  the  night- 
rangers,  resembling  sable  clouds,  crumbled  like  rocks  and  they 
stumbled  and  fell  on  the  earth  which  they  covered  completely 
like  dark  mountains  which  have  been  shattered. 


CHAPTER     8 

The  Combat  between  Vishnu  and  Malyavan 

"  When  the  army  that  followed  him  was  destroyed  by 
Padmanabha,3  Malyavan  halted  in  his  flight,  as  the  ocean  when  it 
reaches  the  shore.  His  eyes  red  with  anger,  his  head  trembling,  that 
ranger  of  the  night  said  to  Padmanabha,  the  Supreme  Purusha  :- 
"  'O  Narayana,  Thou  art  ignorant  of  the  ancient  tradition  of 
warriors,  since  Thou,  as  if  a  stranger  to  their  caste,  dost  slay 

1  Primeval  Lion — Referring  to  Vishnu's  incarnation  as  Nrsingha,  half  man, 

half  lion. 
*  Padmanabha — The  Lotus-navelled  One.

those  who,  in  their  terror,  have  retreated  in  the  fight.  That 
assassin  who  commits  the  sin  of  slaying  a  foe  who  has  turned  his 
back  on  him,  O  Chief  of  the  Gods,  does  not  attain  heaven,  as  do 
the  virtuous  on  leaving  this  world.  Assuredly  if  Thou  dost 
desire  to  enter  into  combat,  Thou  Who  art  armed  with  conch, 
discus  and  mace,  here  I  stand !  Manifest  Thy  prowess  that  I 
may  witness  it ! ' 

"  Seeing  Malyavan  standing  motionless,  like  unto  the  mountain 
of  that  name,  the  younger  brother  of  the  King  of  the  Gods,  in 
his  valour,  answered  the  foremost  of  the  Rakshasas,  saying : — 

" '  I  have  vowed  to  the  Gods  that  I  will  deliver  them  from  the 
terror  thou  hast  inspired,  by  slaying  thee,  I  shall  honour  that 
pledge.  The  welfare  of  the  Gods  is  dearer  to  me  than  life 
itself;  therefore  I  shall  destroy  you  all ;  now  descend  into  the 
lowest  hell ! ' 

"  Thus  did  the  Lord  of  Lords  speak,  He  Whose  eyes  resembled 
crimson  lotuses  and,  filled  with  fury,  the  Rakshasa,  with  his 
spear,  cut  open  his  breast.  Wielded  by  Malyavan's  arm,  that 
weapon  emitting  the  sound  of  a  bell,  glittered  in  the  breast  of 
Hari  like  lightning  athwart  a  cloud.  Thereafter,  He  Who  is 
dear  to  the  God  Who  bears  the  Spear  2  drawing  out  that  lance, 
hurled  it  at  Malyavan  and,  as  formerly  Skanda  loosed  it,  that 
weapon,  flying  from  the  hand  of  Govinda,  rushed  on  the 
Rakshasa  like  unto  a  great  meteor  striking  the  Anjana  Mountain, 
and  it  fell  on  his  mighty  chest,  that  was  adorned  with  innumer- 
able diamonds,  as  lightning  strikes  a  rocky  summit.  That  blow 
cut  his  mail  asunder  and  his  eyes  were  veiled  but,  recovering 
consciousness,  he  stood  erect  once  more,  like  unto  an  im- 
moveable rock.  Armed  with  an  iron  club  with  innumerable 
spikes,  he  struck  the  God  violently  in  the  centre  of  the  breast 
and,  in  his  martial  ardour,  having  wounded  the  younger  brother 
of  Vasava  with  his  fist,  that  ranger  of  the  night  retreated  a  bow's 
length.  At  that  moment,  the  cry  *  Excellent,  Excellent '  arose 
in  the  sky. 

"  Thereafter  the  Rakshasa  attacked  Garuda,  and  Vainateya 
incensed,  drove  him  off  with  the  blast  of  his  wings  as  a  violent 
tempest  disperses  a  heap  of  withered  leaves.

"  Seeing  his  elder  brother  driven  back  by  the  blast  of  GarudVs 
wings,  Sumali,  overcome  with  confusion,  with  his  troops  fled  in 
the  direction  of  Lanka.  And  thrust  back  by  the  violence  of  the 
wind  produced  by  those  wings,  Malyavan  also,  joined  by  his 
forces,  fled  to  Lanka  covered  with  shame. 

"  O  Lotus-eyed  Prince,  the  Rakshasas  having  been  repeatedly 
defeated  in  the  battle  by  Hari  and  having  lost  the  most  valiant  of 
their  leaders,  in  their  inability  to  withstand  Vishnu,  Who  was 
destroying  them,  abandoned  Lanka  and  went  to  dwell  in  Patala 
with  their  consorts.  O  Prince  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  those 
Rakshasas,  renowned  for  their  strength  and  who  were  the  issue 
of  the  Salakatankata  Race,  remained  under  the  leadership  of 
Sumali.  It  was  Thou  Who  didst  destroy  those  warriors  of  the 
family  of  Poulastya  named  Sumali,  Malyavan,  Mali  and  their 
companions,  who  were  all  exceedingly  resourceful  and  more 
powerful  than  Ravana.  None  other  could  have  subdued  the 
enemies  of  the  Gods  or  have  weeded  out  those  thorns  in  the  side 
of  the  Celestials,  save  Narayana,  the  God  Who  bears  the  conch, 
discus  and  mace.  Thou  art  that  Four-armed  God,  Narayana, 
eternal,  invincible  and  immutable,  Who  came  to  exterminate  the 
Rakshasas.  Thou  art  the  Father  of  all  Beings,  who,  whenever 
righteousness  declines  and  for  love  of  those  who  take  refuge  in 
Thee,  dost  appear  to  wipe  out  evil-doers. 

"  O  Lord  of  Men,  I  have  related  in  detail  all  that  concerns  the 
origin  of  the  Rakshasas.  Learn  further,  O  Prince  of  the  Raghus, 
of  the  immeasurable  power  of  Ravana  and  his  sons. 

"  For  a  long  time,  Sumali  wandered  about  the  nether  regions, 
tormented  by  the  fear  of  Vishnu,  whilst  the  mighty  God  of 
Wealth,  surrounded  by  his  sons  and  grandsons,  sojourned  in

The  Birth  of  Dashagriva  and  fas  Brothers 

"  After  a  time,  that  Rakshasa,  named  Sumali,  emerged  from  the 
nether  regions  to  range  the  world  of  men.  With  his  earrings  of 
pure  gold,  he,  tike  unto  a  dark  cloud,  took  with  him  a  young 
girl  who  resembled  Shri  without  her  lotus  and,  as  that  Rakshasa 
397 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

wandered  about  the  earth,  he  beheld  the  Lord  of  Wealth,  who 
in  his  Chariot  Pushpaka  was  going  to  visit  his  sire.  Beholding 
that  son  of  Poulastya,  that  lord  who  was  as  radiant  as  a  God, 
advancing  towards  him  like  unto  fire,  he,  amazed,  returned  to 
Rasatala  from  the  world  of  men. 

"  Thereafter  that  exceedingly  intelligent  Rakshasa  reflected 
'  Which  is  the  best  way  of  increasing  our  power  ?  *  Thus  did 
the  foremost  of  the  Raksbasas,  who  was  like  unto  a  dark  cloud 
and  was  wearing  golden  earrings,  reflect  within  himself  and, 
having  considered  awhile,  that  extremely  sagacious  Rakshasa 
said  to  his  daughter  Kaikasi,  for  such  was  her  name : — 

" '  My  Daughter,  it  is  time  for  thee  to  wed ;  thy  youth  is 
slipping  away  and,  afraid  of  being  refused,  those  who  are  in  love 
with  thee  do  not  pay  their  suit.  Striving  to  fulfil  our  duty,  we 
seek  only  thine  advantage.  Assuredly,  thou  art  endowed  with 
every  good  attribute  and  resemblest  Shri  in  person,  O  Dear 
Child  1  A  young  daughter  is  a  source  of  anxiety  to  her  father 
who  is  concerned  for  her  honour,  nor  does  he  know  whom  she 
will  wed.  O  Beloved  Child,  the  mother's  family,  the  father's 
family  and  the  one  into  which  she  is  received  are  all  three 
involved  in  this  anxiety.  Do  thou  therefore  seek  out  that  blessed 
ascetic,  the  foremost  of  Poulastya's  offspring  and  choose  Vish- 
ravas,  the  descendant  of  Poulastya,  O  My  Daughter.  Assuredly 
thou  wilt  beget  sons  equal  to  that  Lord  of  Wealth,  who,  in  his 
splendour,  rivals  the  sun.' 

"  At  these  words,  in  filial  obedience,  that  young  girl  went  to 
seek  out  Vishravas  where  he  was  undergoing  penance.  At  that 
time,  O  Rama,  that  Twice-born,  the  issue  of  Poulastya  was 
engaged  in  the  Fire  Sacrifice  and  himself  appeared  like  unto  a 
fourth  fire.  Heedless  of  the  late  hour  and,  in  obedience  to  her 
sire,  she  presented  herself  before  the  ascetic  and,  halting  there 
with  her  eyes  cast  down,  fixed  on  her  feet,  she  scratched  the 
earth  from  time  to  time  with  her  toe. 

"  Beholding  that  lovely  girl,  whose  face  resembled  the  full 
moon  and  who  shone  in  her  own  radiance,  that  Muni  of  exalted 
lineage,  enquired  of  her  saying : — 

" '  O  Fortunate  One,  whose  daughter  art  thou  ?  From  whence 
dost  thou  come  and  for  what  reason  or  with  what  motive? 
Answer  me  truthfully,  O  Beautiful  One  ? ' 
398 


UTTARA    KANDA 

"  Thus  questioned,  the  young  girl  with  joined  palms,  answered: 

*  By  thine  own  powers,  O  Muni,  thou  must  be  conversant 
with  mine  intentions !  Learn  only,  O  Brahmarisni,  that  it  is  by 
the  command  of  my  sire  that  I  have  come,  and  Kaikasi  is  my 
name.  The  rest  must  be  known  to  thee.*  Thereafter  the  Muni, 
reflecting  awhile,  uttered  these  words  : — 

" '  I  know  well,  O  Fortunate  One,  what  brings  thee  here,  thou 
art  desirous  of  having  sons  by  me,  thou  whose  gait  is  like  unto 
an  intoxicated  elephant !  But,  having  presented  thyself  at  this 
hour,1  hear  me,  O  Fortunate  One,  thou  shalt  bring  forth  off- 
spring of  a  dark  aspect  delighting  in  the  companionship  of  doers 
of  evil  deeds.  O  Lady  of  Lovely  Form,  thou  shalt  beget 
Rakshasas  of  cruel  exploits.' 

"At  these  words,  Kaikasi  prostrated  herself,  saying  : — 

"  *  O  Blessed  One  who  recitest  the  Veda,  I  do  not  desire  such 
sons  whose  nature  is  depraved,  from  thee,  be  gracious  unto  me  !  * 

"  Thus  besought  by  that  youthful  maiden,  Vishravas,  foremost 
among  Munis,  like  unto  the  moon  in  the  presence  of  Rohini, 
added  : — 

" '  O  Lady  of  Lovely  Face,  the  son  thou  shalt  bring  forth  last 
will  be  like  unto  me,  assuredly  he  will  be  virtuous.' 

"  Thus  did  he  speak  to  that  young  girl,  O  Rama,  and  after  some 
time  she  gave  birth  to  a  hideous  child  with  the  face  of  a  demon, 
exceedingly  dark ;  and  he  had  ten  necks  and  great  teeth  and 
resembled  a  heap  of  collyrium ;  his  lips  were  of  the  hueof  copper, 
he  had  twenty  arms  and  a  vast  mouth  and  his  hair  was  fiery  red. 
At  his  birth,  jackals  and  other  wild  beasts  with  flaming  jaws 
circled  from  left  to  right.  The  God  Parjanya  let  loose  a  rain  of 
blood  whilst  clouds  emitted  harsh  sounds ;  the  sun  ceased  to 
shine,  fierce  winds  blew  and  the  unchanging  ocean,  Lord  of  the 
Rivers,  was  agitated. 

' '  His  father,  who  resembled  the  Grandsire  of  the  World,  there- 
upon conferred  a  name  upon  him  and  said  : —  *  This  child  with 
ten  necks  shall  be  called  Dashagriva.* 

"  After  him  the  mighty  Kumbhakarna  was  born,  that  giant  who 
was  unequalled  on  earth,  and  a  daughter  of  hideous  aspect, 
named  Shurpanakha,  while  Kaikasi's  last  child  was  named 
Bibishana. 

1  That  is  at  dusk,  interrupting  the  Evening  Devotions,  which  was  inauspicious. 
399 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

*'  When  this  great  being  was  born,  a  rain  of  flowers  fell  and,  in 
the  heavens,  celestial  gongs  resounded  whilst  an  aerial  voice 
cried,  '  Excellent ",  "  Excellent '. 

"  Thereafter  Kumbhakarna  and  Dashagriva  throve  in  that  vast 
forest  and  each  was  exceedingly  powerful  and  they  were  scourgers 
of  the  worlds.  The  insensate  Kumbhakarna  ranged  the  Three 
Worlds  devouring  the  great  Rishis  who  were  fixed  in  their  duty, 
and  yet  he  remained  unsatisfied. 

"  As  for  the  virtuous  Bibishana,  ever  vowed  to  righteousness, 
the  study  of  the  Veda  being  his  chief  nourishment,  he  lived  as 
the  subduer  of  his  senses. 

"  After  a  time  Vaishravana,  the  Lord  of  Wealth,  went  to  visit 
his  sire  in  his  Chariot  Pushpaka  and,  seeing  him  flaming  with 
effulgence,  the  Rakshasi  sought  out  Dashagriva  and  said  to 
him: — 

"  *  My  Son,  behold  Vaishravana,  thy  brother,  blazing  with 
glory  and  behold  thy  state,  who  art  of  the  same  family,  O 
Dashagriva.  Thou  who  art  of  immeasurable  might,  strive  to  be 
like  Vaishravana  himself.' 

"  Hearing  his  mother's  words,  the  arrogant  Dashagriva  experi- 
enced a  wave  of  overpowering  bitterness,  whereupon  he  formu- 
lated this  vow. 

"  *  I  swear  to  thee  in  truth  that  I  shall  become  my  brother's 
equal  if  not  his  superior  in  power  ;  banish  any  fears  that  may  have 
entered  thine  heart !  ' 

"  Thereafter,  in  his  spleen,  Dashagriva,  accompanied  by  his 
younger  brother,1  began  to  undertake  an  exceedingly  difficult 
task,  undergoing  a  rigid  penance. 

(He  thought)  '  I  shall  accomplish  mine  end  by  asceticism ' 
and  having  thus  resolved,  he  went  to  the  lovely  hermitage  of 
Gokarna  in  order  to  purify  his  soul.  There  that  Rakshasa  with 
his  younger  brother  performed  unsurpassed  austerities.  Such 
were  his  mortifications  that  he  gratified  the  Lord,  the  Grandsire 
of  the  World,  who,  in  his  satisfaction,  granted  him  those  boons 
that  would  assure  him  of  victory.  "

CHAPTER    10 

Concerning  the  Penances  practised  by  Dashagriva  and  fas  Brother 

Then  Rama  enquired  of  the  Muni  : — "  How  did  those  highly 
powerful  brothers  practice  penance,  O  Brahmana,  and  of  what 
nature  was  it  ?  " 

Then  Agastya  of  tranquil  mind  answered  Rama  and  said  : — 

"Various  were  the  pious  observances  of  each  of  them; 
Kumbhakarna  too,  putting  forth  all  his  strength,  constantly 
pursued  the  path  of  duty.  In  the  heat  of  summer  he  stood 
amidst  five  fires  and,  in  the  rainy  season,  he  took  up  the  Vira 
posture,1  whilst  in  the  winter  season  he  remained  plunged  in 
water. 

"  Thus  two  thousand  years  passed  during  which  he  applied 
himself  to  piety  and  remained  on  the  righteous  path. 

"  On  his  side,  Bibishana,  who  was  virtue  itself,  intent  on  duty 
and  of  pure  soul,  stood  on  one  leg  for  five  thousand  years.  This 
penance  accomplished,  troops  of  Apsaras  danced  and  a  rain  of 
flowers  fell,  whilst  the  Gods  hymned  his  praises.  During  another 
five  thousand  years,  he  stood  facing  the  sun,  bis  head  and  arms 
raised,  his  mind  fixed  in  contemplation  of  the  Veda.  In  this 
wise,  Bibishana,  like  an  inhabitant  of  heaven  in  the  Nandana 
Gardens,  dwelt  for  ten  thousand  years.  And  Dashagriva 
deprived  himself  of  nourishment  for  the  same  period  and  every 
thousand  years  sacrificed  one  of  his  heads  to  the  God  of  Fire. 
Thus  nine  thousand  years  passed  and  nine  of  bis  heads  had  been 
sacrificed  to  Fire;  when  ten  thousand  years  had  gone  by, 
Dashagriva  prepared  to  sever  his  tenth  head  when  the  Grandsire 
of  the  World  appeared,  and  He,  with  the  Gods,  highly  gratified, 
presented  Himself  before  Ravana  and  said  to  hi"> : — 

"'lam  pleased  with  thee,  what  boon  shall  I  confer  on  thee 
this  day  ?  Thou  shalt  not  have  undergone  these  austerities  in 
vain.  O  Thou  who  art  conversant  with  dharma,  speedily  choose 
what  boon  will  most  please  thee ;  thou  hast  found  favour  with 
me,  O  Dashagriva  1 ' 

1  Vira  posture — The  posture  which  is  favourable  to  the  regulation  of  breath.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"Thereupon  Dashagriva,  delighted,  bowing  down  to  that 
God,  answered  in  a  voice  trembling  with  joy : — 

"  '  O  Bhagawat,  for  living  beings  there  exists  no  fear  like  that 
of  death ;  there  is  no  foe  comparable  to  Mrityu,  therefore  I 
choose  immortality !  * 

"  Thus  spoke  Dashagriva  and  Brahma  answered  him  saying  :- 

"  *  It  is  not  possible  to  grant  thee  immortality,  choose  some 
other  boon ! ' 

"  At  these  words  of  Brahma,  the  Creator  of  the  World,  O  Rama, 
Dashagriva  replied  with  joined  palms : — 

*'*  May  I  not  be  slain  by  Suparnas,  Nagas,  Yakshas,  Dairy  as 
Danavas,  Rakshasas  nor  by  the  Gods,  O  Eternal  One,  O  Lord  of 
Beings.  I  do  not  fear  other  creatures,  who,  with  men,  I  look  upon 
as  mere  straws,  O  Thou  who  art  adored  by  the  Celestials.' 

"  Thus  spoke  the  Rakshasa  Dasaratha,  and  the  Lord,  the  Grand- 
sire  of  the  Worlds,  who  was  accompanied  by  the  Gods,  said  to 
him: — 

"  *  It  shall  be  as  thou  desirest,  O  Foremost  of  the  Rakshasas !  * 
Then,  having  answered  Dashagriva  thus,  O  Rama,  the  Grand- 
sire  added : — 

" '  Hear  what  great  favour  I  shall  grant  thee  further  in  my 
satisfaction.  The  heads  that  formerly  were  sacrificed  by  thee 
into  the  fire,  O  Irreproachable  One,  will  now  grow  again  as 
they  were  before  and,  O  Rakshasa,  I  will  finally  confer  another 
boon  on  thee  that  is  hard  to  obtain,  O  My  Friend,  thou  shall  be 
able  to  assume  any  form  thou  desirest  at  will.' 

"  As  soon  as  the  Grandsire  had  spoken  thus,  the  heads  of  the 
Rakshasa  Dashagriva,  that  had  been  consumed  by  fire,  grew 
again. 

"  O  Rama,  having  spoken  thus  to  Dashagriva,  the  Grandsire  of 
the  Worlds  said  to  Bibishana : — "  '  O  My  Dear  Bibishana,  thou 
whose  intellect  is  fixed  on  virtue,  I  am  gratified  with  thee,  choose 
a  boon,  O  Righteous  and  Pious  One.' 

"  Then  the  pure-souled  Bibishana,  who  radiated  good  qualities 
as  the  moon  her  beams,  spoke  with  joined  palms,  saying : — 

" '  O  Bhagawat,  I  have  endeavoured  to  do  that  which  I  ought 

to  do.    Thou  art  the  Guru  of  the  World ;  if,  in  thy  satisfaction, 

thou  dost  accord  me  a  boon,  then  hear  me,  O  Blessed  Lord. 

May  my  soul  ever  be  fixed  in  righteousness  in  the  midst  of  the 

402 


UTTARA    KANDA 

greatest  adversity.  Without  being  instructed,  may  I  be  able  to 
use  the  Brahma  Weapon.  May  whatever  thoughts  come  to  me, 
wherever  or  in  whatever  state  I  find  myself,  always  conform  to 
virtue  and  may  I  fulfil  my  duty  !  O  Most  Exalted  of  Beings, 
these  are  the  boons  I  consider  to  be  the  most  precious  ;  for  those 
who  follow  dharma  nothing  is  impossible ! ' 

"Then  Prajapati,  full  of  joy,  again  addressed  Bibishana 
saying :- 

"'O  Most  Virtuous  and  Dear  Child,  let  it  be  as  thou  sayest, 
though  thou  wast  born  in  the  Rakshasa  Race,  O  Slayer  of  Thy 
Foes,  no  evil  ever  enters  thy  heart !    I  grant  thee  immortality  1  * 

"  Having  uttered  these  words,  as  Prajapati  was  preparing 
to  accord  a  boon  to  Kumbhakarna,  all  the  Gods,  with  joined 
palms,  addressed  him  thus  : — 

" '  As  for  Kumbhakarna,  do  not  grant  him  any  boons !  Thou 
knowest  well  how  the  Three  Worlds  fear  this  perverse  wretch ! 
In  the  Nandana  Gardens,  seven  Apsaras  and  ten  servants  of 
Mahendra  were  devoured  by  him,  O  Brahma,  as  also  Rishis  and 
men.  Such  are  the  deeds  of  this  Rakshasa  before  receiving  a 
boon  ;  if  one  is  conferred  on  him,  he  may  consume  the  Three 
Worlds !  O  Thou  whose  splendour  is  immeasurable,  feigning  to 
grant  him  a  boon  cause  him  to  become  bemused  ;  in  this  way, 
the  worlds  will  live  in  peace  and  he  will  receive  his  just  deserts.' 

"  Thus  did  the  Gods  speak,  and  Brahma,  born  of  the  lotus, 
thought  on  the  Goddess,  his  consort,  and,  as  soon  as  he  called 
her  to  mind,  Saraswati  appeared  at  his  side  and,  with  joined 
palms  said  to  him : — 

"  *  O  Lord,  I  am  here,  what  shall  I  do  ?  * 

"  Then  Prajapati  answered  that  Goddess,  who  had  come  there, 
saying: — 

" '  O  Thou  who  art  Speech,  be  thou  in  the  mouth  of  that 
Indra  among  the  Rakshasas  and  utter  that  which  the  Gods 
desire.' 

"*So  be  it!  *"  she  answered  and, having  entered  his  mouth, 
Kumbhakarna  said  :— 

"  *  To  sleep  for  innumerable  years,  O  Lord  of  Lords,  this  is 
my  desire  I ' 

" '  May  it  be  so !  * "  answered  Brahma  and,  with  the  Gods,  he 
departed.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  The  Goddess  Saraswati  then  left  the  Rakshasa,  while  Brahma, 
with  the  Gods  ascended  to  the  heavenly  region, 

"When  Saraswati  had  departed,  Kumbhakarna  came  to  himself 
and  that  perverse  wretch,  in  his  misfortune,  reflected  : — 

" '  How  can  such  words  have  passed  my  lips  ?  I  must  have  been 
bemused  by  the  Gods  who  came  hither.' 

"  Having  received  those  various  boons,  the  three  brothers  of 
flaming  energy,  returned  to  the  Sleshmataka  Forest  where  they 
dwelt  happily. 


CHAPTER    I  I 

Dhanada  cedes  Lanka  to  Dashagriva 

**  Sumau,  having  learnt  of  the  boons  that  the  rangers  of  the  night 
had  received,  abandoning  his  fear,  emerged  from  the  nether 
regions,  and  the  companions  of  that  Rakshasa,  Maricha,  Prahasta, 
Virupaksha  and  Mahodara  rushed  out  also  full  of  fury. 

"  Thereafter  Sumali  with  his  friends,  surrounded  by  the  fore- 
most of  the  Rakshasas,  sought  out  Dashagriva  and,  embracing 
him,  said : — 

"  *  By  the  grace  of  heaven,  O  Dear  Child,  the  desire  of  my  heart 
has  been  fulfilled  since  thou  hast  received  these  excellent  boons 
from  the  Lord  of  the  Three  Worlds.  The  great  fear  that  forced 
us  to  abandon  Lanka  in  order  to  take  refuge  in  Rasatala,  into 
which  we  were  precipitated  by  Vishnu,  has  now  been  dissipated  ! 
Many  and  many  a  time,  under  the  threat  of  that  terror,  wc 
abandoned  our  retreat  but,  being  pursued,  together  we  plunged 
into  hell.  Thy  brother,  that  crafty  Lord  of  Wealth,  took 
possession  of  the  City  of  Lanka,  the  abode  of  the  Rakshasas.  If 
it  be  possible  by  conciliation,  gifts  or  force,  to  regain  the  posses- 
sion of  it,  then  do  so,  O  Irreproachable  Hero  !  Thou  wUt  then 
become  the  sovereign  of  Lanka  and,  by  thy  grace,  the  Rakshasa 
Race,  that  has  been  disestablished,  will  be  reinstated;  there* 
after  thou  wilt  reign  over  us  all,  O  Lord.' 

"  Then  Dashagriva  answered  his  maternal  grandfather  who 
stood  near  and  said  :— 

404 


UTTARA    KANDA 

"  *  The  Lord  of  Wealth  is  mine  elder  brother ;  it  is  not  fitting 
that  thou  shouldst  speak  thus.' 

"  Quietly  rebuked  in  this  wise  by  that  Indra  of  the  Rakshasas., 
the  most  powerful  of  them  all,  Sumali,  being  aware  of  his 
intentions,  did  not  insist  further. 

"  Some  time  later,  as  Ravana  continued  to  reside  in  that  place, 
Prahasta  addressed  these  significant  words  to  him  : — 

" '  0  Valiant  Dashagriva,  such  a  speech  is  not  worthy  of  thee ; 
brotherly  love  is  not  the  concern  of  heroes  !  Hear  me !  There 
were  two  sisters  who  loved  each  other  and  who  were 'supremely 
fair ;  they  were  wedded  to  that  Lord  of  Creatures,  the  Prajapati 
Kashyapa,  and  with  him  Aditi  begot  the  Gods,  those  Lords  of 
the  Three  Worlds,  whilst  Diti  begot  the  Daityas.  To  the 
Daityas,  those  virtuous  heroes,  the  earth,  with  its  mountains, 
surrounded  by  the  ocean,  formerly  belonged.  They  waxed 
exceedingly  strong,  nevertheless  they  were  slain  in  war  by  the 
mighty  Vishnu,  who  gave  over  the  imperishable  Triple  World  to 
the  Gods.  Thou  art  therefore  not  the  only  one  to  act  in  opposi- 
tion to  a  brother,  which  was  done  by  the  Gods  and  Asuras. 
Follow  my  counsel  therefore !  * 

"  Dashagriva,  hearing  these  words  was  filled  with  joy  and, 
having  reflected  a  moment,  he  said,  *  It  is  well !  *  and,  in  his 
delight,  that  same  day  the  valiant  Dashagriva  with  his  rangers 
of  the  night  repaired  to  the  wood  bordering  on  Lanka.  Stationed 
on  the  Trikuta  Mountain,  that  ranger  of  the  night  sent  out 
Prahasta,  who  was  skilled  in  speech,  as  his  ambassador,  and  said 
to  him: — 

"  *  Go  speedily,  O  Prahasta,  and  speak  to  the  foremost  of  the 
Nairritas,  addressing  him  in  conciliatory  words,  saying : — 

"  '  This  City  of  Lanka,  O  King,  belongs  to  the  magnanimous 
Rakshasas !  O  My  Friend,  thou  didst  take  possession  of  it ;  it 
is  not  just,  O  Thou  who  art  beyond  reproach  !  If  thou  dost 
restore  it  to  us  now,  O  Hero  of  unrivalled  exploits,  I  shall  be 
gratified  and  justice  will  have  been  maintained.  * 

"  Then  Prahasta  repaired  to  the  City  of  Lanka,  whose  strong 
support  was  Dhanada,  and  addressed  that  Lord  of  Wealth  of 
illustrious  lineage  in  the  following  words : — 

"  '  I  have  been  deputed  by  thy  brother  Dashagriva,  who  is  near 
at  hand,  that  long-armed  hero  who  is  pious  and  the  foremost  of 
2d  405 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

warriors,  to  come  hither  and  my  words  are  those  of  Dashanana, 
O  Lord  of  Wealth! 

"  *  This  ravishing  city,  O  Large-eyed  Hero,  was  formerly  held 
by  the  Rakshasas  of  terrible  exploits,  whose  chief  was  Sumali. 
It  is  on  this  account,  dear  son  of  Vishravas,  that  Dashagriva  asks 
thee  to  restore  it  to  them ;  this  request  is  made  in  all  friendli- 
ness. * 

"  Having  heard  Prahasta,  Vaishravana  replied  in  words  worthy 
of  one  who  is  skilled  in  speech  and  said : — 

" '  Lanka  was  bestowed  on  me  by  my  sire  when  it  had  been 
abandoned  by  the  rangers  of  the  night ;  I  have  peopled  it  by 
inducements  of  gifts,  honours  and  every  kind  of  privilege.  Now 
go  and  bring  this  answer  to  Dashagriva — "  The  city  and  the 
kingdom  under  my  dominion  are  thine  also,  O  Long-armed 
Hero,  enjoy  this  realm  without  restriction;  share  this  dominion 
and  its  riches  with  me  without  division." ' 

"  Having  spoken  thus,  that  Lord  of  Wealth  went  to  visit  his 
sire  and  paying  obeisance  to  him  related  the  nature  of  Ravana's 
request,  saying : — 

"  *  0  My  Father,  Dashagriva  has  sent  a  messenger  to  me, 
saying,  "  Give  up  the  City  of  Lanka  that  was  formerly  occupied 
by  the  Rakshasa  Race."  What  shall  I  do  now,  O  Blessed  One, 
tell  me  ? ' 

"  On  this  enquiry,  the  Brahmarishi  Vishravas,  foremost  of  the 
ascetics,  said  to  Dhanada  who  stood  before  him  with  joined 
palms : — 

" '  Hear  me,  O  My  Son,  the  long-armed  Dashagriva  has  spoken 
of  this  matter  in  my  presence  and  I  have  often  rebuked  him ;  he 
is  exceedingly  wicked  and,  in  my  wrath,  I  said  to  him  "  Thou 
wilt  be  destroyed ;  it  were  better  for  thee  to  listen  to  my  words 
which  are  fraught  with  reason  and  integrity  ".  He  is  perverse 
however,  and  the  boons  he  has  received  have  so  intoxicated  him 
that  he  can  no  longer  discriminate  between  what  is  just  and 
unjust  It  is  on  account  of  my  curse  that  he  has  fallen  into  this 
lamentable  condition.  Do  thou  therefore  retire  to  Mount 
Kailasha,  that  support  of  the  earth,  O  Long-armed  Hero,  and 
leave  Lanka  with  thy  followers  at  once.  In  that  place  the  en- 
chanting Mandakini,  the  most  excellent  of  rivers  flows,  whose 
waters  are  covered  with  golden  lotuses  radiant  as  the  sun,  and 
406 


UTTARA    KANDA 

Kumuda,  Utpala  and  other  varieties  of  water-lilies  of  sweet 
fragrance.  Devas,  Gandharvas,  Apsaras,  Uragas  and  Kinneras 
sojourn  there,  constantly  disporting  themselves.  It  is  not 
fitting,  O  Dhanada,  that  thou  shouldst  enter  into  combat  with 
that  Rakshasa,  for  thou  art  conversant  with  the  special  boons  he 
has  received.' 

"  Hearing  this  reply  and  obedient  to  the  counsel  of  his  venerable 
sire,  Dhanada  left  Lanka  with  his  consort,  his  sons,  his  ministers, 
his  vehicles  and  his  wealth. 

"  Meantime  Prahasta  had  sought  out  the  mighty  Dashagriva  and, 
with  a  joyous  heart,  said  to  him  in  the  midst  of  his  counsellors  : — 

"  *  The  City  of  Lanka  is  now  free,  Dhanada  has  abandoned  it 
and  has  departed.  Do  thou  establish  thyself  therein  so  that, 
with  us,  thou  canst  fulfil  thy  duty/ 

"  Thus  did  Prahasta  speak,  and  the  all-powerful  Dashagriva 
invaded  Lanka  with  his  brothers,  his  army  and  his  court.  As 
the  Gods  enter  heaven,  so  did  that  enemy  of  the  Celestials  enter 
that  city  that  Dhanada  had  just  deserted  and  which  was  divided 
by  well-planned  highways.  Enthroned  by  the  rangers  of  the 
night,  Dashanana  installed  himself  in  that  city,  which  was  filled 
with  Rakshasas  resembling  dark  clouds. 

"  The  Lord  of  Wealth,  however,  in  reverence  for  his  father's 
words,  built  a  city  on  Mount  Kailasha  which  was  immaculate  as 
the  moon,  adorned  with  splendid  palaces  sumptuously  decorated, 
as  Purandara  constructed  Amaravati. 


CHAPTER     12 

The  Marriages  of  the  Rakshasas 

"  The  foremost  of  the  Rakshasas,  having  been  anointed  king, 
with  his  brother  began  to  consider  giving  his  sister  in  marriage. 
He  therefore  gave  that  Rakshasi  to  the  King  of  the  Kalakas  and 
the  Lord  of  the  Danavas  himself  presented  Shurpanakha,  his 
sister,  to  Vidyujjihva. 

"  This  being  accomplished,  that  night-ranger  left  for  the  chase 
and  thereafter  he  beheld  the  son  of  Diti,  Maya,  O  Rama.    Seeing 
407 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

him  accompanied  by  a  young  girl,  that  Rakshasa,  Dashagriva 
said  to  him : — 

" '  Who  art  thou  wandering  in  the  forest  that  is  devoid  of  man 
or  beast  ?  How  is  it  that  thou  art  in  the  company  of  this  youthful 
maiden  whose  eyes  resemble  a  doe's  ?  '  " 

"  O  Rama,  to  this  question,  put  to  him  by  that  ranger  of  the 
night,  Maya  replied,  saying : — 

" '  Hear  me  and  I  will  tell  thee  the  truth !  There  was  a  nymph 
named  Hema  of  whom  thou  hast  already  heard.  The  Gods 
bestowed  her  on  me,  as  Pauloma  was  given  to  Shatafcratu.  Full 
of  love  for  her,  I  passed  centuries  at  her  side  when  she  was  taken 
from  me  by  the  Gods.  Thirteen  years  passed  and  in  the 
fourteenth,  I  built  a  golden  city  which  I  decorated  with  diamonds 
and  emeralds  by  the  aid  of  my  magic  powers.  There  I  dwelt, 
deprived  of  Hema,  sad,  dejected  and  extremely  wretched. 
Thereafter,  taking  my  daughter  with  me,  I  left  that  city  in  order 
to  retire  to  the  forest.  This  is  my  child,  O  King,  who  was 
brought  up  in  Hema's  lap  and  here  I  am  seeking  a  husband  for 
her.  A  daughter  is  a  great  calamity,  at  least  for  all  those  who 
have  regard  to  her  honour.  In  truth,  she  is  a  source  of  anxiety 
to  the  family  of  her  father  and  that  of  her  mother. 

" '  Two  sons  were  also  born  to  me  by  my  wife ;  the  first  was 
Mayavi,  O  Dear  Friend,  and  Dundubhi  followed  immediately.  I 
have  told  thee  the  whole  truth  in  accordance  with  thy  wish ! 
And  now,  My  Dear  Son,  I  would  know  something  of  thee,  who 
art  thou  ? ' 

"  At  these  words  the  Rakshasa  answered  respectfully  : — 

" '  I  am  of  Poulastya's  race  and  my  name  is  Dashagriva,  my 
father  was  the  Sage  Vishravas,  who  was  the  third  son  of  Brahma.' " 

"  On  hearing  these  words  of  that  Indra  among  the  Rakshasas,  O 
Rama,  indicating  that  he  was  the  son  of  a  great  Sage,  Maya,  the 
foremost  of  the  Danavas  wished  to  give  his  daughter  to  him. 
Taking  her  hand  in  his,  Maya  addressed  that  King  of  the 
Rakshasas,  saying : — 

" '  O  King,  this  child,  whose  mother  was  the  nymph  Hema,  the 
youthful  Mandodari,  for  such  is  her  name,  do  thou  accept  as  thy 
consort.' 

"  *  Let  it  be  so !  *  answered  Dashagriva,  whereupon  igniting  a 
fire  there,  he  took  her  hand  in  his,  O  Rama.  Maya  was 
408 


UTTARA    KANDA 

conversant  with  the  curse  that  Dashagriva's  sire,  that  treasury  of 
asceticism  had  pronounced,  nevertheless  he  bestowed  his 
daughter  in  marriage  on  him,  knowing  him  to  be  the  offspring 
of  the  Grandsire  of  the  World.  At  the  same  time,  he  gave  him 
a  marvellous  spear  which  he  had  obtained  through  his  supreme 
penances.  It  was  with  this  weapon  that  Ravana  wounded 
Lakshmana.  Then,  having  brought  about  this  marriage,  the 
Lord  of  Lanka  returned  to  that  city. 

"  There,  with  their  consent,  he  chose  two  wives  for  his  two 
brothers ;  the  daughter  of  Virochana,  named  Vajravala,  was 
given  by  him  to  Kumbhakarna,  and  Bibishana  received  as  wife 
the  virtuous  Sarama,  the  daughter  of  the  King  of  the  Gand- 
harvas,  the  magnanimous  Shailusha,  and  she  had  been  born  on 
the  shores  of  the  Lake  Manasa. 

"  At  that  time  in  the  rainy  season,  the  waters  of  the  Manasa 
Lake  were  swollen  and  the  mother  of  the  girl  cried  out  affection- 
ately, *  Do  not  overflow,  O  Lake ! 1 '  Thereafter  the  girl  was 
called  Sarama.9 

"  These  alliances  having  been  concluded,  the  Rakshasas  gave 
themselves  up  to  pleasure,  each  with  his  own  consort,  as  the 
Gandharvas  in  the  Nandana  Gardens. 

"  And  Mandodari  gave  birth  to  a  child  with  the  voice  of  a 
thunder-cloud,  he  who  is  known  to  thee  as  Indrajita.  Scarcely 
had  he  been  born  than  that  son  of  Ravana  began  to  roar  with  a 
terrible  voice,  like  unto  thunder,  and  the  city  was  deafened,  O 
Raghava.  His  father  therefore  called  him  Meghanada  ;3  and  he 
grew  up  in  the  magnificent  private  apartments,  hidden  in  the 
lap  of  the  foremost  of  women,  as  a  fixe  is  concealed  under 
shavings ;  and  that  son  of  Ravana  tilled  his  mother  and  rather 
with  joy.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 


CHAPTER     13 

Ravana's  Crimes 

"  Some  time  later,  the  Lord  of  the  Worlds  sent  Nidra1  to  Kum- 
bhakarna  in  the  fonn  of  overpowering  sleep  and  Kumbhakama 
said  to  his  brother,  who  was  present : — 

"'0  King,  sleep  holds  me  in  thrall,  prepare  a  refuge  for 
me.* 

"  Therefore  the  king  selected  some  artisans,  like  unto  Vish- 
vakarma,  who  constructed  a  splendid  dwelling  for  Kumbhakama, 
a  league  in  expanse  and  two  in  length  which  was  exceedingly 
sumptuous  and  secluded.  On  every  side,  it  was  decorated  with 
columns  of  crystal  encrusted  with  gold ;  the  stairways  were 
made  of  emerald  with  rows  of  small  bells  hanging  from  the 
carved  ivory  galleries,  the  floors  being  of  diamond  and 
crystal. 

"  All  should  have  been  constantly  and  wholly  happy  in  that 
place,  which  was  enchanting  and  luxurious  in  every  way,  and 
which  was  built  by  the  Rakshasas  and  resembled  a  sacred  cave 
in  the  Meru  Mountain.  It  was  there,  overcome  by  slumber, 
that  the  mighty  Kumbhakama  rested  innumerable  years  without 
waking. 

"Whilst  his  brother,  the  mighty  Kumbhakama,  overcome  by 
Nidra,  slept  for  thousands  of  years  without  waking,  Dashanana, 
of  unbridled  passions,  harassed  the  Devas,  Rishis,  Yakshas  and 
Gandharvas  and  overran  their  beautiful  parks  and  groves  like  a 
madman,  laying  them  waste ;  and  that  Rakshasa  churned  up  the 
rivers,  like  an  elephant  disporting  itself,  agitating  the  trees  like 
a  violent  tempest  and  striking  the  hills  as  if  by  lightning. 

"  Hearing  of  Dashagriva's  exploits,  the  virtuous  Lord  of  Wealth, 
reflecting  that  he  was  his  own  brother,  for  the  honour  of  bis 
race  and  desirous  of  manifesting  fraternal  affection,  sent  a 
messenger  to  Lanka  in  Dashagriva's  interests. 

"  Then  the  messenger,  entering  the  city,  approached  Bibishana 

1  Nidra— The  Personification  of  Steep. 

4IO 


UTTARA    KANDA 

who  received  him  with  honour  and  enquired  concerning  his 
visit.  After  asking  about  the  welfare  of  Dhanadaand  his  kinsfolk, 
Bibishana  brought  him  to  Dashanana  in  the  assembly  hall 
where  he  was  resting. 

"  Beholding  the  king  blazing  in  his  own  effulgence,  the 
messenger  said  : — '  Hail  to  thee,  O  King '  and  having  paid 
obeisance  with  these  words,  stood  silent  awhile.  At  that  time 
Dashagriva  was  reclining  on  a  sumptuous  couch  adorned  with  rich 
coverings  whereupon  the  messenger  addressed  him  saying : — 

" '  O  King,  I  bring  thee  the  words  uttered  by  thy  brother  in 
their  entirety — '  Between  us  two,  equality  of  conduct  should 
exist  as  among  others  of  our  race.  A  truce  to  these  evil  deeds  ! 
From  now  on  comport  thyself  in  a  seemly  manner  and,  if  possible, 
take  righteousness  as  thy  guide !  I  have  seen  the  Nandana 
Gardens  laid  waste  and,  it  is  said,  that  the  Rishis  have  been 
persecuted ;  the  measures  that  the  Gods  are  taking  against  thee 
are  known  to  me.  I  have  been  disregarded  by  thee  on  countless 
occasions,  but  even  if  a  youthful  person  err,  he  should  be 
protected  by  his  relatives. 

"  *  Having  repaired  to  the  Himavat  Plateau  to  practice  dharma 
and  subjugate  my  senses,  I  forced  myself  to  undergo  penance  in 
order  to  gratify  the  Lord  Mahadeva ;  there  I  beheld  that  divine  God 
accompanied  by  Uma  and  a  glance  from  my  left  eye  fell  on  the 
Goddess  1  "  Who  is  this  woman  ?  "  I  asked  myself,  desiring 
this  knowledge  and  for  no  other  reason,  for  Rudrani  had 
assumed  an  unparalleled  form.  Then  the  Goddess,  by  her 
celestial  power,  consumed  my  left  eye,  which  grew  yellow  and 
the  light  became  obscured  as  if  by  dust. 

" '  Thereupon  I  repaired  to  another  vast  mountain  plateau 
and  remained  there  eight  hundred  years  observing  silence. 
Having  completed  that  penance,  the  God  Maheshwara  came  to 
me  and,  highly  gratified,  said  : — 

"  * "  I  am  satisfied  with  thine  austerities  O  Virtuous  and  Saintly 
Ascetic.  This  vow  has  been  fulfilled  by  me  and  by  thee,  O  Lord 
ofRishis ;  noneothercouldhaveobservedasimilarmortification. 
These  practices  are  extremely  rigid  and  I  myself  formerly 
followed  them  also.  Grant  me  thy  friendship  therefore,  0 
Sinless  One,  thou  hast  conquered  me  and  thy  penance  has  been 
fruitful.  As  the  Goddess,  whose  form  thou  didst  look  upon, 
4x1 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

burnt  up  thy  left  eye,  turning  it  yellow,  thou  shalt  be  named 
EkakshipingaU.1 " 

"  '  Having  thus  contracted  a  friendship  with  Shankara,  I  took 
leave  of  him  and,  on  my  return,  learnt  of  thine  evil  conduct. 
Abandon  this  impious  course  that  will  bring  dishonour  on  our 
race.  The  Gods  with  the  hosts  of  Rishis  are  considering  how 
they  may  destroy  thee.' 

"  Hearing  these  words,  Dashagriva,  his  eyes  red  with  anger, 
clenching  his  fists  and  teeth,  answered  him  thus  : — 

" '  O  Messenger,  I  knew  what  thou  wast  about  to  utter ! 
Neither  art  thou  my  brother  nor  is  he  who  sent  thee ;  for  the 
Lord  of  Wealth  is  not  speaking  in  mine  interests  !  That  fool 
forces  me  to  hear  of  his  friendship  with  Maheshwara  !  This 
speech  of  thine  is  intolerable.  I  have  borne  it  till  now,  for  he  is 
mine  elder  brother  and,  as  such,  it  is  not  fitting  that  I  should  slay 
him.  Now,  hearing  thine  address,  this  is  my  resolve*—'  By  the 
strength  of  mine  arms,  I  shall  conquer  the  Three  Worlds. 
Solely  on  his  account,  I  shall  dispatch  the  Four  Guardians  of  the 
World  to  the  region  of  Yama  !  ' 

"  Having  spoken  thus,  the  Lord  of  Lanka,  Ravana,  slew  the 
messenger  with  a  single  stroke  of  his  sword  and  gave  him  to 
the  wicked  Rakshasas  to  devour.  Thereafter,  ascending  his 
chariot  amidst  acclamations,  in  his  eagerness  to  subdue  the 
Three  Worlds,  he  set  out  to  seek  the  Lord  of  Wealth. 


CHAPTER    14 

The  Combat  between  Ravana  and  the  Yakshas 

"  Ravana,  proud  of  his  strength,  surrounded  by  his  six  ministers, 
Mahodara,  Prahasta,  Maricha,  Shuka,  Sarana  and  Dhumraksha, 
those  heroes,  who  dreamt  only  of  war,  departed,  as  if  in  his  fury 
he  would  consume  the  worlds. 

"  Then  he  traversed  cities,  rivers,  mountains,  forests  and  woods 
and  soon  came  to  Mount  Kailasha.  Hearing  that  the  Lord  of 
the  Rakshasas,  eager  to  fight,  full  of  insolence  and  wickedness 

1  EkakshipingaU — Yellow-eyed. 

412 


UTTARA    KANDA 

accompanied  by  his  counsellors,  had  established  himself  on  the 
mountain,  the  Yakshas  dared  not  remain  there  for  fear  of  him. 
Then  they  said  to  each  other,  *  This  is  the  brother  of  our  King ' 
and,  knowing  this,  they  approached  Dhaneshwara  and,  coming 
into  his  presence,  they  imparted  his  brother's  intentions  to  him. 
Thereupon,  with  Dhanada's  permission,  they  set  out  joyfully  in 
order  to  give  battle. 

"  The  impact  of  those  valiant  troops  of  the  King  of  the  Nairritas 
was  as  violent  as  the  sea  ;  and  the  mountains  seemed  to  be  riven 
asunder,  whilst  a  furious  struggle  ensued  amongst  the  followers 
of  the  Rakshasas  and,  seeing  his  army  thrown  into  disorder, 
Dashagriva,  the  ranger  of  the  night,  after  many  encouraging 
shouts,  flew  into  a  rage.  Then  the  companions  of  the  King  of 
the  Rakshasas  of  redoubtable  valour,  each  took  on  a  thousand 
Yakshas.  Smitten  with  blows  from  maces,  iron  bars,  swords, 
picks  and  darts,  Dushana,  scarcely  able  to  breathe,  was  over- 
whelmed by  a  rain  of  weapons  which  fell  thick  and  fast  like  hail 
from  the  clouds.  Nevertheless  he  remained  unmoved  under  the 
shafts  of  the  Yakshas,  as  a  mountain  that  the  clouds  flood  with 
innumerable  showers. 

"  Thereafter,  that  hero,  brandishing  his  mace  like  unto  Kala's 
sceptre,  flung  himself  on  the  Yakshas  whom  he  hurled  into 
Yama's  abode.  Like  unto  fire,  flaming  up  on  account  of  the  wind, 
consuming  a  heap  of  grass  or  dried  faggots  which  are  scattered 
about,  so  did  he  destroy  the  army  of  the  Yakshas. 

"  And  his  ministers,  Mahodara,  Shuka  and  the  others,  only 
suffered  a  few  of  the  Yakshas  to  escape,  who  resembled  clouds 
dispersed  by  the  wind.  Overwhelmed  with  blows  and  broken, 
they  fell  in  the  fight,  filled  with  fury,  biting  their  lips  with  their 
sharp  teeth.  And  some  of  the  Yakshas,  exhausted,  clung  to  each 
other,  their  weapons  broken,  and  sank  down  on  the  battlefield  as 
dykes  give  way  before  a  surge  of  waters.  With  those  who  were 
slain  ascending  to  heaven,  those  who  fought  rushing  hither  and 
thither  and  the  companies  of  Rishis  witnessing  the  scene,  there 
was  not  a  single  space  left  anywhere. 

"  Beholding  the  foremost  of  the  Yakshas  scattered  despite  their 

valour,  the  mighty  Lord  of  Wealth  despatched  other  Yakshas 

and,  at  his  call,  O  Rama,  a  Yaksha  named  Samyodhakantaka 

instantly  rushed  out  at  the  head  of  a  large  force.   Struck  by  him 

413 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

in  the  fight,  as  by  a  second  Vishnu  with  his  discus,  Maricha  fell 
to  the  earth  like  a  star  falling  from  the  heights  of  Mount  Kailasha, 
ts  merits  exhausted. 

"Thereafter,  that  Ranger  of  the  Night,  regaining  consciousness, 
gathered  up  his  strength  in  a  moment  and  entered  into  combat 
with  the  Yaksha,  who  having  been  defeated,  fled.  Meantime 
Dashagriva,  his  limbs  loaded  with  ornaments  of  gold,  silver  and 
emerald,  advanced  to  the  very  portals  of  the  outer  defences  and, 
seeing  that  Ranger  of  the  Night  enter,  the  doorkeeper  sought  to 
prevent  him ;  but  the  Rakshasa  forced  bis  way  in,  whereupon 
the  Yaksha  seized  hold  of  him.  Seeing  himself  checked,  O 
Rama,  he  was  not  discouraged  and  began  to  break  down  the 
door,  whilst  the  Yaksha,  overwhelmed  by  his  blows,  streaming 
with  blood,  looked  like  a  mountain  from  which  minerals  are 
pouring. 

"  Though  struck  by  the  Yaksha  with  the  door-post,  that  hero 
was  not  slain  on  account  of  the  rare  gifts  received  from  Swyam- 
bhu,  and  in  his  turn,  arming  himself  with  the  same  post,  he 
struck  the  Yaksha  who,  his  body  reduced  to  dust,  disappeared, 
leaving  no  trace. 

"  Thereupon,  witnessing  the  strength  of  the  Rakshasas,a  general 
stampede  took  place  among  the  Yakshas,  who,  mad  with  terror, 
sought  refuge  in  the  rivers  and  the  caves,  throwing  away  their 
arms,  exhausted,  their  features  distorted. 


chapter    i  5 

The  Combat  between  Ravana   and  Dhanada.     Ravana  seizes 
Pushpaka 

"  Seeing  the  foremost  of  the  Yakshas  fleeing  in  their  thousands, 
the  Lord  of  Wealth  said  to  the  powerful  Manibhadra  : — 

"'O  Prince  of  the  Yakshas,  slay  that  wicked  Ravana  of  evil 
ways  and  deliver  the  valiant  and  heroic  Yakshas  ! ' 

"  At  this  command,  the  long-armed  and  invincible  Manibhadra 
set  out  to  fight  surrounded  by  four  thousand  Yakshas  and  they 
hurled  themselves  on  the  Rakshasas,  whom  they  struck  with 
4x4 


UTTARA    KANDA 

blows  from  maces,  bars,  javelins,  lances,  swords  and  clubs.  And 
they  entered  into  a  violent  struggle,  tailing  on  the  foe  with  the 
swiftness  of  birds  of  prey,  crying  'Advance  !  Advance !  * 
'Yield!'   *  Never!'    'Fight!* 

"  Beholding  that  formidable  combat,  the  Devas,  Gandharvas, 
Rishis  and  Chanters  of  die  Veda  were  extremely  astonished.  A 
thousand  of  the  Yakshas  fell  under  Prahasta's  blows  in  the  conflict 
and  that  irreproachable  Hero  Mahodara  slew  a  further  thousand, 
whilst,  in  his  fury,  O  Prince,  Maricha,  thirsting  to  fight,  slew 
two  thousand  of  the  enemy  in  the  twinkling  of  an  eye. 

"  On  their  side,  the  Yakshas  fought  valiantly  but  the  Rakshasas 
called  upon  their  powers  of  magic  and  thus  gained  ascendancy 
in  the  combat,  O  Lion  among  Men.  While  wrestling  with 
Dhumraksha  in  the  great  struggle,  Manibhadra  received  a 
violent  blow  in  the  chest  from  a  pike  but  remained  unmoved,  and 
he,  in  his  turn,  struck  the  Titan  Dhumraksha  on  the  bead 
whereupon  he  fell  senseless. 

"  Seeing  Dhumraksha  wounded  and  covered  with  blood, 
Dashanana  hurled  himself  on  Manibhadra  in  the  thick  of  the 
fray  and,  while  he  was  rushing  on  him  in  fury,  the  foremost  of 
the  Yakshas,  Manibhadra,  pierced  him  with  three  darts.  Wounded, 
Dashagriva  struck  a  blow  at  Manibhadra's  diadem  which 
fell  to  one  side  and,  from  that  day,  he  was  known  as  '  Parsh- 
vamauli  V 

"Manibhadra,  having  been  put  to  flight  despite  his  valour,  a 
great  clamour  arose  on  the  mountain,  O  King.  From  afar,  the 
Lord  of  Wealth,  who  was  armed  with  a  mace  and  surrounded 
by  Shukra,  Prausthapada,  Padma  and  Shakha,  beheld  Ravana, 
and,  seeing  his  brother  in  the  field,  having  lost  all  dignity, 
deprived  of  his  glory  on  account  of  the  curse,  the  sagacious 
Kuvera  addressed  him  in  words  worthy  of  the  House  of  his 
Grandsire,  saying  :— 

"  *  As  despite  my  warning,  thou  dost  not  desist,  O  Perverse 
Wretch,  thou  shalt  recognize  the  consequences  in  the  future, 
when  thou  hast  fallen  into  hell.  He  who  through  heedlessness 
drinks  poison  and  when  he  realises  it,  in  his  delusion,  does  not 
refrain,  will  know  the  results  of  his  act  in  its  effects.  The  Gods 
do  not  necessarily  approve  even  dharmic  actions,  how  much 

1  Parshv&mauli — '  One  whoee  diadem  is  awry  '. 

415 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

less  those  that  bring  about  such  a  condition  as  thine;  it  is 
because  of  this  that  thou  art  reduced  to  this  state  and  thou  dost 
not  appear  to  be  aware  of  it.  He  who  does  not  honour  his 
mother,  rather,  a  brahmin  or  a  preceptor,  will  reap  the  fruit  of 
his  fault  when  he  falls  under  the  sway  of  the  Lord  of  Death. 
That  fool  who  does  not  mortify  his  body  will  suffer  hereafter, 
when  after  death  he  enters  the  region  that  his  deeds  have  merited. 
No  wicked  man  sees  bis  designs  fulfilled  as  he  would  have 
wished  ;  as  he  sows  so  shall  he  reap.  In  this  world,  prosperity, 
beauty,  power,  sons,  wealth  and  prowess  are  all  attained  by 
pious  acts.  Given  over  to  such  iniquitous  deeds,  thou  wilt  go 
to  hell.  I  will  not  parley  with  thee  further ;  thus  should  one 
act  in  respect  of  evil-doers !  * 

"  At  these  words  of  Dhanada,  which  were  addressed  to  Ravana's 
counsellors  led  by  Maricha,  they  being  struck,  turned  and  fled. 
Dashagriva,  however,  who  had  received  a  blow  on  the  head  from 
the  mace  of  that  powerful  Lord  of  the  Yakshas,  did  not  move. 
Thereafter  Yaksha  and  Rakshasa  entered  into  a  fierce  and  pro- 
longed duel,  experiencing  no  fatigue,  and  Dhanada  loosed  the 
Fire-weapon  on  the  Lord  of  the  Titans,  who  parried  it  with  the 
Varuna  weapon.  Then  Ravana,  having  recourse  to  magic, 
natural  to  a  Rakshasa,  transformed  himself  in  a  thousand  ways 
in  order  to  slay  his  adversary,  and  that  Ten-necked  One  assumed 
the  form  of  a  tiger,  a  boar,  a  cloud,  a  mountain,  an  ocean,  a  tree, 
a  Yaksha  and  a  Daitya.  Thus,  though  wearing  many  forms,  his 
own  remained  hidden.  Thereafter  seizing  hold  of  a  mighty 
weapon,  Dashagriva,  whirling  it  round,  brought  that  enormous 
mace  down  on  the  head  of  Dhanada  and  the  blow  knocked  the 
Lord  of  Wealth  senseless,  who  fell  covered  with  blood,  like  unto 
an  Ashoka  Tree  whose  roots  have  been  severed. 

"  Then  Padma  and  other  Rishis  surrounded  Dhanada  and  bore 
him  through  the  sky  to  the  Nandana  Wood. 

"  Having  vanquished  Dhanada,  the  foremost  of  the  Rakshasas, 
with  a  joyful  heart,  as  a  sign  of  victory,  seized  the  Chariot 
Pushpaka,  that  was  furnished  with  golden  pillars  and  doors  of 
emerald,  hung  with  strings  of  pearls  and  planted  with  trees 
bearing  fruit  in  all  seasons ;  swift  as  thought,  it  ranged 
everywhere  at  will  in  its  aerial  flight.  Possessed  of  golden  stair- 
ways, encrusted  with  gems  and  with  floors  of  refined  gold,  that 
4x6 


UTTARA    KANDA 

indestructible  vehicle  of  the  Gods,  a  perpetual  joy  to  the  eyes 
and  heart,  that  masterpiece  created  by  Vishvafcarma  at  Brahma's 
command,  with  its  countless  ornaments,  was  indeed  a  marvel. 
All  that  could  be  desired  was  to  be  found  therein  and  it  was  of  a 
magnificence  nothing  could  surpass ;  neither  too  hot  nor  too 
cold,  it  was  pleasantly  temperate  at  all  seasons. 

"  Ascending  that  chariot,  which  he  had  acquired  by  his  prowess, 
coursing  wheresoever  he  would,  the  King  Ravana,  in  his  pride  and 
wickedness,  deemed  himself  to  have  overcome  the  Three  Worlds. 
Having  conquered  Vaishravana,  he  descended  from  Mount 
Kailasha  and,  having  by  his  prowess  obtained  this  great  victory, 
that  Ranger  of  the  Night,  dazzling  in  bis  diadem  and  necklace  of 
flawless  pearls,  in  his  marvellous  chariot,  blazed  like  fire. 


CHAPTER    I  6 

The  Origin  of  Ravana's  Name 

"  O  rama,  having  vanquished  his  brother,  the  supreme  Lord  of 
the  Rakshasas  went  to  the  great  fen  where  Mahasena  was  born ; 
and  Dashagriva  beheld  that  vast  and  golden  expanse  of  reeds 
sending  forth  shafts  of  light  like  unto  a  second  sun.  Ascending 
the  mountain  which  rose  in  the  centre  of  that  fen,  O  Rama,  he 
observed  that  the  Chariot  Pushpaka  was  suddenly  deprived  of 
motion. 

"  Thereupon  that  King  of  the  Rakshasas,  surrounded  by  his 
attendants,  reflected  : — '  How  is  this,  the  chariot  has  halted  ? 
Why  is  it  not  still  moving  since  it  was  created  to  follow  its  master's 
will  ?  Wherefore  does  the  Pushpaka  Car  not  go  wheresoever  I 
desire  ?  Is  this  not  the  doing  of  some  inhabitant  of  the  mountain'? 

"  Then,  O  Rama,  the  intelligent  Marietta  said  to  him : — 

"  *  It  is  not  without  reason,  O  King,  that  the  Chariot  Pushpaka 
moves  no  longer.  Without  doubt  it  is  only  able  to  serve  Dhanada 
and,  since  it  is  separated  from  that  Lord  of  Wealth,  it  has  become 
motionless !  * 

"  As  he  spoke  thus,  a  fearful  yellow  and  black-hued  dwarf 
appeared,  who  was  extremely  stout  and  possessed  a  shaven  head 
4:7 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  short  arms ;  it  was  Nandi.  Approaching  that  Indra  among 
the  Rakshasas,  that  servant  of  Bhava,  Nandi,  fearlessly  addressed 
him,  saying : — 

"  '  Begone,  O  Dashagriva,  the  Lord  Shankara  is  disporting 
himself  on  this  mountain ;  it  is  forbidden  to  birds,  serpents, 
Yakshas,  Devas,  Gandharvas  and  Rakshasas  to  come  hither  ! ' 

"  Hearing  Nandi's  words,  Ravana,  with  his  earrings  trembling 
in  his  wrath,  his  eyes  red  with  fury,  leapt  down  from  the  Push- 
paka  Chariot  and  approaching  the  foot  of  the  peak,  demanded  : — 

** '  Who  is  this  Shankara  ?  ' 

"  Then  he  beheld  Nandi  standing  at  the  side  of  that  God, 
supporting  himself  on  his  gleaming  trident,  blazing  in  his  own 
effulgence,  like  unto  a  second  Shankara. 

"  Beholding  that  monkey-faced  One,  the  Rakshasa,  in  his 
contempt  laughed  derisively,  roaring  like  a  thunder-cloud. 
Highly  provoked,  the  blessed  Nandi,  Shankara  in  another  form, 
said  to  Dashagriva,  who  stood  near  : — 

"  *  Since  thou  hast  derided  me  in  my  monkey  form,  O  Dasha- 
nana,  by  bursting  into  loud  laughter  resembling  thunder, 
monkeys,  like  unto  myself  in  form,  endowed  with  prodigious 
strength,  shall  be  born  to  destroy  thee  and  thy  race.  Armed  with 
nails  and  teeth,  O  Barbarian,  they  will  descend  like  an  avalanche 
of  rocks,  and  swift  as  thought,  thirsting  to  fight  and,  proud  of  their 
strength,  shall  crush  thy  great  pride  and  thy  high  prowess  with 
that  of  thine  adherents  and  thy  sons.  I  am  well  able  to  slay  thee 
now,  O  Ranger  of  the  Night,  but  it  is  no  longer  necessary  to  put 
thee  to  death  since  thy  previous  acts  have  already  overtaken 
thee.' 

"  Hearing  these  prophetic  utterances  of  that  magnanimous  God, 
the  celestial  gongs  resounded  and  a  rain  of  flowers  fell  from 
the  sky.  Disregarding  Nandi's  words,  the  extremely  powerful 
Dashanana  drew  nearer  to  the  mountain  and  said  : — 

"  *  As  it  is  on  thine  account  that  the  course  of  Pushpaka,  in 
which  I  was  travelling,  has  been  arrested,  I  shall  uproot  the 
mountain,  O  Cowherd  !  What  is  the  nature  of  the  power  which 
enables  Bhava  to  sport  here  continually  like  a  king  ?  He  is  not 
aware  of  what  should  be  known  to  him  and  that  the  moment  for 
him  to  tremble  has  come.' 
"  Speaking  thus,  O  Rama,  he  seized  the  mountain  in  his  arms 
418 


UTTARA    KANDA 

and  shook  it  violently  so  that  the  rocky  mass  vibrated.  In 
consequence  of  the  mountain  quaking,  the  attendants  of  the  God 
were  troubled  and  Parvati  herself,  terrified,  clung  to  the  neck  of 
Maheshwara. 

"  Then,  O  Rama,  Mahadeva,  the  foremost  of  the  Gods,  as  if  in 
sport,  pressed  the  mountain  with  his  great  toe  and,  at  the  same 
time,  he  crushed  Ravana's  arms,  that  resembled  pillars  of 
granite,  to  the  great  consternation  of  all  the  counsellors  of  that 
Rakshasa.  And  he,  in  pain  and  fury,  suddenly  let  forth  a  terrible 
cry,  causing  the  Three  Worlds  to  tremble,  so  that  his  ministers 
thought  it  to  be  the  crash  of  thunder  at  the  dissolution  of  the 
worlds !  Thereupon  the  Gods,  with  Indra  at  their  head, 
stumbled  on  their  way;  the  oceans  became  agitated,  the 
mountains  shook,  and  die  Yakshas,  Vidyadharas  and  Siddhas 
cried  out : — '  What  is  this  ?  Do  thou  pacify  Mahadeva,  the 
Blue-throated  One,  the  Lord  of  Uma ;  apart  from  Him,  there  is 
no  refuge  in  the  world,  O  Dashanana  !  By  hymns  and  prostra- 
tion seek  refuge  with  Him,  propitiated  and  gratified,  Shankara 
will  look  on  thee  with  favour.1 

M  Hearing  the  words  of  his  ministers,  Dashanana,  bowing  before 
Him,  worshipped  the  God  Whose  standard  bears  the  bull,  by 
the  recitation  of  hymns  and  innumerable  sacred  texts.  Thus 
did  that  titan  lament  for  a  thousand  years. 

"  Thereafter  the  Lord  Mahadeva,  propitiated,  released  the  arms 
of  Dashanana  from  under  the  mountain  and  addressed  him 
saying : — 

"'lam  gratified  with  thy  courage  and  endurance,  O  Dasha- 
nana E  When  thou  wast  imprisoned  under  the  rock,  thou  didst 
emit  a  terrible  cry,  striking  terror  in  the  Three  Worlds.  For 
this  reason,  O  King,  from  now  on  thy  name  shall  be  Ravana, 
and  Celestials,  Men,  Yakshas  and  other  Beings  in  the  universe 
shall  call  thee  "  Ravana  " — "  He  who  causes  the  worlds  to  cry 
out  ".  O  Poulastya,1  follow  the  path  that  pleases  thee  without 
fear,  thou  hast  my  sanction  to  depart.' 

"  Thus  spoke  Shambhu  to  the  Lord  of  Lanka  and  he,  in  his 
turn,  said : — 

**  *  O  Mahadeva,  if  thou  art  satisfied,  then  I  pray  thee,  grant  me 
a  boon  t    I  am  not  able  to  be  slain  by  Gods,  Gandharvas,

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Danavas,  Rakshasas,  Guhyakas  or  Nagas  nor  by  any  other  great 
Beings,  I  do  not  take  man  into  account  deeming  him  to  be  too 
insignificant.  I  have  been  granted  a  long  life  by  Brahma,  O 
Destroyer  of  Tripura,  but  I  desire  a  further  lease  of  Jife ,*  do  thou 
confer  this  upon  me,  as  also  a  weapon.' 

"  Thus  spoke  Ravana,  and  Shankara  bestowed  an  exceedingly 
bright  sword  upon  him,  famed  as  Chandrahasa.1  Thereafter 
the  Lord  of  Creatures  accorded  him  a  further  lease  of  life  and, 
handing  him  the  weapon,  Shambhu  said  : — 

" '  Never  treat  this  weapon  with  contempt,  if  thou  dost  dis- 
regard it,  it  will  assuredly  return  to  me  !  * 

"  Having  received  bis  name  from  that  great  God  Maheshwara, 
Ravana  paid  obeisance  to  him  and  re-ascended  his  aerial  Car 
Pushpaka.  Thereafter,  O  Rama,  he  began  to  range  the  entire 
world  subduing  the  foremost  of  warriors,  irresistible  in  combat 
and  those  who  were  filled  with  courage  and  boiling  with  ardour, 
who  dreamt  only  of  war  and  who  perished  with  their  troops  by 
refusing  to  submit  to  him.  But  those,  who  knew  Ravana  to  be 
invincible,  showed  themselves  to  be  more  wary  and  said  to  that 
titan,  proud  of  his  strength,  *  We  have  been  vanquished ! ' 


chapter   17 

The  Story  of  Vedavati 

"  O  RING,  when  the  long-armed  Ravana  was  ranging  the  earth,  he 
came  to  the  Himalayan  Forest  and  began  to  explore  it.  There 
he  beheld  a  young  girl,  radiant  as  a  goddess,  wearing  a  black 
antelope  skin  and  matted  locks,  leading  the  life  of  an  ascetic. 
Seeing  the  youthful  and  lovely  girl  who  was  given  over  to  austere 
practices,  he  was  overcome  by  desire  and  enquired  of  her 
laughingly : — 

"'Why,  O  Blessed  One,  hast  thou  adopted  a  life  so  ill-fitted 
to  thy  years  ?  Assuredly  such  vagaries  do  not  agree  with  thy 
beauty,  O  Timid  Lady,  a  beauty  that  nothing  surpasses,  and 
which  inspires  others  with  desire,  should  not  be  hidden. 

1  He  being  a  descendant  of  Ponlastya. 

420 


UTTARA    KANDA 

" '  Whose  daughter  arc  thou,  O  Fortunate  One?  From  whence 
springs  thy  way  of  life  ?  Who  is  thy  consort,  O  Youthful  Lady 
of  lovely  looks  ?  He  with  whom  thou  art  united  is  fortunate 
indeed!  I  beg  of  thee  to  tell  me  all;  why  these  mortifications?' 

"  Being  thus  questioned  by  Ravana,  that  young  girl,  radiant 
with  beauty  and  rich  in  ascetic  practices,  having  offered  him  the 
traditional  hospitality,  replied  : — 

" '  My  Sire  is  named  Kushadwaja,  a  Brahmarishi  of  immeasur- 
able renown,  the  illustrious  son  of  Brihaspati,  whom  he  equals  in 
wisdom.  I,  bis  daughter  was  born  of  the  speech  of  that  mag- 
nanimous One,  whose  constant  pursuit  is  the  study  of  the  Veda ; 
my  name  is  Vedavati.  At  that  time,  the  Devas,  Gandharvas, 
Yakshas,  Rakshasas  and  Pannagas  approached  my  sire  to  ask 
for  my  hand  but  my  father  did  not  wish  to  give  me  in  marriage 
to  them,  O  King  of  the  Rakshasas,  for  the  reason  which  I  shall 
now  unfold  to  thee ;  listen  attentively,  O  Lion  among  Heroes  ! 

"  *  My  Sire  had  chosen  Vishnu,  Chief  of  the  Gods,  Lord  of  the 
Three  Worlds  Himself,  to  be  my  consort  and  on  this  account  he 
would  not  permit  me  to  wed  any  other.  Hearing  this  the  King 
of  the  Daityas,  Shumbhu,  proud  of  his  strength,  was  highly 
provoked  and,  during  the  night,  while  my  father  slept,  he  was 
slain  by  that  wicked  one.  My  unfortunate  mother,  who  till  then, 
had  been  so  happy,  embracing  my  father's  body,  entered  the  fire. 

'"  Now  I  desire  to  fulfil  his  will  regarding  Narayana;  it  is  He 
to  whom  I  have  given  my  heart.  With  this  intention  I  am  under- 
going a  rigid  penance.  I  have  told  thee  all,  O  King  of  the 
Rakshasas ;  Narayana  is  my  lord ;  I  desire  no  other  than  the 
Supreme  Purusha.  For  the  sake  of  Narayana,  I  have  undergone 
these  severe  mortifications.  Thou  art  known  to  me,  O  King,  go 
hence,  thou  the  offspring  of  Poulastya.  By  the  grace  of  mine 
austerities  I  know  all  that  has  taken  place  in  the  Three  Worlds.' 

"  Thereupon  Ravana,  dismounting  from  his  chariot,  overcome 
by  the  darts  of  the  God  of  Love,  once  more  addressed  that  young 
girl  of  severe  penances,  saying : — 

"  *  O  Lady  of  Lovely  Hips,  thou  art  presumptuous  in  har- 
bouring such  an  ambition ;  it  is  to  the  aged  that  the  accumula- 
tion of  merit  accrues,  O  Thou  whose  eyes  resemble  a  fawn's. 
Thou  art  possessed  of  the  beauty  of  the  Three  Worlds,  O  Timid 
Lady,  but  thy  youth  is  passing  away ;  I  am  the  Lord  of  Lanka 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  am  called  Dashagriva  !  Become  my  consort  and  enjoy  every 
delight  according  to  thy  whim.  Who  is  this  whom  thou  callest 
Vishnu  ?  In  valour,  asceticism,  magnificence  and  strength,  the 
one  thou  lovest  cannot  compare  with  us,  O  Fortunate  and 
Youthful  Lady ! ' 

"As  he  spoke  thus,  Vedavati  cried  out  *  For  shame !  For 
share  e !  *  and  thereafter  addressed  that  Ranger  of  the  Night 
further,  saying  :— 

"  '  Who,  had  he  any  wisdom,  would  fail  to  pay  homage  to  the 
Supreme  Lord  of  the  Three  Worlds,  Vishnu,  Who  is  universally 
revered,  save  thou,  O  Indra  among  the  Rakshasas  ?  * 

"At  these  words  of  Vedavati,  that  Ranger  of  the  Night  seized 
bold  of  the  hair  of  that  young  girl,  whereupon  Vedavati,  in 
indignation,  cut  off  her  hair  with  her  hand  which  had  been 
transformed  into  a  sword.  Burning  with  anger,  she,  as  if  she 
would  consume  that  night-ranger,  kindled  a  brazier  and,  in  her 
eagerness  to  yield  up  her  life,  said  to  him  : — 

**  *  Soiled  by  thy  contact,  O  Vile  Rakshasa,  I  do  not  desire  to 
live  and  shall  throw  myself  into  the  fire  before  thine  eyes. 
Since  thou  hast  affronted  me  in  the  forest,  O  Wretch,  I  shall  be 
reborn  for  thy  destruction.  It  is  not  possible  for  a  woman  to 
slay  an  evil  man  and,  if  I  curse  thee,  my  penances  will  be  ren- 
dered void ;  if,  however,  I  have  ever  given  anything  in  charity 
or  offered  any  sacrifice,  may  I  be  of  immaculate  birth  and  the 
noble  daughter  of  a  virtuous  man/ 

"  So  speaking,  she  threw  herself  into  the  fire  that  she  had 
ignited,  and  straightway  a  rain  of  flowers  fell. 

"  Vedavati  is  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  her  supposed  father,  O 
Strong-armed  Lord,  and  thy  consort,  for  thou  art  the  eternal 
Vishnu.  That  woman,  who,  in  anger,  formerly  cursed  the 
enemy  who  resembled  a  mountain,  destroyed  him  by  appealing 
to  thy  supernatural  power.  Thus  that  goddess  was  reborn 
among  men,  springing  up  like  a  flame  on  the  altar,  from  a  field 
which  was  turned  by  the  blade  of  a  plough.  First  she  was  born 
as  Vedavati  in  the  Golden  Age  and  subsequently,  in  the  Silver 
Age,  she  was  re-born  in  the  family  of  the  magnanimous  Janaka 
in  the  race  of  Mithila,  for  the  destruction  of  that  Rakshasa."

CHAPTER     18 

The  Gods  assume  a  thousand  Forms  in  fear  of  Ravana 

"Vedavati  having  entered  the  fire,  Ravana  remounted  his 
chariot  and  began  to  range  the  earth  once  more.  Having  reached 
Ushirabija,  he  beheld  the  King  Marutta  performing  a  sacrifice 
in  company  with  the  Gods. 

"A  Brahmarishi  named  Samvarta,  the  brother  of  Brihaspati 
himself,  conversant  with  the  tradition,  was  assisting  amidst  the 
Celestial  Host.  Perceiving  the  Rakshasa,  rendered  invincible  on 
account  of  the  boons  he  had  received,  the  Gods,  fearing  an 
outrage  on  his  part,  assumed  the  shape  of  animals. 

"  Indra  became  a  peacock,  Dharmaraja  a  crow,  Kuvera  a 
chameleon  and  Varuna  a  swan.  The  other  Deities  having  escaped 
in  a  like  manner,  O  Slayer  of  Thy  Foes,  Ravana  penetrated  into 
the  place  of  sacrifice  like  an  unclean  dog. 

"Approaching  the  king,  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas 
said  to  him  : — 

"  *  Fight  or  submit ! ' 

"  Then  the  monarch  replied,  '  Who  art  thou  ?  *  to  which 
Ravana,  with  a  sneering  laugh,  answered  : — 

"'lam  charmed  with  thy  simplicity,  seeing  thou  dost  not 
flee  before  me,  Ravana,  the  younger  brother  of  Dhanada.  In 
the  Three  Worlds  can  there  be  any  other  who  is  ignorant  of  my 
strength,  I  who  vanquished  my  brother  and  carried  off  his 
aerial  car? ' 

"  Then  the  King  Marutta  answered  Ravana,  saying  : — 

"  '  Forsooth  thou  art  highly  fortunate  that  thou  hast  triumphed 
over  thine  elder  brother  in  combat.  None  in  the  Three  Worlds 
can  equal  thee  in  glory,  yet  unrighteous  deeds  can  never  be 
commended.  Having  committed  this  foul  act,  thou  dost  preen 
thyself  on  having  vanquished  thy  brother  I  What  course  of 
asceticism  didst  thou  follow  formerly  that  has  earned  thee  this 
boon  ?  I  have  never  heard  aught  equal  to  that  which  thou  hast 
related  to  me.  Halt  where  thou  standest;  never  shalt  thou 
423 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

approach  me  alive !  This  very  hour,  with  my  sharp  arrows,  I 
shall  send  thee  to  the  abode  of  death !  * 

"  Speaking  thus,  the  king,  armed  with  his  bow  and  arrows,  in 
the  height  of  anger,  rushed  out,  but  Samvarta  barred  the  way  ; 
then  the  great  Rishi  said  to  Marutta  : — 

"  *  Hear  the  words  inspired  by  my  attachment  for  thee ! 
Thou  shouldst  not  enter  into  combat.  If  this  sacrifice  in  honour 
of  Maheshwara  remain  uncompleted,  thy  race  will  be  destroyed. 
How  can  one,  who  has  undertaken  a  sacrifice,  fight  ?  How  can 
he  show  anger  ?  Further,  it  is  doubtful  that  thou  wilt  triumph  ; 
the  Rakshasa  is  difficult  to  overcome.' 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  his  Guru,  Marutta,  that  Lord  of  the 
Earth,  throwing  away  his  bow  and  arrows,  grew  calm  and  gave 
himself  wholly  to  the  ceremony. 

"  Then  Shuka,  deeming  he  had  accepted  defeat,  proclaimed 
with  shouts  of  triumph, '  Ravana  is  the  victor  ! ' 

"  Having  devoured  the  great  Rishis,  who  were  present  at  the 
sacrifice,  Ravana,  gorged  with  their  blood,  began  to  range  the 
earth  once  more.  When  he  had  departed,  the  Celestials  with 
Indra  at  their  head  returned  and  spoke  to  those  creatures  whose 
forms  they  had  borrowed. 

"  In  his  delight,  Indra  said  to  the  peacock,  whose  tail  was  dark 
blue  :— 

"  ■  I  am  pleased  with  thee,  O  Virtuous  Bird,  thou  shah  have 
nothing  to  fear  from  serpents  ;  thou  shah  bear  a  thousand  eyes 
on  thy  tail  and  shalt  manifest  thy  joy  when  it  rains,  as  a  testimony 
of  my  satisfaction.11 

"  Such  was  the  boon  conferred  on  the  peacock  by  that  great 
lord.  O  Monarch,  the  tails  of  peacocks,  which  were  dark  blue 
formerly,  have  become  brilliantly  hued  on  account  of  this 
boon. 

"  O  Rama,  Dharmaraja  then  said  to  the  crow,  who  had 
perched  on  the  sacrificial  post : — 

"  *  O  Bird,  I  am  gratified  with  thee,  listen  to  mine  auspicious 
words.  Thou  shalt  not  be  visited  by  the  various  diseases  to 
which  all  beings  are  subject,  for  thou  hast  gratified  me,  be 
assured  thereof !  Through  the  grace  of  the  boon  I  shall  confer 
on  thee,  O  Bird,  thou  shalt  have  no  need  to  fear  death  and  shalt 

*  Indra  being  the  '  Bringer  of  Rain  '. 

424

live  long,  till  thou  art  slain  by  man.  Those  inhabiting  my 
empire,  who  are  tormented  by  hunger,  shall  be  satisfied,  as  also 
their  kinsfolk  when  thou  hast  fed.' 

"  Varuna,  in  his  turn,  said  to  the  swan,  the  King  of  Winged 
Creatures,  who  was  disporting  itself  in  the  waters  of  the  Ganges  :- 
"  *  Thou  shall  appear  in  a  ravishing  and  graceful  form,  radiant 
as  the  lunar  orb,  supremely  beautiful,  white  as  pure  foam.  In 
contact  with  mine  element,1  thou  wilt  rejoice  continually.  Thou 
shalt  taste  a  happiness  that  is  unparalleled,  which  will  be  the 
mark  of  mine  approval ! ' 

"  O  Rama,  formerly  swans  were  not  wholly  white,  their  wings 
were  dark  at  the  tips  and  their  breasts  were  the  colour  of  emerald. 

"  In  his  turn,  Kuvera  addressed  the  chameleon  who  was 
resting  on  a  rock  and  said : — 

"  *  I  confer  on  thee  a  golden  hue  on  account  of  the  pleasure 
thou  hast  given  me.  Thy  head  will  be  of  an  unalterable  golden 
colour  as  a  mark  of  my  favour.' 

"  Such  were  the  boons  conferred  on  those  creatures  after  the 
sacrifice  of  the  Gods,  who,  when  the  ceremony  had  been  com- 
pleted, returned  with  their  king  to  their  abode." 


CHAPTER     19 

Havana  fights  with  Anaranya  who  dies  prophesying 
the  Rakshasa's  End 

"  Having  triumphed  over  Marutta,  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas, 
Dashanana,  ranged  the  royal  cities  thirsty  for  combat  and, 
approaching  the  mighty  monarchs  who  were  the  equals  of 
Mahendra  and  Varuna,  that  Lord  of  the  Titans  said  to  them, 
1  Fight  or  submit !  Thus  have  I  resolved,  there  is  no  escape 
for  you ! ' 

"  Thereupon,  though  not  faint-hearted,  those  sagacious 
monarchs,  fixed  in  their  duty,  took  counsel  together  and,  despite 
their  great  strength,  recognizing  the  superior  power  of  their  foe, 
O  Dear  Child,  all  those  princes,  Dushkanta,  Suratha,  Gadhi, 
Gaya  and  the  King  Pururava,  said  to  him : — '  We  are  defeated !  * 

'  Literally  *  My  body ' — water,  Varuna  being  the  Lord  of  Riven. 

4*5 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"Then  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas  approached 
Ayodhya,  which  was  as  strongly  fortified  by  Anaranya  as  Amara- 
vati  by  Shakra.  Presenting  himself  before  that  Hon  among  men, 
a  king  who  was  equal  to  Purandara  in  valour,  Ravana  said : — 

"  *  Enter  into  combat  with  us  or  admit  defeat,  such  is  our 
mandate !  * 

"  The  King  of  Ayodhya,  Anaranya,  hearing  that  wicked 
Monarch  of  the  Rakshasas  speak  thus,  answered  indignantly : — 

"  *  O  Lord  of  the  Titans,  I  accept  thy  challenge,  stay  and 
make  thy  preparations  speedily  as  I  too  shall  make  mine.' 

"  Thereafter,  though  already  overcome  by  that  which  he  had 
heard  related  and  despite  his  great  prowess,  the  king  with  his 
army  set  out,  in  an  attempt  to  slay  Ravana,  with  his  elephants 
numbering  ten  thousand,  his  horses  a  million,  his  chariots  in 
their  thousands  and  his  infantry,  which,  O  Prince,  covered  the 
whole  earth.  And  that  force  rushed  out  to  fight  with  its  infantry 
and  cavalry  and  a  terrific  and  extraordinary  struggle  ensued 
between  the  King  Anaranya  and  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas. 

"  In  the  grip  of  Ravana's  forces,  the  army  of  that  monarch, 
having  fought  for  a  long  time  and  manifested  supreme  courage, 
was  entirely  destroyed  as  a  libation  poured  into  a  fire  is  wholly 
consumed.  Coming  in  contact  with  those  ranks  projecting 
flames,  the  remaining  battalions  were  completely  annihilated 
like  moths  that  enter  a  brazier. 

"  Beholding  his  vast  army  obliterated  as  hundreds  of  streams 
disappear  in  the  sea  in  which  they  empty  themselves,  the  king, 
transported  with  fury,  stretching  his  bow,  that  resembled  Shakra's, 
advanced  in  the  height  of  anger  towards  Ravana  whereupon  his 
followers,  Maricha,  Shuka  and  Sarana,  fled  like  deer.  Then  that 
descendant  of  Ikshvaku  loosed  eight  hundred  arrows  on  the  head 
of  the  Sovereign  of  the  Rakshasas  but,  as  showers  loosed  from 
the  clouds  on  the  summit  of  a  mountain,  those  shafts  fell  upon 
him  without  inflicting  a  single  wound. 

"  Meantime  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  provoked,  struck  the 
face  of  Anaranya,  unseating  that  king  from  his  chariot  so  that 
the  monarch,  trembling  convulsively,  fell  to  the  earth  helpless,  as  a 
Sala  Tree  struck  down  in  the  forest  by  a  lightning  stroke.  Then 
the  Rakshasa  mockingly  enquired  of  that  descendant  of  the 
Ikshvaku  Race,  saying : — 

436 


UTTARA    KANDA 

" '  What  hast  thou  gained  by  entering  into  combat  with  me  ? 
In  the  Three  Worlds,  none  can  stand  against  me,  O  Chief  of 
Men !  I  deem  that  thou  art  immersed  in  pleasure  and  hast  not 
even  heard  of  my  prowess  ! * 

"  Thus  spoke  Ravana  and  the  king,  scarcely  breathing, 
answered : — 

"  '  What  can  I  do  now  ?  Assuredly  fate  is  inexorable !  It  is 
not  thou  who  hast  conquered  me,  0  Rakshasa,  despite  thy  boast- 
ings, it  is  Time  that  has  overwhelmed  me;  he  is  the  true 
author  of  death  !  What  can  I  do,  now  that  I  have  come  to  the 
end  of  my  days  ?  Nay,  O  Rakshasa,  I  did  not  turn  back  in  this 
fight  with  thee  in  which  I  am  about  to  succumb  but,  on  account 
of  thy  disregard  for  one  of  the  magnanimous  Ikshvakus,  I  tell 
thee  this,  O  Rakshasa: — if  I  have  ever  given  anything  in  charity, 
if  I  have  ever  undertaken  a  sacrifice,  if  I  have  ever  practiced  a 
rigid  penance,  if  I  have  protected  my  subjects,  may  my  words 
prove  true— in  the  House  of  the  magnanimous  Ikshvakus  will  be 
born  a  warrior  named  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha,  who  will 
extinguish  thy  vital  breaths  !  * 

"As  this  curse  was  being  pronounced,  the  sound  of  celestial 
gongs  could  be  heard  and,  from  the  cloud-covered  sky,  a  rain  of 
flowers  fell.  Thereafter  the  king,  that  Indra  among  Monarchs, 
ascended  to  the  region  of  Trivishtapa,  and  that  sovereign  having 
entered  heaven,  the  Rakshasa  went  away." 


CHAPTER     20 

Havana's  Meeting  with  the  Sage  Narada 

"As  the  King  of  the  Rakshasas  was  ranging  the  earth,  sowing 
terror  amongst  its  inhabitants,  he  beheld  Narada,  that  foremost 
of  Munis,  riding  on  a  cloud  and,  having  paid  obeisance  to  him 
and  enquired  as  to  his  welfare,  Dashagriva  questioned  him 
concerning  his  presence  there.  Then  Narada,  the  supremely 
illustrious  and  celestial  Rishi  of  immeasurable  effulgence, 
stationed  on  the  peak  of  a  cloud,  replied  to  Ravana  who  stood  in 
the  aerial  Car  Pushpaka,  saying : — 
427 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  *  O  King  of  the  Rakshasas,  O  My  Friend,  stay  a  moment ! 

0  Son  of  Vishravas,  Offspring  of  a  noble  Race,  I  am  gratified  by 
thy  valiant  exploits.  Vishnu,  overcoming  die  Daityas,  pleased  me 
and  thou  also  hast  filled  me  with  delight  by  harassing  the  Gand- 
harvas  and  Uragas  and  exterminating  them.  I  will  tell  thee 
something  that  should  be  known  to  thee  if  thou  art  willing  to 
hear  it !   Pay  attention  to  my  words,  My  Dear  Son  ! 

" '  Why  destroy  the  world,  O  Dear  Child,  thou  whom  the 
Gods  cannot  slay  ?  This  world  passes  away  and  is  under  the 
power  of  Mrityu ;  it  is  not  worthy  of  thee  to  harass  the  world  of 
mortals,  thou  who  may  not  be  destroyed  by  Suras,  Danavas, 
Daityas,  Yakshas,  Gandharvas  and  Rakshasas.  Who  would  slay 
creatures  who  are  ever  bewildered  in  respect  to  their  welfare  and 
a  prey  to  great  calamities  ?  Who  would  strike  a  world  such  as 
this  which  is  overcome  by  age  and  disease  ?  What  wise  man 
would  enjoy  making  war  on  this  world  of  men  amidst  a  perennial 
stream  of  every  kind  of  affliction  that  visits  it  on  all  sides  ?  How 
can  one  torment  this  world  which  is  perishable,  smitten  by  divine 
forces,  hunger,  thirst  and  old  age  and  assailed  by  misfortune  and 
disappointment  ? 

"  *  Sometimes,  full  of  joy,  men  give  themselves  up  to  music 
and  dancing,  whilst  others  are  crying  out  in  distress,  their  faces 
streaming  with  tears  that  fall  from  their  eyes.  Through  attach- 
ment to  mother,  rather,  children  or  in  affection  for  their  consorts, 
they  rush  into  ills  they  know  not,  then  why  torment  a  world 
already  brought  low  by  nescience?  Assuredly  thou  hast 
heretofore  subdued  the  world  of  men,  O  Dear  One  '  Thou 
shouldst  undoubtedly  descend  to  Yama's  abode ;  it  is  Yama 
whom  thou  shouldst  overcome,  O  Poulastya,1  O  Thou  the 
penetrator  of  hostile  citadels.  When  death  is  subdued,  verily 
the  whole  universe  is  subdued.* 

"  Thus  spoke  Narada,  radiant  in  his  own  effulgence,  where- 
upon the  Lord  of  Lanka  began  to  laugh  and  paying  obeisance 
to  him,  replied : — 

M  *  O  Great  Rishi,  thou  who  findest  felicity  in  the  company  of  the 
Gods  and  Gandharvas  and  who  takest  delight  in  warfare,  I  am 
resolved  to  descend  into  Rasatala  for  the  purpose  of  conquest 
and,  having  triumphed  over  the  Three  Worlds  and  placed  the

Serpent  Race  and  the  Gods  under  my  yoke,  I  shall  chum  up  the 
ocean  containing  the  Nectar  of  Immortality.' 

"  Thereafter,  the  blessed  Rishi  Narada  asked  Dashagriva  : — 

"  '  Why  therefore  dost  thou  remain  here  engaged  in  another 
path  ?  Assuredly  the  way  that  leads  to  the  City  of  Yama,  the 
King  of  the  Dead,  is  extremely  hard,  O  Invincible  Hero,  O 
Scourge  of  thy  Foes.* 

"Thereat,  bursting  into  laughter,  like  unto  the  crash  of 
thunder  in  autumn,  Dashanana  cried  out:  — 

"  *  Verily  it  is  accomplished  ! '  Then  he  added,  *  Resolved  to 
slay  Vaivasvata,  O  Great  Brahmin,  I  shall  go  to  the  southern 
region,  where  that  king,  born  of  Surya,  dwells.  Truly,  O  Most 
Blessed  One,  in  mine  anger  and  martial  ardour,  I  swear  I  shall 
overcome  the  four  Guardians  of  the  World  !  Here  am  I,  ready 
to  march  against  the  city  of  the  King  of  the  Pitris.  I  shall 
compass  the  end  of  Mrityu,  he  who  plunges  all  beings  into 
mourning.' 

"  Having  spoken  thus  to  the  Muni  and  taken  leave  of  him, 
Dashagriva  went  away  and  entered  the  southern  region  accom- 
panied by  his  ministers. 

"  Narada  however,  filled  with  brahmanic  ardour  stood 
awhile  plunged  in  thought  and,  as  he  pondered,  that  Indra  among 
ascetics  resembled  a  smokeless  fire. 

"  He  reflected : — *  How  can  death  be  overcome,  he  who 
afflicts  the  Three  Worlds  with  their  rulers  and  all  animate  and 
inanimate  beings,  visiting  them  with  just  retribution  at  the 
termination  of  their  lives  ?  He,  the  witness  of  their  offerings 
and  sacrifices,  like  unto  a  second  Pavaka ;  he,  whose  power 
energises  the  worlds  when  beings  attaining  consciousness  put 
forth  their  activity,  and  in  fear  of  whom  the  Three  Worlds  are 
disturbed.  He  before  whom  the  Three  Worlds  flee  in  terror, 
how  dare  that  foremost  of  Rakshasas  stand  before  him  ?  He 
who  is  Vidhatar  and  Dhatar,  the  distributor  of  rewards  and 
punishments  in  accordance  with  men's  deeds;  he  the  con- 
queror of  the  Three  Worlds,  how  can  Ravana  overcome  him  ? 
And  if  he  does  subdue  him,  what  other  order  will  he  establish  ? 
Curiosity  urges  me  to  descend  into  Yama's  abode  in  order  to 
witness  the  duel  between  Yama  and  that  Rakshasa  in  person.' "

Ravana  goes  to  the  Nether  Regions  to  challenge  Yama 

"  Reflecting  thus,  the  foremost  of  the  ascetics  departed  with  a 
light  step  for  Yama's  abode  in  order  to  acquaint  him  with  what 
had  taken  place  and  there  he  found  the  God  Yama  before  a  fire, 
dealing  out  justice  to  every  being  according  to  his  deserts. 

"  Then  Yama,  becoming  aware  of  the  presence  of  that  great 
Rishi  Narada,  offering  him  a  comfortable  seat  and  the  Arghya, 
according  to  tradition,  said  to  him  : — 

"  *  O  Devarishi,  is  all  well  or  is  righteousness  in  jeopardy  ? 
Wherefore  hast  thou  come  hither,  thou  who  art  revered  by  the 
Gods  and  Gandharvas  ?  * 

"  Thereupon  Narada,  that  blessed  Rishi,  answered  him 
saying: — 

"  *  Hear  what  I  have  to  tell  thee  and  do  what  thou  considerest 
fitting  !  That  ranger  of  the  night,  named  Dashagriva,  is  coming 
here  to  overthrow  thee  by  the  force  of  his  will,  though  thou  art 
invincible.  It  is  on  this  account  that  I  have  come  hither  in  all 
haste,  fearing  what  would  befall  thee,  O  Lord  Who  bearest  the 
Rod.*1 

"At  that  instant,  they  beheld  the  Rakshasa's  chariot,  bright  as 
the  sun,  approaching  in  the  distance  ;  and  the  mighty  Dasha- 
griva  advancing  in  the  dazzling  Pushpaka  Car  dispelled  the 
darkness  of  the  region  of  death. 

"  On  all  sides  that  long-armed  hero  beheld  those  who  were 
eating  the  fruit  of  their  good  and  evil  acts  and  he  observed  the 
soldiers  of  Yama  and  his  attendants,  ferocious  beings  of  formid- 
able and  hideous  aspect.  He  saw  those  undergoing  torment 
emitting  loud  cries,  giving  themselves  up  to  bitter  lamentations, 
devoured  by  worms  and  fierce  dogs,  uttering  shrieks  that  rent 
the  ears,  filling  all  with  terror ;  and  those  who  were  crossing  the 
Vaitarani  River,  which  flowed  with  blood,  sinking  at  each  step 
into  the  burning  sands  which  scorched  them ;  and  malefactors

being  cut  to  pieces  in  the  Asipatra  Wood1  or  plunged  in  the 
Raurava  region8  or  the  Ksharanadi8  or  slashed  with  Kshurad- 
haras4,  crying  out  for  water,  tortured  by  hunger  and  thirst, 
emaciated,  afflicted,  pale,  their  hair  in  disarray,  besmeared  with 
mud  and  filth,  stricken  and  demented,  running  hither  and 
thither.  And  Ravana  beheld  them  in  hundreds  and  thousands 
on  the  way,  and  he  saw  others  in  palaces,  where  songs  and 
musical  instruments  could  be  heard,  disporting  themselves  as 
the  result  of  their  good  deeds.  And  milk  was  supplied  to  those 
who  had  given  kine  in  charity  and  rice  to  those  who  had  distribu- 
ted rice,  and  dwellings  to  those  who  had  bestowed  dwellings  on 
others;  each  reaping  the  fruit  of  his  own  deeds.  Others  among 
the  virtuous  were  surrounded  by  youthful  women  adorned  with 
gold,  precious  gems  and  magnificent  pearls,  resplendent  in  their 
own  radiance ;  all  these  appeared  to  the  long-armed  Ravana, 
Lord  of  the  Rakshasas. 

"  Then  those  who  were  in  torment  as  a  punishment  for  their 
evil  deeds,  were  audaciously  liberated  by  the  Rakshasa  who  was 
powerful  and  valiant,  and  those  phantoms,  suddenly  receiving 
that  unexpected  clemency,  set  free  by  that  mighty  monarch, 
rushed  upon  him,  and  a  great  clamour  arose,  whereupon  the 
soldiers  belonging  to  Dharmaraja,  who  were  full  of  courage,  ran 
to  that  spot. 

"Armed  with  arrows,  iron  bars,  spears,  maces,  lances  and 
picks  in  their  hundreds  and  thousands,  they  attacked  the 
Pushpaka  Car  bravely.  Seats,  upper  galleries,  floors  and  arches 
were  rapidly  demolished  by  those  warriors  who  fell  upon  it  like  a 
swarm  of  bees ;  but  the  celestial  aerial  car,  though  broken,  was 
indestructible  and  resumed  its  former  shape  through  Brahma's 
power.  That  great  army  of  the  magnanimous  Yama  was  not  to 
be  counted  and  the  advance  guard  alone  numbered  a  hundred 
thousand  warriors. 

"Trees,  rocks,  missiles  in  their  hundreds  were  thrown  in 
profusion  with  all  their  strength  by  those  valiant  followers  of 
Dashanana  and  by  the  king  himself.  Although  their  limbs  were 
covered  with  blood  and  lacerated  by  every  kind  of  missile,  the

ministers  of  the  foremost  of  the  titans  fought  like  giants  and  the 
foremost  of  warriors,  the  intrepid  soldiers  of  Yama  and  Ravana's 
followers  struck  each  other  with  redoubled  blows,  O  Prince. 
Thereafter,  leaving  their  adversaries,  Yama's  forces  rushed  on 
Dashanana  with  their  spears,  and  the  King  of  the  Rakshasas,  his 
body  streaming  with  blood,  shone  like  an  Ashoka  Tree  in 
flower. 

"  Meantime,  spears,  maces,  javelins,  lances,  darts,  arrows, 
rocks  and  trees  poured  from  the  mighty  bow  of  that  courageous 
warrior.  A  formidable  shower  of  trees,  stones  and  weapons  of 
all  sorts  fell  on  the  forces  of  Yama  and  thereafter  on  the  earth. 

"  Having  severed  all  those  missiles  and  repelled  that  hail  of 
projectiles,  the  soldiers  of  Yama  struck  that  redoubtable  titan, 
who  fought  single-handed  against  hundreds  and  thousands  and 
they  all  surrounded  him  like  a  mass  of  clouds  round  a  mountain 
and,  with  their  Bhindipalas  and  their  spears,  they  assailed  him 
with  such  force  that  he  could  scarcely  breathe.  His  coat  of  mail 
severed,  cut  to  pieces  midst  rivers  of  blood  flowing  from  his 
person,  full  of  rage,  he  abandoned  Pushpaka  and  leapt  to  the 
earth.  Furnished  with  his  bow  and  arrows,  he  expanded  in 
energy  in  the  combat  and  speedily  regaining  his  senses,  full  of 
fury,  he  stood  there  like  a  second  Antaka.  Placing  the  celestial 
shaft,  Pashupata1  on  his  bow  and  bending  it,  he  cried  '  Stay  ! 
Stay !  *  and,  stretching  the  cord  up  to  his  ear,  he  loosed  that 
missile  in  the  fight,  as  Shankara  when  attacking  Tripura. 

"And  that  dan  with  its  circle  of  fire  and  smoke  resembled  a 
blazing  fire  that,  growing,  consumes  a  forest  during  the  summer 
season.  With  its  crown  of  flames,  that  shaft,  loosed  by  that 
eater  of  flesh,  ranged  the  field  of  battle  freely,  reducing  the 
bushes  and  trees  to  ashes.  Then  the  soldiers  of  Vaivasvata  fell 
like  the  standards  of  the  Great  God  Indra,  consumed  by  the 
violence  of  the  blaze,  and  that  Rakshasa  of  formidable  prowess, 
with  his  companions  uttered  a  great  roar  which  convulsed  the 
earth.**

CHAPTER    22 

The  Duel  between  Ravana  and  Yama ;  Brahma  intervenes 

"  Hearing  that  great  tumult,  the  Lord  Vaivasvata  realised  his 
enemy  had  triumphed  and  that  his  army  was  destroyed. 
Knowing  his  forces  were  slain,  his  eyes  red  with  anger,  he 
addressed  his  charioteer,  saying : — 

"  '  Take  my  chariot  there  speedily !  * 

"  Thereupon  the  driver  brought  the  vast  celestial  car  of  his 
most  powerful  master  and  that  exceedingly  energetic  one  ascen- 
ded it.  And  Mrityu,  the  destroyer  of  the  Triple  World  of 
perpetual  change,  with  a  lance  and  mallet  in  his  hand  and  Time 
as  his  Rod,  stood  at  Yama's  side ;  and  that  divine  weapon 
blazed  like  fire. 

"  Beholding  Kala1  highly  enraged,  inspiring  terror  in  the 
whole  universe,  the  Three  Worlds  were  agitated  and  the 
inhabitants  of  heaven  were  seized  with  fear.  Thereafter  the 
charioteer  urged  on  his  steeds  that  were  the  colour  of  blood,  and 
drove  his  thundering  chariot  to  meet  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas ; 
and,  in  an  instant,  his  horses,  the  equals  of  those  belonging  to 
Hari,  carried  Yama  with  the  speed  of  thought  to  the  scene  of 
the  combat. 

"  Seeing  that  terrible  chariot  that  Mrityu  accompanied,  the 
followers  of  the  foremost  of  the  Rakshasas  took  to  their  heels, 
saying : — 

"  *  It  is  impossible  for  us  to  contend  with  him  J '  In  their 
cowardice,  beside  themselves  with  terror,  they  fled  away, 
Dashagriva,  however,  in  the  presence  of  that  chariot  that  spread 
terror  in  the  Universe,  remained  unmoved  and  experienced  no 
fear. 

"  Coming  within  range  of  his  adversary,  Yama,  in  fury,  loosed 
arrows  and  darts  piercing  Ravana's  vital  parts  but  he,  master  of 
himself,  let  fly  a  hail  of  shafts  on  Yama's  chariot,  as  a  cloud  lets 
fall  its  waters,  and  though  the  Rakshasa  was  unable  to  repel  those

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

great  shafts  that  fell  in  hundreds  on  his  mighty  breast,  yet  he 
experienced  no  ill  effect ;  nevertheless,  after  a  fight  lasting  seven 
days,  and  all  those  missiles  of  various  kinds  that  Yama,  the 
Scourge  of  his  Foes,  loosed  upon  him,  Ravana,  averting  his  face, 
became  distraught  and  a  terrible  struggle  ensued  between  Yama 
and  the  Rakshasa,  each  eager  to  triumph  and  neither  turning 
back  in  the  fight. 

"At  that  time,  Devas,  Gandharvas,  Siddhas  and  great  Rishis 
with  Prajapati  at  their  head,  assembled  on  the  field  of  battle,  for 
the  duel  taking  place  between  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas  and  the 
King  of  the  Dead  appeared  like  the  dissolution  of  the  worlds. 

"  Ravana,  stretching  his  bow,  like  unto  Indra's  thunderbolt, 
filled  the  whole  of  space  with  his  shafts  and  he  struck  Mrityu 
with  four  barbed  arrows  and  his  driver  with  seven,  thereafter 
with  his  swift  arrows  piercing  Yama  in  his  vital  parts  a  hundred 
thousand  times. 

"  Then,  from  the  mouth  of  the  enraged  Yama,  a  circle  of  flame 
issued,  accompanied  by  wind  and  smoke,  verily  a  fire  of  wrath. 
Beholding  that  marvel  in  the  presence  of  Gods  and  Danavas, 
both  Mrityu  and  Kala  were  transported  with  rage  and  Mrityu, 
in  a  paroxysm  of  anger,  said  to  Vaivasvata : — '  Suffer  me  to 
destroy  this  wicked  Rakshasa  !  This  very  day,  in  accord  with 
the  natural  law,  this  Rakshasa  shall  cease  to  be  !  Hiranya- 
kashipu,  the  fortunate  Namuchi,  Shambara,  Nishandi,  Dhuma- 
ketu,  Bali,  Virochana,  the  Giant  Shambhu,  mighty  monarchs, 
Vritra  and  Bana,  the  Rajarishis  versed  in  the  Shastras,  Punnagas, 
Daityas,  Yakshas  and  troops  of  Apsaras,  with  the  earth  and  its 
mountains,  rivers  and  trees  and  the  great  ocean,  have  all  been 
destroyed  by  me  at  the  end  of  the  World  cycle,  O  Great  King. 
Those  beings  and  others  in  great  numbers,  who  were  powerful 
and  invincible,  have  been  annihilated  by  my  glance,  how  much 
more  easilj  can  I  bring  about  the  death  of  this  ranger  of  the  night? 
Let  me  go  therefore,  O  Virtuous  Lord,  that  I  may  destroy  him  ! 
No  creature,  however  powerful  he  may  be,  can  survive  if  my 
glance  falls  upon  him.  This  power  is  not  mine  own ;  it  is  a 
natural  law  that  on  whosoever  I  cast  my  glance,  O  Kala,  he  does 
not  live  even  for  an  instant.' 

"  Thus  spoke  Mrityu  and  the  illustrious  Lord  of  Justice 
answered : — 

434 


UTTARA    KANDA 

"  '  Calm  thyself  I  shall  slay  him ! '  Then  the  Lord  Vaivas- 
vata, his  eyes  red  with  anger,  lifted  up  the  Rod  of  Death  that 
never  misses  its  target,  that  Rod  to  the  sides  of  which  the  snares 
of  destruction  are  attached,  and  he  seized  hold  of  a  hammer  like 
unto  a  flash  of  lightning,  which,  by  its  aspect  alone,  extinguishes 
the  breath  of  living  beings,  how  much  more  when  it  falls  on 
them !  That  weapon  surrounded  by  flames,  that  huge  mace, 
that  seemed  to  consume  the  Rakshasa,  emitted  sparks  when  that 
mighty  being  took  hold  of  it.  Then,  as  the  God  prepared  to 
smite  Ravana,  the  Grandsire  of  the  World  appeared  suddenly 
and  said: — 

"  *  O  Great-armed  Vaivasvata,  O  Thou,  whose  courage  is 
immeasurable,  know  that  thou  must  not  strike  the  ranger  of  the 
night  with  thy  Rod.  I  have  bestowed  a  boon  on  him,  O  King 
of  the  Gods,  thou  must  not  render  it  void  for  I  have  pledged  my 
word  I  Verily  he  who  makes  me  appear  as  a  deceiver,  whether 
he  be  God  or  a  mere  mortal,  renders  the  Triple  World  guilty  of 
deceit !  That  terrible  weapon,  if  loosed  in  anger,  will  strike 
down  all  beings,  irrespective  if  they  are  dear  to  me  or  no. 
Inevitable  destruction  and  death  to  all  follows  on  that  Rod  of 
Death  of  immeasurable  splendour  created  by  me  !  Undoubtedly, 
O  My  Friend,  thou  shoiildst  not  let  it  fall  on  Ravana's  head,  for 
once  it  falls,  none  will  survive  even  for  an  instant.  Should  it 
fall  on  the  Rakshasa  Dasbagriva,  whether  he  die  or  does  not  die, 
either  way,  deceit  will  have  been  practised !  Therefore  turn 
aside  that  uplifted  Rod  from  the  King  of  Lanka  and  confirm  my 
good  faith  in  deference  to  the  worlds !  * 

"Thus  addressed,  the  virtuous  Lord  of  Death,  Yama 
answered : — 

" '  I  shall  restrain  the  Rod  as  thou  art  our  Master,  but,  as  I 
may  not  slay  mine  adversary  who  is  protected  by  thy  boon,  what 
shall  I  do  now  in  the  fight?  I  shall  render  myself  invisible  to  the 
Rakshasa  1 ' 

"  So  speaking,  he  vanished  with  his  chariot  and  horses. 

"  Thereafter,  Dashagriva,  master  of  the  field,  proclaimed  his 
name  and,  re-mounting  Pushpaka,  emerged  from  Yama's  abode. 
Vaivasvata,  however,  with  the  Gods,  preceded  by  Brahma, 
joyfully  returned  to  the  Celestial  Region,  as  did  the  great  Muni 
Narada  also."

CHAPTER    23 

Ravana1  s  Struggle  with  the  Sorts  of  Varuna 

"  Having  overcome  Yama  the  foremost  of  the  Gods,  the  Ten- 
necked  Ravana,  proud  warrior,  went  to  seek  out  his  followers. 
Beholding  him  with  his  limbs  covered  with  blood,  riddled  with 
wounds,  they  were  amazed.  With  Maricha  at  their  head,  they 
offered  felicitations  to  him  on  his  victory  and  re-assured  by  him, 
they  all  took  their  places  in  the  Pushpaka  Chariot.  Thereafter 
the  Rakshasa  descended  into  the  watery  region1  inhabited  by 
Daityas  and  Uragas  under  the  powerful  protection  of  Varuna. 
From  there  he  went  to  the  Capital  Bhogavati,  where  Vasuki 
reigns,  and,  having  subjugated  the  Nagas,  he  joyfully  entered 
the  city  made  of  precious  stones.  There  the  Nivatakavachas2, 
Daityas  protected  by  Brahma  dwelt,  and  the  Rakshasa,  approach- 
ing them,  challenged  them  to  fight.  Instantly  those  intrepid 
Daityas,  full  of  valour,  armed  with  every  weapon  in  their 
martial  ardour,  rushed  out  joyfully. 

"  Then  the  Rakshasas  and  Danavas  struck  each  other  furiously 
with  spears,  tridents,  Kalishas,  harpoons,  swords  and  Parash- 
vadhas  and,  while  they  fought  thus,  a  whole  year  passed  away 
without  either  side  being  victorious  or  suffering  defeat. 

"At  the  end  of  that  time,  the  Grandsire,  Lord  of  the  Three 
Worlds,  the  imperishable  God,  appeared  in  his  marvellous 
chariot  and,  in  order  to  bring  the  bellicose  activities  of  the 
Nivatakavachas  to  a  close,  that  Ancient  One  made  known  to 
them  the  purpose  of  his  intervention,  saying  : — 

"  '  Ravana  cannot  be  overcome  in  battle  by  the  Gods  or  Asuras 
and  you  yourselves  cannot  be  destroyed  even  by  the  Immortals 
and  Danavas  together.  It  would  find  favour  with  me,  if  the 
Rakshasas  were  joined  with  you  in  friendship ;  undoubtedly  all 
benefits  are  shared  by  friends.'

UTTARA    KANDA 

"  Thereupon,  in  the  presence  of  fire,  Ravana  concluded  an 
alliance  with  the  Nivatakavachas  and  became  their  friend. 

"  Honoured  by  them  according  to  tradition,  he  sojourned  in 
that  place  for  a  year,  where  he  passed  his  time  exactly  as  in  his 
own  city.  There,  having  studied  a  hundred  forms  of  magic  he 
became  proficient  in  one,  then  he  set  out  to  explore  Rasatala 
in  order  to  discover  the  capital  of  the  Lord  of  the  Waters, 
Varuna.  Reaching  the  Gty  of  Ashma,  he  slew  all  the  in- 
habitants and,  with  bis  sword,  pierced  his  powerful  brother-in- 
law,  Vidyuj  jihva,  the  consort  of  Shurpanakha,  who  was  proud  of 
his  strength  and  who,  with  his  tongue,  was  licking  a  Rakshasa, 
preparatory  to  devouring  him.  Having  slain  him,  Ravana 
thereafter,  in  an  instant,  destroyed  four  hundred  Daityas.  It 
was  then  that  the  celestial  abode  of  Varuna,  resembling  a  cloud, 
dazzling  as  Mount  Kailasha,  appeared  to  that  monarch,  and 
he  beheld  there  the  Cow,  Surabha,  from  whom  milk  ever  flows 
which  forms  the  Ocean  Kshiroda. 

"  Ravana  saw  Vararani,  Mother  of  cows  and  bulls  also,  from 
whom  is  born  Chandra  of  cooling  rays,  who  ushers  in  the  night, 
taking  refuge  under  whom,  the  great  Rishis  subsist  on  the  froth 
of  that  milk  from  which  the  Nectar  of  Immortality,  the  food  of 
the  Gods  sprang,  as  also  Svadha,  the  food  of  the  Piths.  Having 
circumambulated  that  wonderful  Cow,  known  to  men  as 
Surabha,  Ravana  penetrated  into  a  formidable  region  defended 
by  troops  of  every  kind.  It  was  then  he  beheld  the  splendid 
residence  of  Varuna,  abounding  in  hundreds  of  cataracts, 
ever  wearing  a  delightful  aspect  and  resembling  an  autumn 
cloud. 

"  Having  struck  down  the  leaders  of  the  army  in  battle,  whom 
he  riddled  with  blows,  Ravana  said  to  those  warriors  : — *  Speedily 
inform  the  King  that  Ravana  has  come  hither  seeking  battle, 
saying  "Accept  this  challenge  if  thou  art  not  afraid,  otherwise, 
paying  obeisance  to  him  declare,  *  I  am  defeated  !  *  **  * 

"  Meantime,  the  sons  and  grandsons  of  the  magnanimous 
Varuna,  provoked,  set  out  with.  Go  and  Pushkara.1 

"  Those  valiant  beings,  surrounded  by  their  troops,  harnessed 
their  chariots  that  coursed  wheresoever  they  desired  and  shone 
like  the  rising  sun.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Thereafter  a  terrible  struggle  ensued,  causing  the  bair  to 
stand  on  end,  between  the  children  of  the  Lord  of  the  Waters 
and  the  crafty  Ravana.  The  brave  companions  of  the  Rakshasa 
Dashagriva,  in  an  instant,  destroyed  Varuna's  entire  army. 

"  Seeing  their  army  struck  down  in  the  fight,  the  sons  of 
Varuna,  overwhelmed  by  a  hail  of  missiles,  broke  off  the  conflict 
and,  as  they  were  escaping  underground,  they  beheld  Ravana  in 
the  Pushpaka  Chariot  and  hurled  themselves  into  the  sky  in  their 
fleet  cars.  Having  attained  an  equally  advantageous  position,  a 
desperate  fight  broke  out  afresh  and  a  terrible  conflict  arose  in  the 
air  like  unto  that  between  the  Gods  and  the  Danavas.  With  their 
shafts,  like  unto  Pavaka's,  they  put  Ravana  to  flight  and,  in  their 
joy,  emitted  countless  shouts  of  triumph. 

"  Then  Mahodara,  provoked,  on  seeing  Ravana  thus  sore 
pressed,  banished  all  fear  of  death  and,  in  his  martial  ardour, 
casting  infuriated  glances  round  about,  with  his  mace  struck 
the  chariots  that  were  coursing  at  will  with  the  speed  of  the 
wind,  causing  them  to  fall  on  the  earth.  Having  slain  the 
soldiers  and  destroyed  the  chariots  of  Varuna's  sons,  Mahodara, 
seeing  them  deprived  of  their  cars,  emitted  a  loud  shout.  The 
chariots  with  their  steeds  and  their  excellent  drivers,  destroyed 
by  Mahodara,  lay  on  the  earth  and,  though  bereft  of  their 
vehicles,  the  sons  of  the  magnanimous  Varuna,  by  virtue  of  their 
natural  prowess,  remained  courageously  in  the  sky  without 
being  perturbed.  Stretching  their  bows,  they  pierced  Mahodara 
and,  gathering  together,  they  surrounded  Ravana  on  the  battle- 
field and,  with  their  formidable  shafts,  like  unto  thunderbolts 
loosed  from  their  bows,  they  overwhelmed  him  in  their  rage,  as 
clouds  rain  down  on  a  great  mountain. 

"  On  his  side,  the  irascible  Dashagriva,  like  unto  the  fire  of 
dissolution,  showered  down  a  fearful  hail  of  missiles  on  their 
vital  parts  with  irresistible  and  uninterrupted  force,  and  there 
were  maces  of  every  kind,  Bhallas  in  their  hundreds,  harpoons, 
lances  and  huge  Shataghnis.  Then  Varuna's  sons,  reduced  to 
walking  on  foot,  saw  themselves  restricted  like  unto  sixty-year 
old  elephants  who  have  entered  a  great  morass  and,  beholding 
the  sons  of  Varuna  thus  stricken  and  exhausted,  the  supremely 
powerful  Ravana  emitted  shouts  of  joy  like  unto  an  immense 
cloud,  and  letting  forth  those  loud  roars,  he  struck  Varuna's 
438 


UTTARA    KANDA 

offspring  with  shafts  of  every  kind  which  he  showered  down  upon 
them  like  a  cloud. 

"  Thereupon  they  turned  back  and  fell  headlong  to  the  ground 
and  their  followers  carried  them  hastily  from  the  battlefield  to 
their  homes,  whilst  the  Rakshasa  cried  out  '  Carry  the  tidings 
to  Varuna  1 ' 

"  Thereafter  one  of  Varuna's  counsellors,  named  Prahasta, 
answered  him  saying  : — 

" '  Varuna,  the  Lord  of  the  Waters,  that  mighty  monarch, 
whom  thou  art  challenging  to  combat,  has  gone  to  Brahmaloka 
to  hear  the  Gandharra  music.  Why  exhaust  thyself  in  vain,  O 
Hero,  since  the  King  is  not  here  ?  * 

"  Then  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  having  heard  this,  pro- 
claimed his  name  and  emitted  joyful  cries ;  thereafter,  issuing 
out  of  Varuna's  abode  and  returning  from  whence  he  had  come, 
Ravana  ascended  into  the  sky  and  directed  his  course  to  Lanka."

"  Thereafter  Ravana's  war-intoxicated  followers  ranged  the 
City  of  Ashma  and  Dashanana  beheld  there  a  great  palace,  the 
archways  of  which  were  set  with  emeralds  and  adorned  with  a 
network  of  pearls.  Abounding  in  golden  pillars  and  sacred 
altars,  the  stairways,  made  of  gold,  were  studded  with  diamonds 
and  hung  with  small  bells  and  delightful  seats  placed  here  and 
there,  so  that  it  resembled  the  palace  of  Mahendra. 

"  Beholding  that  beautiful  dwelling,  the  supremely  powerful 
Ravana  reflected  within  himself: — 'Whose  is  this  marvellous 
mansion  like  unto  the  peak  of  Mount  Meru  ?  Go,  O  Prahasta 
and  ascertain  speedily  to  whom  this  residence  belongs  ! ' 

"Thereupon  Prahasta  entered  that  excellent  abode  and, 
finding  no  one  in  the  first  apartment,  he  went  to  another, 
439 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

penetrating  into  seven  rooms  till  at  last  he  observed  a  fire 
burning,  in  the  flames  of  which  he  beheld  a  man  seated,  laughing 
aloud ;  and,  hearing  that  dreadful  laughter,  Prahasta's  hair 
stood  on  end.  The  man  thus  seated  as  if  unconscious  in  the 
fire,  blinding  to  look  upon  as  the  sun  and  like  unto  Yama 
himself,  was  wearing  a  golden  chain.  Beholding  this,  that  night- 
ranger  speedily  left  the  house  and  communicated  all  to 
Havana. 

"  O  Rama,  Dashagriva,  resembling  a  piece  of  collyrium, 
alighting  from  Pushpaka,  sought  to  enter  that  dwelling  but  a 
huge-bodied  person,  moon-crested,  barred  the  door.  His 
tongue  resembled  a  name,  bis  eyes  were  red,  his  teeth  dazzling, 
his  lips  like  die  Bimba  Fruit,  his  nose  dreadful  and  he  was 
handsome  of  form  with  a  neck  curved  like  a  conch,  marked  with 
three  lines,  bis  jaws  enormous,  his  beard  thick,  his  bones  well 
covered  with  flesh,  possessing  large  fangs,  his  whole  aspect 
terrible,  causing  the  hair  to  stand  on  end ;  and  he  held  a  mace 
in  bis  hand  as  he  stood  at  the  door;  then  as  Ravana  beheld  him, 
his  hair  rose  on  end,  his  heart  beat  furiously  and  bis  body 
trembled. 

"  Perceiving  these  inauspicious  omens,  Ravana  began  to 
ponder  within  himself  and  while  he  was  reflecting  thus,  that 
Being  addressed  him,  saying  : — 

"  *  Of  what  art  thou  thinking,  O  Rakshasa  ?  Tell  me  without 
fear !  I  shall  confer  the  pleasure  of  combat  on  thee,  O  Hero,  O 
Night-ranger ! ' 

"  Thereafter  he  spoke  again  to  Ravana,  saying : — 

" '  Dost  thou  desire  to  enter  into  conflict  with  Bali  or  hast 
thou  some  other  intention  ?  ' 

"  Hearing  these  words,  Ravana  was  overwhelmed  with  fear  so 
that  his  hair  stood  on  end  but,  recollecting  himself,  he  answered:- 

" '  O  Thou,  the  foremost  of  those  skilled  in  speech,  who 
resideth  in  this  mansion?  I  would  enter  into  combat  with  him  if 
thou  counsellest  me  to  do  so !  * 

"  Then  that  Being  answered  him,  saying : — 

"  *  The  Lord  of  the  Danavas  lives  here ;  he  is  supremely 

magnanimous,  valiant,  possessing  truth  for  his  prowess,  endowed 

with  many  qualities,  resplendent,  like  unto  Yama  bearing  a 

noose  in  his  hand,  bright  as  the  rising  sun,  incapable  of  being

UTTARA    KANDA 

defeated  in  combat,  impetuous,  invincible,  victorious,  a  veritable 
ocean  of  accomplishments,  soft-spoken,  the  support  of  those  who 
depend  on  him,  devoted  to  his  preceptor  and  the  brahmins, 
conversant  with  the  proper  time  (for  executing  actions),  gifted 
with  great  powers,  truthful,  handsome,  skilful,  heroic,  ever 
engaged  in  the  study  of  the  Veda ;  though  walking  on  foot,  he 
moves  like  the  wind,  he  shines  like  fire,  radiating  heat  like  the 
sun,  he  stands  in  awe  of  neither  Gods,  spirits,  snakes  nor  birds, 
fear  is  unknown  to  him.  Dost  thou  wish  to  fight  with  Bali,  O 
Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  O  Thou  gifted  with  supreme  energy  ? 
Then  enter  this  abode  speedily  and  engage  in  the  encounter  ! ' 
"  Being  thus  addressed,  the  Ten-necked  Titan  went  in  to 
where  Bali  was,  and  that  foremost  of  the  Danavas,  who  resembled 
a  Same  of  fire  and  was  as  hard  to  gaze  upon  as  the  sun,  beholding 
the  Lord  of  Lanka,  burst  into  laughter  and,  taking  the  Rakshasa 
by  the  hand  placed  him  on  his  lap,  saying : — 

" '  O  Ten-necked  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  O  Long-armed  One, 
what  desire  of  thine  shall  I  gratify  ?    Say  what  has  brought  thee 
hither?* 
"  Being  thus  addressed  by  Bali,  Ravana  answered  : — 
"  *  O  Illustrious  One,  I  have  heard  that  formerly  thou  wert 
imprisoned  by  Vishnu,  verily  I  have  the  power  to  release  thee 
from  these  bonds  ! ' 
"  Hearing  these  words  of  Ravana,  Bali  laughed  and  said : — 
"  '  Hear  and  I  will  tell  thee,  O  Ravana !   The  Dark-hued  One 
Who  stands  at  the  door,  formerly  subdued  all  the  Danavas  and 
other  powerful  Lords  and  I  also  was  imprisoned  by  Him.    He  is 
as  invincible  as  Death ;  none  in  the  world  can  delude  Him.    He, 
Who  stands  at  the  entrance,  is  the  Destroyer,  Creator  and 
Preserver,  Lord  of  the  Three  Worlds.    Neither  thou  nor  I  know 
Him ;  He  is  the  Lord  of  the  past,  present  and  future,  He  is 
Time,  He  is  the  Kali  Yuga,  He  overthrows  all  beings  ;  He  is  the 
Creator  and  Destroyer  of  the  Three  Worlds  and  of  all  animate 
and  inanimate  things ;  that  great  God  of  all  Gods  creates  and 
re-creates  the  universe  again  and  again  for  ever.    O  Night- 
ranger,  He  is  the  Dispenser  of  the  fruits  of  sacrifices,  gifts  and 
oblations,  verily  He  is  the  Creator  and  Preserver  of  the  entire 
Universe,  there  is  none  in  the  Three  Worlds  comparable  with 
Him  in  majesty  and  glory.   O  Scion  of  the  House  of  Poulastya.

"  *  Vritra,  Danu,  Shuka,  Shambu,  Nishumbha,  Shumbha, 
Kalanemi,  Prahlada  and  others,  Kuta,  Virochana,  Mridu, 
Yamala,  Arjuna,  Kansa,  Kaitabha  and  Madhu  all  radiated  heat 
like  the  sun  and  were  as  resplendent  as  its  rays,  all  moved  like 
the  wind  and  showered  down  rain  like  unto  Indra,  all  celebrated 
sacrifices  and  underwent  severe  penances,  all  were  exalted  of 
soul  and  followers  of  the  Path  of  Yoga,  all  acquired  wealth  and 
enjoyed  many  pleasures,  all  distributed  gifts  abundantly, 
studied  the  Veda  and  protected  their  subjects,  all  were  defenders 
of  their  kinsfolk  and  slayers  of  their  foes ,  none  could  stand 
against  them  in  the  Three  Worlds  and  they  were  powerful, 
thoroughly  conversant  with  the  Shastras  and  all  branches  of 
learning  and  were  never  known  to  retreat  in  battle. 

"  '  They  ruled  the  kingdoms  of  the  Gods,  having  overcome 
them  a  thousand  times,  and  they  were  ever  engaged  in  harassing 
them  and  protecting  their  own  followers.  Inflated  with  pride 
and  arrogance,  given  to  attachment,  they  were  as  effulgent  as 
the  newly  risen  sun,  but  the  glorious  Hari,  the  Lord  Vishnu 
knows  how  to  bring  about  the  destruction  of  those  who  per- 
petually trouble  the  Gods.  He  creates  them  all  and  Himself 
constantly  brings  about  their  end  ;  existing  by  Himself  at  the 
time  of  dissolution. 

"  *  These  highly  powerful  and  illustrious  Danava  Chiefs,  able 
to  assume  any  form  at  will,  were  destroyed  by  that  glorious  God, 
and  further,  all  those  heroes,  said  to  be  invincible  and  irresistible 
in  warfare,  have  been  discomfited  by  the  wondrous  power  of 
Kritanta.*1 

"  Having  spoken  thus  to  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Danavas 
again  addressed  the  King  of  the  Rakshasas,  saying : — 

"  '  O  Hero,  O  Thou  gifted  with  great  strength,  take  up  this 
shining  disc  that  thou  seest  and  draw  near  to  my  side ;  I  shall 
then  tell  thee  how  I  have  broken  my  bonds  forever.  Do  what  I 
have  told  thee,  O  Long-armed  One,  delay  not  I  * 

"  O  Descendant  of  Raghu,  hearing  this,  the  highly  powerful 
Rakshasa,  laughing,  proceeded  to  where  that  celestial  disc  was. 
Proud  of  his  strength  he  deemed  himself  able  to  lift  it  with  ease 

1  Kritanta — The  incarnation  of  the  fence  of  destiny,  lit: '  Btinger  to  an  end  '.

UTTARA    KANDA 

but,  taking  hold  of  it,  he  could  not  move  it  by  any  means  and, 
being  ashamed,  that  highly  powerful  one  again  attempted  it  and 
barely  raising  it,  that  Rakshasa  immediately  fell  to  the  earth 
unconscious,  bathed  in  a  pool  of  blood,  like  unto  a  Sala  Tree 
that  has  been  felled. 

"  Meantime  the  counsellors  of  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  who 
were  in  the  Pushpaka  Chariot,  cried  out  loudly  *AIas  !  Alas  !  * 
and  thereafter,  the  Rakshasa,  regaining  his  senses,  rose  up,  his 
head  bowed  in  shame  and  Bali  said  to  him  : — 

"  *  Draw  near,  O  Foremost  of  the  Rakshasas,  and  listen  to  my 
words,  O  Hero !  This  disc  encrusted  with  gems,  which  thou 
didst  seek  to  lift,  was  an  ornament  for  the  ear  belonging  to  one  of 
my  forbears  and  has  remained  here  where  it  fell,  look  upon  it ! 

0  Thou,  endowed  with  great  strength,  the  other  fell  on  the 
summit  of  a  mountain  and,  besides  these  two,  his  crown  also  fell 
on  the  earth  before  an  altar  during  the  encounter.  Formerly 
neither  time,  death  nor  disease  could  overcome  mine  ancestor 
Hiranyakashipu,  nor  could  he  be  visited  by  death  during  the 
day,  at  dawn  or  dusk.  O  Foremost  of  the  Rakshasas,  neither  a 
dry  nor  a  wet  object  nor  any  weapon  could  encompass  his  end. 

"  *  It  came  about  that  he  entered  into  a  dreadful  quarrel  with 
Frahlada1  and  antagonism  having  grown  up  between  him  and 
the  defenceless  and  courageous  Prahlada,  the  Lord  appeared  in 
the  form  of  Nrsingha,  he  of  dreadful  aspect  who  was  the  cause 
of  terror  to  all  beings.  O  Foremost  of  the  Rakshasas,  that  awful 
Being,  casting  glances  here  and  there,  overwhelmed  the  Three 
Worlds  and,  taking  up  Hiranyakashipu  in  his  arms,  he  tore  his 
body  open  with  his  nails ;  that  same  Being,  the  supreme  and 
taintless  Vasudeva  stands  at  the  door  !  I  shall  now  tell  thee  of 
that  supreme  God,  do  thou  hear  me,  if  my  words  have  any 
significance  for  thee.  He  who  stands  at  the  door  has  subdued 
thousands  of  Indras  and  hundreds  and  thousands  of  great  Gods 
and  Rishis.* 

"  Hearing  these  words,  Ravana  said : — 

" '  I  have  beheld  Kritanta,  the  Lord  of  Spirits  and  Death 
Himself !  His  hair  is  formed  of  serpents  and  scorpions,  he  bears 
a  noose  in  his  hand,  his  tongue  is  like  unto  a  flame  of  fire  darting 
like  lightning,  his  jaws  dreadful,  his  eyes  red;  he  is  endowed  with 

1  Ptahlad&ais  son,  a  devotee  of  Vishnu.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

immense  speed  and  is  the  terror  of  all  beings,  like  unto  the  sun 
incapable  of  being  looked  upon.  Unconquerable  in  combat,  the 
chastiser  of  evil-doers,  yet  even  he  was  overcome  in  conflict,  nor 
did  I  experience  the  least  fear  of  him,  O  Lord  of  die  Danavas.  I 
do  not  know  this  person  (at  the  door),  it  behoveth  thee  to  tell  me 
who  he  is.' 

"  Hearing  these  words  of  Ravana,  Bali,  die  Son  of  Virochana, 
answered: — 

"  *  He  is  the  Lord  Hari,  Narayana,  the  Protector  of  the  Three 
Worlds.  He  is  Ananta,  Kapila,  Vishnu  and  die  highly  effulgent 
Nrsingha ;  He  is  Kratudhama  and  Sudhama  who  bears  the 
dreadful  mace  in  his  hands.  He  resembles  the  Twelve  Adityas, 
He  is  the  first  Man,  the  primeval  and  excellent  Purusha ;  He  is 
like  unto  a  dark  blue  cloud  and  is  the  first  Lord  of  the  Gods.  O 
Long-armed  One,  He  is  encircled  by  flame ;  He  is  the  supreme 
Yogi,  beloved  of  His  devotees ;  He  projected  the  universe, 
preserves  it  and  destroys  it,  assuming  the  form  of  Time  endowed 
with  great  power.  This  Hari,  bearing  the  discus  in  His  hand,  is 
the  sacrifice  and  is  worshipped  in  the  sacrifice,  He  is  the  one  great 
form  of  all  the  Gods,  all  beings,  all  worlds  and  all  knowledge ; 
He  is  Baladeva,  O  Mighty-armed  One,  the  Slayer  of  Warriors  ; 
He  has  the  eye  of  a  hero  and  is  the  eternal  Guru,  the  Father  of 
the  Three  Worlds.  All  Sages,  desirous  of  liberation,  meditate 
on  Him.  He  who  knows  Him  thus,  is  freed  from  sin ;  he,  who 
remembers,  adores  and  worships  Him,  attains  all.' 

"  Hearing  these  words  of  Bali,  the  highly  powerful  Ravana, 
his  eyes  red  with  anger,  went  out  with  uplifted  weapons. 

"  Beholding  him  thus  inflamed  with  fury,  the  Lord  Hari,  Who 
bore  a  club  in  His  hand,  reflected, '  In  deference  to  Brahma,  I 
shall  not  slay  this  sinner  yet,'1  and  making  himself  invisible,  He 
vanished. 

"  Then  Ravana,  not  beholding  that  Purusha  there,  rejoiced, 
and,  shouting  exultandy,  issued  out  of  Varuna's  abode  and 
departed  by  the  same  way  by  which  he  had  come," 


1  Since  Brahma  had  granted  him  the  boon  of  invulnerability.

Ravana  challenges  the  Sun  God 

"After  reflecting  awhile,  the  Lord  of  Lanka  went  to  the  Solar 
Region,  passing  the  night  on  the  enchanting  summit  of  Mount 
Sumeru.  Riding  in  the  Pushpaka  Chariot,  which  was  endowed 
with  the  speed  of  the  sun's  steeds,  he,  by  various  ways  advanced, 
and  beheld  the  glorious  and  resplendent  Sun,  the  purifier  of  all, 
adorned  with  golden  bracelets  and  crowned  with  a  halo  encrusted 
with  gems.  His  lovely  countenance  was  graced  with  a  pair  of 
brilliant  earrings,  his  person  embellished  with  Keyuras,1  golden 
ornaments  and  garlands  of  crimson  lotuses.  His  body  was 
annointed  with  red  sandalwood  and  he  was  blazing  with  a 
thousand  rays. 

"  Beholding  the  Sun,  foremost  of  the  Gods,  Surya,  that 
primeval  Deity  without  end  or  middle,  having  Uchhaisravas  as 
his  steed,  He  the  Witness  of  the  World,  Lord  of  the  Earth, 
Ravana  was  overwhelmed  by  His  rays  and  said  to  Prahasta : — 

"  '  O  Counsellor,  do  thou  go  at  my  behest  and  apprise  the  Sun 
of  mine  intention  saying,  '  Ravana  has  come  hither  to  challenge 
thee,  do  thou  fight  or  admit  defeat;  do  one  or  the  other  speedily  !' 

"  Hearing  these  words,  that  Rakshasa  advanced  towards  the 
sun  and  beheld  two  door-keepers  named  Fingala  and  Dandi  and, 
having  communicated  Ravana's  resolutions  to  them,  he  stood 
silent,  being  overpowered  by  the  sun*s  rays. 

"Approaching  the  Sun,  Dandi  related  the  matter  to  him  and, 
hearing  of  Ravana's  intention,  the  sagacious  Surya,  that  enemy 
of  the  night,  said  to  him : — 

" '  O  Dandi,  either  subdue  Ravana  or  say  to  him  "  I  have 
been  defeated,  do  as  thou  deemest  best !  " 

"At  this  command,  Dandi  approached  the  high-souled  Ravana 
and  informed  him  of  what  the  Sun  had  said. 

"  Hearing  DandTs  words,  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas  pro- 
claimed his  victory  by  a  roll  of  drums  and  went  away."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

THIRD   OF  THE   INTERPOLATED   CHAPTERS 
I St    SERIES 

Ravana's  Encounter  with,  the  King  Mandhata 

"  Having  passed  the  night  on  die  enchanting  summit  of  Mount 
Sumeru  and  deliberated  for  some  time,  the  mighty  Lord  of 
Lanka  went  to  the  region  of  the  moon.  There  be  beheld  one 
sprinkled  with  heavenly  unguents,  seated  in  his  chariot  attended 
by  Apsaras  and  being  embraced  by  them,  proceeding  on  his  way, 
worn  out  by  the  gratification  of  desire.  Seeing  such  a  person,  his 
curiosity  was  aroused  and,  observing  a  Rishi,  named  Parvata, 
there,  he  said  to  him  : — 

"  *  Thou  art  welcome,  O  Blessed  Sage,  verily  thou  hast  come 
at  a  fitting  moment !  Who  is  this  shameless  being  proceeding 
in  a  chariot  attended  by  Apsaras  ?  He  appears  to  be  unaware  of 
his  peril  ?  * 

"  Thus  addressed  by  Ravana,  the  Rishi  Parvata,  said  to  him : — 

"  '  O  Child,  O  Thou  girted  with  high  intelligence,  hear  me  and 
I  will  tell  thee  the  truth.  By  him  all  these  worlds  have  been 
subdued  and  Brahma  propitiated,  and  he  is  on  his  way  to  a 
blissful  place.  As  thou,  by  virtue  of  asceticism,  hast  conquered 
the  worlds,  O  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  so  has  he ;  and,  having 
drunk  the  Soma-juice  and  performed  many  pious  acts,  he  has 
set  forth  on  bis  journey.  O  Foremost  of  the  Rakshasas,  thou  art 
valiant  and  hast  truth  for  thy  prowess ;  the  mighty  are  never 
offended  by  the  virtuous  !  * 

"  Then  Ravana  beheld  a  large  and  excellent  car,  radiant  and 
effulgent,  from  which  the  sound  of  music  and  singing  issued  and 
he  said : — 

"  *  O  Great  Rishi,  who  is  that  person  endowed  with  radiance 
who  proceeds  surrounded  by  charming  singers,  dancing  girls  and 
Kinneras?' 

"  Hearing  these  words,  Parvata,  the  foremost  of  Sages,  again 
replied : — 

" '  He  is  a  hero,  a  mighty  warrior,  who  has  never  retreated  in 
battle.  Having  performed  innumerable  heroic  feats  in  combat 
446 


UTTARA    KANDA 

and  slain  many  adversaries,  he  has  received  countless  wounds 
and  finally  sacrificed  his  life  for  his  master.  Having  destroyed 
a  myriad  people  in  battle,  he  has  at  last  been  slain  by  his  enemies. 
He  is  now  to  be  a  guest  of  Indra  or,  it  may  be  that  he  is  going  to 
some  other  auspicious  region.  This  foremost  of  men  is  being 
entertained  by  singing  and  dancing.' 

"  Then  Ravana  enquired  once  more : — 

" '  Who  goeth  yonder  shining  like  tie  sun  ? ' 

"  Hearing  Ravana's  words,  Parvata  said  : — 

"  *  That  person,  resembling  the  full  moon,  adorned  with 
various  ornaments  and  robes,  O  Mighty  King,  whom  thou 
beholdest  in  a  great  chariot  accompanied  by  troops  of  Apsaras, 
has  distributed  much  gold,  therefore  he  proceedeth  in  supreme 
effulgence  in  a  swiftly  coursing  car.' 

"  Hearing  Parvata's  words,  Ravana  said  again : — 

"  *  O  Foremost  of  Rishis,  do  thou  tell  me  which  of  these  kings 
proceeding  here,  if  entreated,  will  grant  me  the  pleasure  of 
battle  ?  Verily  thou  art  my  father  ;  do  thou  point  out  to  me  such 
a  one,  O  Thou  conversant  with  piety.' 

"  Thus  addressed,  Parvata,  once  more  replied  to  Ravana, 
saying : — 

"  *  O  Great  King,  all  these  monarcbs  desire  heaven  not 
conflict,  but,  O  Mighty  One,  I  shall  indicate  to  thee  one  who  will 
enter  into  combat  with  thee. 

"  '  There  is  a  supremely  powerful  king,  the  Lord  of  the  Seven 
Islands,  well  known  by  the  name  of  Mandhata,  who  will  do 
battle  with  thee.' 

"  Hearing  these  words  of  Parvata,  Ravana  said : — 

" '  Do  thou  tell  me  where  this  king  doth  dwell,  O  Thou  of 
great  devotion,  I  shall  go  to  where  that  foremost  of  men  resides.' 

"  Hearing  Ravana's  words,  the  Sage  said  again  : — 

"  *  The  son  of  Yuvaneshwa,  having  conquered  the  world 
consisting  of  the  Seven  Islands,  from  sea  to  sea,  Mandhata,  the 
foremost  of  kings  is  coming  here.* 

"  Thereupon  the  long-armed  Ravana,  proud  of  the  boon 
conferred  upon  him  in  the  Three  Worlds,  beheld  the  heroic 
Mandhata,  the  Lord  of  Ayodhya  and  the  foremost  of  monarchs. 
The  Lord  of  the  Seven  Islands  was  proceeding  in  a  gilded  and 
decorated  car  resplendent  as  that  of  Mahendra,  radiant  in  his 
447 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

own  beauty,  sprinkled  with  celestial  unguents,  and  the  Ten- 
necked  One  said  to  him  : — '  Do  thou  give  me  battle  ! ' 
"  Being  thus  addressed,  he,  laughing,  said  to  Dashanana  : — 
"  '  If  thy  life  is  not  dear  to  thee,  then  enter  into  combat  with 
me,  O  Rakshasa  ! ' 
"  Hearing  these  words  of  Mandhata,  Ravana  said : — 
"  '  Ravana  has  experienced  no  harm  from  Varuna,  Kuvera  or 
Yama,  what  should  he  fear  from  a  mere  man  ?  ' 

"  Having  spoken  thus,  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas  issued 
orders  to  the  titans  who  were  invincible  in  battle,  whereupon, 
in  fury,  the  counsellors  of  the  wicked-souled  Rakshasa,  well 
skilled  in  the  art  of  warfare,  began  to  discharge  a  hail  of 
arrows. 

"  Then  the  mighty  monarch,  Mandhata,  with  golden  feathered 
shafts,  assailed  Prahasta,  Shuka,  Sarana,  Mahodara,  Vimpaksha, 
Akampana  and  other  generals,  and  Prahasta  covered  the  king 
with  arrows  but,  before  they  reached  him,  that  foremost  of  men 
shattered  them  to  pieces.  As  grass  is  consumed  by  fire  so  was 
that  host  of  Rakshasas  consumed  by  the  King  Mandhata  by 
means  of  hundreds  of  Bushundis,  Bhallas,  Bhindipalas  and 
Tomaras.1  As  Karttikeya  sundered  Mount  Krauncha  with  his 
shafts,  so  did  Mandhata,  full  of  rage,  pierce  Prahasta  with  five 
Tomaras  endowed  with  supreme  velocity  and,  brandishing  his 
mace,  resembling  Yama's,  again  and  again  he  struck  Havana's 
chariot  violently  and  that  club  resembling  lightning,  fell  with 
force  so  that  Ravana  was  thrown  down  like  unto  Shakra's  banner. 
Thereafter  the  joy  of  King  Mandhata  was  increased,  as  the 
waters  of  the  salty  ocean  at  the  time  of  the  full  moon,  but  the 
entire  Rakshasa  Host,  shrieking  with  terror,  stood  round  the 
unconscious  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas.  Speedily  regaining  his 
senses,  Ravana,  the  terror  of  all  beings,  Lord  of  Lanka,  showered 
missiles  on  the  person  of  Mandhata  and,  beholding  that  king 
falling  unconscious,  the  highly  powerful  rangers  of  the  night 
were  greatly  delighted  and  emitted  leonine  roars. 

"  Regaining  his  senses  in  a  moment,  the  King  of  Ayodhya, 
beholding  his  adversary  acclaimed  by  his  followers  and  ministers, 
was  enraged,  and  assuming  a  dazzling  form  like  unto  the  sun  or 
moon,  instantly  began  to  slay  the  titans  with  a  dreadful  hail  of

shafts ;  and  bis  arrows  and  the  noise  thereof  overwhelmed  the 
entire  Rakshasa  Host,  that  resembled  a  tempestuous  ocean. 

"  Thereupon  a  fearful  conflict  arose  between  man  and  demon 
and  those  two  heroic  and  high-souled  leaders  of  men  and 
Rakshasas,  like  persons  possessed,  taking  up  the  attitude  of 
warriors,  entered  the  field  with  swords  and  bows  and,  highly 
enraged,  began  to  assail  each  other  with  shafts,  wounding  each 
other  in  the  attack.  Then,  setting  the  Raudra-weapon  on  his 
bow,  Ravana  discharged  it,  but  Mandhata  turned  it  aside  with 
the  Fire-weapon.  Thereafter  Dashanana  took  up  the  Gand- 
harva  weapon  and  King  Mandhata  the  Brahma-astra,  a  source  of 
terror  to  all.  And  Ravana  took  Up  the  Celestial  and  dreadful 
Pashupata-weapon,  the  increaser  of  fear  in  the  Three  Worlds, 
obtained  from  Rudra,  by  virtue  of  his  rigid  penances. 

"  Beholding  this,  all  moveable  and  immoveable  beings  were 
stricken  with  terror  and  the  Three  Worlds,  including  all  that 
was  animate  and  inanimate,  Gods  and  Serpents,  together  took 
refuge  in  their  abodes  under  the  earth. 

"  Meantime,  by  virtue  of  their  meditation,  the  two  foremost 
of  ascetics,  Poulastya  and  Galava,  aware  of  the  conflict,  remon- 
strated with  these  two  warriors  in  various  ways  and  restrained 
the  King  and  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas.  Thereafter  the  man 
and  the  Rakshasa  were  reconciled  and,  highly  delighted,  returned 
from  whence  they  had  come."

Ravana  visits  the  Moon  Region  and  is  given  a  Boon  by  Brahma 

"  The  two  Rishis  having  departed,  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the 
Rakshasas,  proceeded  for  forty  thousand  miles  in  the  upper  air, 
whereupon  he  reached  that  excellent  higher  sphere  where  swans, 
endowed  with  every  virtue,  dwell.  And,  having  gone  on,  he 
ascended  yet  higher  for  ten  thousand  leagues,  where  on  all 
sides,  the  clouds,  Agneya,  Pakshana  and  Brahma1  are  eternally

established.  Thereafter,  he  proceeded  to  an  excellent  airy 
region  where  the  high-souled  Siddhas  and  Charanas  ever  abide, 
which  is  ten  thousand  leagues  in  extent. 

"  O  Slayer  of  thy  Foes,  he  then  passed  to  a  fourth  region,  where 
the  Bhutas  and  Vinayakas  perpetually  sojourn  and  thereafter,  he 
went  to  the  fifth  aerial  realm,  which  extends  over  ten  thousand 
leagues,  where  Gunga,  the  foremost  of  rivers  is  to  be  found,  and 
the  elephants  headed  by  Kumuda,  from  whose  bodies,  drops 
pour  down  constantly  as  they  sport  in  the  waters,  spout  forth 
the  sacred  stream  which  they  sprinkle  in  all  directions.  Here 
the  waters  fall  down  in  rain  and  snow  under  the  rays  of  the  sun, 
purified  by  the  wind,  O  Raghava. 

"  Then  that  Rakshasa  went  to  the  sixth  aerial  region,  O  Thou 
endowed  with  great  radiance,  where  Garuda  dwells,  ever  revered 
by  his  kinsfolk  and  friends,  and,  thereafter,  ascended  to  the 
seventh  aerial  region,  lying  ten  thousand  leagues  higher,  where 
the  Seven  Rishis  dwell.1  And  again  proceeding  ten  thousand 
leagues  higher  he  reached  the  eighth  aerial  region  where  Gunga, 
known  as  the  Ganges  of  the  sky,  having  strong  currents,  is  found 
in  die  path  of  the  sun  and,  who,  upheld  by  air,  sends  forth  a  great 
roaring. 

**  Now  I  shall  describe  the  region  yet  higher  than  these,  where 
the  Moon-god  dwells  and  the  extent  thereof  is  eighty  thousand 
leagues.  There  the  Moon  encircled  by  stars  and  planets,  from 
whom  hundreds  and  thousands  of  rays  stream  forth,  illumines 
the  world,  bringing  happiness  to  all  beings. 

"  Thereupon,  beholding  Dashagriva,  the  Moon,  blazing  up 
as  it  were,  consumed  him  with  its  cold  fires  and,  stricken  with 
fear  of  those  rays,  his  counsellors  were  unable  to  withstand  them 
and  Prahasta,  uttering  the  words  c  Let  victory  be  thine !  *  there- 
after said : — 

"  *  0  King,  we  are  being  destroyed  by  the  cold  and  must  leave 
this  place  !  O  Foremost  of  Monarchs,  the  icy  rays  of  the  moon 
have  the  property  of  fire.* 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  Prahasta,  Ravana,  beside  himself  with 
wrath,  lifted  his  bow,  twanging  it  and  began  to  assail  the  Moon 
with  Narachas,  whereupon  Brahma  speedily  went  to  that  lunar 
region  and  said : —

"  '  O  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  do  not  repeat  this  mantra  daily 
but  only  when  thy  life  is  in  danger.  Holding  a  string  of  Rud-

Ravana  and  the  MahaPurusha 

"  Having  conferred  that  favour  on  Ravana,  the  Grandsire, 
sprung  from  the  lotus,  speedily  went  to  his  own  region  and 
Ravana,  having  obtained  the  boon,  departed. 

"After  a  few  days,  that  Scourge  of  the  Worlds,  the  Rakshasa 
Ravana  with  his  counsellors  reached  the  banks  of  the  western 
ocean  and,  on  an  island,  a  person  was  seen  seated  there  alone, 
bright  as  fire,  named  Mahajambunada.  His  form  was  dreadful 
like  unto  the  Fire  of  Dissolution  and,  beholding  that  highly 
powerful  Being  resembling  Mahendra,  the  Chief  of  the  Gods 
among  the  Celestials,  or  the  sun  among  the  planets,  a  lion  among 
the  Sharabhas,  Airavata  among  elephants,  Sumeru  among 
mountains  and  Parijata  among  trees,  Dashagriva  said  : — 

" '  Enter  into  combat  with  me ! '  and  his  eyes  flickered  like  a 
cluster  of  planets.1  Gnashing  his  teeth,  he  made  a  sound  like  a 
grinding  mill  and  the  highly  powerful  Dashanana  amidst  his 
counsellors,  roared  aloud.  Thereafter  with  darts,  Shatis, 
Rishtis  and  Pattikas,  he  assailed  that  highly  effulgent  Being  of 
long  arms,  dread  aspect,  huge  teeth,  grim  form,  conch-like  neck, 
broad  chest,  frog-like  belly,  leonine  countenance,  feet  like  unto 
the  summit  of  Mount  Kailasha,  the  palms  of  his  hands  and  the 
soles  of  his  feet  like  unto  red  lotuses,  endowed  with  the 
swiftness  of  thought  and  the  wind,  terrifying,  bearing  a  quiver, 
adorned  with  bells  and  chowries,  encircled  by  flames,  emitting

a  sweet  sound  like  a  net-work  of  Kinkinis,1  wearing  a  garland  of 
golden  Sowers  round  his  neck,  noble,  like  unto  the  Rig- Veda  and 
resembling  the  Anjana  or  Golden  Mountain. 

"As  a  lion  remains  unmoved  by  the  attack  of  a  wolf  or  an 
elephant}  or  Mount  Sumeru  by  the  King  of  the  Serpents,  or  the 
vast  ocean  by  the  current  of  a  river,  neither  was  that  great 
Being  perturbed,  but  addressing  Dashagriva,  said : — 

" '  O  Vicious-minded  Night-ranger,  I  shall  soon  rid  thee  of 
thy  desire  for  combat.' 

"  O  Rama,  the  might  of  that  Being  was  a  thousand  times 
greater  than  Ravana's,  which  was  a  source  of  terror  to  the  worlds. 
Piety  and  asceticism,  which  are  the  roots  of  attainment  of 
everything  in  the  world,  are  in  his  thighs,  desire  is  in  his  male- 
organ,  the  Vishvadevas  are  at  his  waist  and  the  winds  at  the  side 
of  his  intestines ;  the  eight  Vasus  dwell  in  his  middle,  the 
oceans  abide  in  his  belly,  the  quarters  are  his  hips,  the  Maruts 
his  joints,  the  Pittris  are  at  his  back  and  the  Grandsire  has  taken 
refuge  in  his  heart.  Charitable  acts  of  making  many  gifts  of 
kine,  gold  and  land  are  the  hair  in  his  armpits ;  the  Mountains, 
Himalaya,  Hemakuta,  Mandara  and  Meru  are  his  bones,  the 
thunderbolt  is  in  his  palm,  the  sky  in  his  frame,  the  evening 
rain-clouds  are  on  his  neck ;  the  Creator  and  Preserver  and  the 
Vidyadharas  are  his  arms ;  Ananta,  Vasuki,  Vishalaksha, 
Iravat,  Kamvala,  Asvatara,  Karkotaka,  Dhananjaya,  the  veno- 
mous Takshaka  and  Utpatakshaka2  have  taken  shelter  under  his 
nails  in  order  to  vomit  forth  their  poison.  Fire  is  in  his  mouth, 
the  Rudras  on  his  shoulders ;  the  fortnights,  months,  years  and 
seasons  in  his  jaws,  the  lunar  fortnight  and  the  dark  half  of  the 
month  are  his  nostrils,  the  airy  currents  are  the  pores  of  his  body, 
Saraswati  with  her  Vina  is  in  his  throat,  the  Asvins  are  in  his 
ears  and  the  sun  and  moon  in  his  two  eyes. 

"  O  Rama,  all  the  branches  of  the  Veda  and  the  sacrifices,  the 
whole  galaxy  of  stars,  sweet  speech,  good  deeds,  energy  and 
asceticism  are  supported  by  his  body  in  human  form. 

"  Then  that  Purusha  struck  Ravana  playfully  with  his  hands, 
which  were  as  powerful  as  lightning  arid,  thus  assailed,  Ravana 
fell  to  the  ground  immediately  and  having  put  that  Night-

ranger  to  flight  that  great  Purusha,  like  unto  the  Rig-Veda, 
resembling  a  mountain  be-decked  with  lotus  wreaths,  entered 
the  region  under  the  earth. 

"  Then  Ravana  addressed  his  counsellors  thus : — 

"  *  O  Prahasta,  O  Shuka,  O  Sarana  and  ye  other  ministers, 
where  has  that  Purusha  suddenly  gone  ?    Do  ye  tell  me  ! ' 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  Ravana,  the  Night-rangers  said  : — 
'  That  Purusha,  who  crusheth  the  pride  of  Devas  and  Danavas, 
has  entered  into  that  place !  * 

"As  Garuda  swoops  on  a  serpent  so  did  that  wicked-minded 
Ravana  speedily  approach  the  entrance  of  that  cave  and  entered 
it  fearlessly.  Penetrating  there,  he  beheld  three  warriors,  dark 
like  unto  collyrium,  wearing  Keyuras,1  adorned  with  red  garlands, 
besmeared  with  sandalpaste,  bedecked  with  diverse  golden 
ornaments  set  with  gems ;  and  be  saw  three  crores  of  exalted 
beings,  fearless,  pure,  radiant  as  fire,  intent  on  dancing. 

"  Beholding  them,  Dashagriva  was  not  in  the  least  afraid  but 
watched  them  gyrating  whilst  he  stood  at  the  entrance ;  and 
they  all  resembled  the  Maha-Purusha,  who  had  previously  been 
seen  by  him,  and  all  were  of  similar  colour,  dress,  form  and  all 
equally  endowed  with  energy.  Then  the  hair  of  Dashagriva 
stood  on  end  as  he  gazed  upon  them  but,  on  account  of  the  boon 
he  had  received  from  the  Self-born,  he  issued  out  of  that  place 
alive.  Thereafter  be  saw  the  Maha  Purusha  lying  on  a  couch, 
and  his  dwelling,  his  seat  and  his  bed  were  all  white  and  costly 
and  he  slept  there  enveloped  in  flames. 

"And  there,  with  a  fan  in  her  lotus-like  hands  sat  the  Goddess 
Lakshmi,  most  beautiful  in  all  the  Three  Worlds  and  their 
decoration,  as  it  were ;  chaste,  adorned  with  celestial  garlands, 
sprinkled  with  excellent  sandal-paste,  bedecked  with  rich 
ornaments  and  clad  in  costly  robes.  And  the  wicked  Ravana, 
Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  having  entered  there  without  a  counsellor, 
beholding  that  chaste  damsel  of  sweet  smiles,  seated  on  a  royal 
throne,  became  filled  with  desire  and  wished  to  hold  her  by  the 
hand,  as  one  under  the  sway  of  death  fondles  a  sleeping  serpent. 

"  Beholding  that  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas  with  a  loosened 
garment  and  knowing  him  desirous  of  taking  hold  of  her,  the 
huge-armed  Deity,  sleeping,  enveloped  in  names,  laughed  aloud

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  suddenly  by  his  power  began  to  consume  Ravana,  the 
harasser  of  his  foes,  who  fell  down  on  the  earth  like  an  uprooted 
tree.  Beholding  that  Rakshasa  fallen,  the  Purusha  addressed 
him  saying: — 

"  *  Rise  up,  O  Foremost  of  the  Rakshasas,  thou  shalt  not  meet 
with  death  to-day  !  Thou  shalt  live  protected  by  the  Grandsire's 
boon.  Do  thou  therefore  go  hence  without  fear,  O  Ravana,  thy 
death  is  not  yet  decreed ! ' 

"  Regaining  consciousness  after  a  while,  Ravana  was  seized 
with  fear  and  being  thus  addressed,  that  enemy  of  the  Gods 
rose  up,  his  hair  standing  on  end  and  said  to  that  highly  resplen- 
dent Deity  :— 

"  *  Who  art  thou  endowed  with  great  energy  and  like  unto  the 
Fire  of  Dissolution  ?  Say  who  art  thou,  O  God  and  from 
whence  hast  thou  come  hither  ?  ' 

"  Being  thus  accosted  by  the  wicked-minded  Ravana,  the  God, 
smiling,  replied  in  accents  as  deep  as  the  muttering  of  clouds, 
saying: — 

"  '  What  hast  thou  to  do  with  me,  O  Dashagriva,  thou  shalt 
be  slain  ere  long !  * 

"  Being  thus  addressed,  the  Ten-necked  Rakshasa,  with 
joined  palms,  said  : — 

"  '  On  account  of  Brahma's  boon,  I  shall  not  tread  the  path 
of  death ;  there  is  none  born  amongst  men  or  Gods  who  can 
equal  me  or,  in  virtue  of  his  prowess,  disregard  the  Grandsire's 
boon.  His  words  may  never  prove  vain  nor  can  any,  howsoever 
he  exert  himself,  prove  them  to  be  false ;  I  do  not  see  any  in  the 
Three  Worlds  who  could  render  his  boon  to  me  void.  O  Great 
God,  I  am  immortal,  I  do  not  fear  Thee  and  even  were  I  to 
meet  with  death,  may  it  be  through  thee  and  none  other,  O  Lord; 
death  at  Thy  hands  will  bring  me  glory  and  renown  1  * 

"  Then  Ravana  endowed  with  dreadful  prowess  saw  the 
Three  Worlds  with  all  the  animate  and  inanimate  creatures 
within  the  body  of  the  Deity.  The  Adityas,  the  Maruts,  the 
Sadhyas,  the  Vasus,  the  Twin  Ashvins,  the  Rudras,  the  Pittris, 
Yaina,  Kuvera,  the  seas,  mountains,  rivers,  all  the  branches  of 
learning  and  of  the  Veda,  Fire,  the  planets,  the  stars,  the  sky, 
the  Siddhas,  Gandharvas,  Charanas  and  the  Alaha  Rishis 
conversant  with  the  knowledge  of  the  Veda,  Garuda,  the  Nagas,

the  other  Gods,  Yakshas,  Daityas  and  Rakshasas  were  all  seen 
in  their  subtle  forms  in  the  limbs  of  that  Purusha  lying  there.  " 

On  this,  the  virtuous-souled  Rama  said  to  Agastya,  the  fore- 
most of  Munis : — "  O  Lord,  tell  me  who  was  that  Maha  Purusha 
on  that  island  ?  Who  were  those  hundreds  and  thousands  of 
beings  ?  Who  is  the  Purusha  who  humbles  the  pride  of  Daityas 
and  Danavas  ?  " 

Hearing  Rama's  words,  Shri  Agastya  answered : — 

"  O  Thou  existing  eternally,  O  God  of  Gods,  hearken  and  I 
will  tell  thee.  That  Purusha  on  the  island  was  the  illustrious 
Kapila  and  all  those  who  were  dancing  are  the  Deities  equalling 
that  intelligent  Kapila  in  energy  and  power.  And  that  Rak- 
shasa,  bent  on  sin,  was  not  looked  on  by  Him  with  a  wrathful 
glance,  therefore  he  was  not  immediately  reduced  to  ashes,  but 
Ravana,  who  resembled  a  mountain,  with  his  person  pierced,  fell 
to  the  ground.  As  a  crafty  man  penetrates  a  secret,  so  did  that 
Purusha  pierce  Ravana's  person  with  his  arrow-like  words. 

"  Thereafter  that  Rakshasa  of  great  prowess,  having  regained 
his  senses  after  a  long  time,  returned  to  where  his  counsellors 
were." 


chapter  24 

Ravana  carries  off  a  number  of  Women  and  is  cursed  by  them 

"While  Ravana  of  perverse  soul  was  returning  in  the  height  of 
joy,  continuing  his  journey,  he  bore  away  the  youthful  daughters 
of  Kings,  Rishis,  Gods  and  Danavas.  Whenever  he  met  a  young 
maiden  of  remarkable  beauty,  he  slew  all  her  kinsfolk  and  friends 
and  took  her  into  his  chariot.  Thus  the  daughters  of  Pannagas, 
Rakshasas,  Asuras,  men  and  Yakshas  were  compelled  to  enter 
his  equipage  and  all  these  unfortunate  beings,  under  the  sway  of 
fear,  in  their  grief,  shed  burning  tears  like  unto  fire. 

"  The  youthful  daughters  of  Nagas,  Gandharvas,  great  Rishis 
and  Danavas  lamented  in  their  hundreds  in  the  aerial  Car 
Pushpaka,  and  those  charming  women  with  long  tresses,  graceful 
limbs  and  faces  as  radiant  as  the  full  moon,  with  their  rounded 
breasts  gleaming  like  an  altar  and  decorated  with  diamonds, 
457 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

their  hips  like  unto  the  axles  of  a  chariot,  who  resembled  the 
consorts  of  the  Gods  with  their  elegant  waists  and  their  complex- 
ion like  unto  refined  gold,  were  mad  with  fear  and  grief.  The 
breath  of  their  sighing  scorched  the  ear,  lending  the  Pushpaka 
Chariot  the  appearance  of  a  fire  ceremony  that  is  lit  on  all  sides. 

"  Fallen  into  the  power  of  Dashagriva,  those  women  were 
overcome  with  affliction  and  the  sadness  expressed  in  their  looks 
and  mien  caused  them  to  resemble  black  antelopes  that  have 
become  a  prey  to  a  lion.  And  one  asked  herself '  Is  he  not  going 
to  devour  me  ?  *  whilst  another,  in  the  despair  that  overwhelmed 
her,  thought  *  He  is  about  to  slay  me ! '  Recollecting  their 
mothers,  fathers,  husbands  and  brothers,  plunged  in  grief  and 
affliction,  those  women,  thus  assembled  began  to  lament, 
saying : — 

"  'Alas  !  What  will  become  of  my  son  without  me  ?  What 
will  become  of  my  mother  ? '  And,  submerged  in  an  ocean  of 
grief,  they  cried  '  What  can  I  do  now  far  from  my  lord  ?  O 
Death,  I  call  upon  thee  to  bear  me  away  for  affliction  is  now  my 
portion.  Have  I  committed  some  misdeed  formerly  in  another 
body?' 

"  Then  all  those  wretched  women,  sunk  in  an  ocean  of  despair 
exclaimed  : — *  We  see  no  end  to  our  misery  !  Woe  unto  the 
world  !  Assuredly  none  is  more  vile  than  the  mighty  Ravana, 
since  under  his  blows  our  helpless  consorts  have  perished,  as 
stars  disappear  on  the  rising  of  the  sun.  Ah  !  That  powerful 
Rakshasa  takes  delight  in  devising  the  means  of  our  destruction  ! 
Alas !  He  gives  himself  up  to  evil  without  scruple,  he  is  in- 
different to  every  condemnation ;  till  now  none  has  been  able 
to  put  an  end  to  the  exploits  of  this  wicked  wretch,  yet  it  is  a 
great  sin  to  lay  hands  on  other  men's  wives ;  this  Rakshasa  is  the 
vilest  of  all  since  he  seeks  enjoyment  with  them.  Because  of 
this,  a  woman  will  be  the  cause  of  the  death  of  this  wicked 
being ! ' 

"  When  those  virtuous  and  noble  women  had  uttered  these 
words,  celestial  gongs  sounded  and  a  shower  of  blossom  fell. 
Cursed  by  his  captives,  Dashagriva  seemed  to  lose  all  his  power  and 
glory  and,  hearing  those  women,  who  were  chaste  and  devoted 
to  their  consorts,  lamenting  in  this  wise,  that  bull  among  the 
Rakshasas  became  distracted.

"  Thereafter  he  made  his  entry  into  the  City  of  Lanka  to  the 
acclamations  of  the  rangers  of  the  night  and,  at  that  time,  the 
fierce  Rakshasi,  who  was  able  to  change  her  form  at  will,  the 
sister  of  Ravana,  suddenly  sank  down  on  the  earth  before  him, 
and  Ravana,  helping  her  to  rise  and  comforting  her,  said  : — 

"  '  O  Dear  One,  what  is  this  ?  Why  dost  thou  seek  speech 
with  me  so  urgently  ? ' 

"  Thereupon,  her  eyes  inflamed  and  suffused  with  tears,  she 
said  to  him  : — 

"  *  O  King,  I  have  been  widowed  through  thy  ruthless 
conduct !  O  Lord,  thy  valour  in  combat  has  cut  down  those 
Daityas  called  Ralakeyas  to  the  number  of  fourteen  thousand  and, 
in  addition,  my  valiant  lord  who  was  dearer  to  me  than  life 
itself.  He  was  slain  by  thee,  his  foe,  a  brother  in  name  only  and, 
by  thee,  I  myself  am  slain,  O  Prince,  thou  my  kinsman  !  From 
now,  I  shall  bear  the  title  of  widow  through  thy  fault !  Was  it 
not  for  thee  to  spare  a  brother-in-law  in  the  fight  ?  * 

"  Hearing  those  indignant  words  from  bis  sister,  Dashagriva, 
in  order  to  appease  her,  spoke  soothingly,  saying : — 

"  •  Dry  thy  tears,  my  dear  sister  and  fear  nothing !  I  shall 
load  thee  with  gifts,  homage  and  favours.  In  the  heat  of  battle, 
being  carried  away  by  a  desire  to  triumph,  I  loosed  my  shafts 
without  being  able  to  distinguish  mine  own  people  from  others 
and  did  not  recognize  my  brother-in-law  whom  I  struck  in  the 
height  of  the  conflict.  That  is  how  thy  consort  fell  under  my 
blows  in  the  fight.  O  My  Sister,  whatever  presents  itself  at  this 
time,  I  will  do  for  thy  pleasure.  It  is  for  thee  to  go  and  live  near 
thy  kinsman,  Khara,  who  enjoys  sovereignty.  Fourteen 
thousand  Rakshasas  will  be  made  subject  to  that  powerful 
Prince  in  the  expeditions  and  distribution  of  spoils.  There,  that 
son  of  the  sister  of  thy  mother,  thy  cousin  Khara,  the  Ranger  of 
the  Night,  will  ever  be  obedient  to  thy  commands.  Let  that 
warrior  speedily  go  and  guard  the  Dandaka  Forest ;  Dushana 
shall  be  his  commander  ;  great  is  his  valour.  The  courageous 
Khara  shall  ever  obey  thy  will  and  be  the  leader  of  the  titans 
able  to  change  their  form  at  pleasure.' 

"  Having  spoken  thus,  Dashagriva  placed  an  army  of  fourteen 
thousand  Rakshasas,  full  of  valour,  under  Khara's  command. 
Surrounded  by  all  those  titans  of  redoubtable  appearance, 
459 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Khara  set  out  fearlessly  at  once  to  the  Dandaka  Forest.  There 
he  established  his  authority  without  hindrance  and  Shurpanakha 
dwelt  near  him  in  the  forest." 


CHAPTER     25 

Dashagriva  allies  himself  to  Madhu 

"  Dashagriva,  having  given  over  that  redoubtable  army  to 
Khara  and  consoled  his  sister,  became  master  of  himself  once 
more  and  was  freed  from  anxiety. 

"  Thereafter  that  powerful  Indra  among  the  Rakshasas 
penetrated  into  the  marvellous  NikumbhiJa  Grove  where  he 
beheld  hundreds  of  sacrificial  posts  and  altars  and,  as  if  blazing 
in  brilliance,  a  sacrifice  was  being  performed. 

"  There,  clad  in  a  black  antelope  skin,  holding  a  coconut 
loshta  and  staff,  he  beheld  his  own  son,  Meghanada  of  dread 
aspect.  Approaching  bim,  the  Lord  of  Lanka,  clasping  him  in 
his  arms,  enquired  of  him : — 

"  '  What  art  thou  doing  here,  O  Child,  tell  me  truly !  * 

"  Then  that  excellent  Twice-born  of  rigid  penances,  Ushanas,1 
in  order  that  the  sacrifice  should  prove  auspicious,1  answered 
Ravana,  saying : — 

" '  I  shall  tell  thee  myself,  O  King,  listen  to  all  that  has  taken 
place.  Seven  sacrifices  with  countless  preparatory  rites  have  been 
undertaken  by  thy  son,  the  Agnisthoma,  Ashvamedha,  Bahus- 
varnaka,  Rajasuya,  Gomedha  and  the  Vaishnava  and,  having 
engaged  in  the  Maheshvara  sacrifice,  difficult  for  men  to  under- 
take, thy  son,  on  its  completion,  received  gifts  from  the  Lord  of 
Creatures  Himself :  a  stable  and  celestial  chariot  coursing  at  will 
in  the  sky,  the  power  of  illusion  by  which  darkness  is  created  on 
the  field  of  battle  so  that  even  the  Gods  and  Asuras  can  no 
longer  find  their  way,  and,  in  order  to  exterminate  the  foe  in 
combat,  O  King,  he  has  also  been  granted  two  inexhaustible 

1  Ushanas — another  name  of  the  Sage  Sukra. 

*  Meghanada  having  taken  the  vow  of  silence  till  the  ceremony  waa

quivers,  a  bow  that  no  weapon  can  shatter  and  a  powerful  arrow. 
Having  received  these  gifts,  thy  son,  O  Dashanana,  wishes  to  meet 
with  thee  on  the  completion  of  the  sacrifice  and  will  soon 
present  himself  before  thee.' 

"  Then  Dashagriva  said  : — 

"  '  This  is  not  well  done,  since  our  enemy,  Indra,  has  been 
worshipped  with  these  offerings.  However,  what  is  done  is 
done  and  doubtless  thou  wilt  acquire  merit  thereby,  let  us  now 
return,  My  Friend,  and  enter  our  abode.' 

"  Thereafter  Dashagriva  with  his  son  and  Bibishana  returned 
to  his  dwelling  and  caused  all  the  captives,  who  were  crying  and 
sobbing,  to  be  brought  down ;  and  the  virtuous  Bibishana,  being 
aware  of  his  intention  regarding  those  women,  who  were  noble 
and  veritable  pearls,  the  offspring  of  the  Gods,  Danavas  and 
Rakshasas,  said  to  his  brother : — 

" '  It  is  practices  such  as  these,  which  thou  dost  follow  with 
deliberate  intention  despite  thy  knowledge  of  the  causes  of 
destruction  of  beings,  that  are  ruinous  to  thy  good  name,  thy 
family  and  fortune !  After  ill-treating  their  relatives,  thou  hast 
carried  away  these  high-born  women,  whilst  Madhu  affronts 
thee  by  carrying  off  Kumbhinasi,' 

"  Then  Ravana  answered : — *  I  was  not  aware  of  this ;  who 
is  this  Madhu  of  whom  thou  speakest  ?  *  and  Bibishana  replied 
to  his  brother  indignantly  and  said : — 

" '  Learn  the  consequences  of  thine  evil  karma !  The  elder 
brother  of  our  maternal  grandfather,  Sumali,  that  virtuous  old 
man  named  Malyavan,  Ranger  of  the  Night,  the  father  of  our 
mother,  is  the  grandfather  of  Kumbbinasi,  so  that  we  are 
virtually  her  brothers.  She  has  been  borne  away  by  Madhu,  a 
Rakshasa  of  superior  power,  while  thy  son  was  engaged  in  the 
sacrifice  and  I  was  bathing  in  the  waters.  Kumbhakarna,  on  his 
side,  was  still  under  the  influence  of  sleep.  Having  slain  the 
aged  ministers,  that  foremost  of  night-rangers  instantly  carried 
away  the  princess  most  ruthlessly,  though  she  was  in  the 
precincts  of  the  inner  apartments.  Though  these  ill-tidings 
were  known  to  us,  we  did  not  slay  the  ravisher  since  it  is  impera- 
tive that  a  young  girl  be  provided  with  a  consort  by  her  brothers. 
This  is  the  fruit  of  thy  perverse  and  wicked  conduct  which,  as 
thou  seest,  thou  art  now  reaping  in  this  world  itself.' 
461 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Hearing  these  words  of  Bibishana's,  that  Indra  of  the 
Rakshasas,  Ravana,  wrought  up  through  the  wickedness  of  his 
soul,  like  unto  an  ocean  with  surging  waves,  his  eyes  red  with 
anger,  said : — 

"  *  Let  my  chariot  be  harnessed  speedily,  let  my  warriors 
stand  ready  with  my  brother  Kumbhakarna  and  the  foremost  of 
the  rangers  of  the  night  in  their  conveyances  heaped  with  every 
weapon.  To-day,  having  slain  Madhu,  who  dares  to  defy 
Ravana,  I  shall  go  to  the  region  of  the  Gods,  burning  to  fight, 
surrounded  by  my  companions.' 

"  Four  thousand  Akshauhinis  of  the  foremost  of  the  titans, 
armed  from  head  to  foot  with  various  weapons,  instantly  rushed 
out,  eager  for  hand  to  hand  encounter,  and  Indrajita  marched  in 
the  advance  guard  with  his  warriors.  Ravana  occupied  the 
centre  and  Kumbhakarna  the  rearguard.  As  for  the  virtuous 
Bibishana,  he  remained  in  Lanka,  faithful  to  his  duty.  All  the 
other  warriors  advanced  against  Madhu's  city  and  they  were 
mounted  on  mules,  buffalo,  fiery  steeds,  porpoises  and  great 
serpents,  covering  the  sky  and,  beholding  Ravana  on  the  march, 
hundreds  of  Daityas,  who  were  at  emnity  with  the  Gods,  followed 
him. 

"  Meanwhile  Dashanana,  having  reached  Madhupura,  entered 
it,  yet  he  did  not  find  Madhu  there  but  his  own  sister,  who, 
paying  obeisance  to  him,  with  a  deep  bow  cast  herself  at  bis  feet, 
for  Kumbhinasi  feared  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas. 

"  Then  he,  raising  her  up,  said  to  her : — 

"  *  Do  not  tremble ! '  and  the  King  of  the  Rakshasas  added 
'  What  dost  thou  desire  of  me  ? '  Then  she  replied : — *  O 
Long-armed  Prince,  if  I  find  favour  with  thee,  then,  O  Proud 
Hero,  do  not  slay  my  lord ;  it  is  not  fitting  to  reduce  women  of 
nobility  to  such  affliction.  Of  all  ill-fortune,  to  become  a  widow 
is  the  greatest.  Be  true  to  thy  word,  O  Indra  of  Monarchs,  and 
receive  my  supplication  with  favour.  Thou  hast  thyself  said 
"  Thou  hast  nothing  to  fear  1 "  * 

"  Then  Ravana,  in  cheerful  tones,  answered  his  sister,  who 
stood  near  him,  saying : — '  Where  is  thy  husband,  tell  me 
quickly  !  I  shall  go  with  him  to  conquer  the  region  of  the  Gods. 
I  shall  not  slay  Madhu  because  of  my  tender  affection  for  thee.' 

"At  these  words,  Kumbhinasi  roused  her  lord,  that  Ranger  of 
4«2 


UTTARA    KANDA 

the  Night,  who  was  sleeping  profoundly  and,  in  the  height  of 
joy,  said  to  him : — 

"  *  My  powerful  brother,  Dashagriva,  is  here,  who  desires  to 
vanquish  the  world  of  the  Gods  ;  he  has  chosen  thee  as  his  ally, 
therefore  go,  O  Titan,  with  thy  kinsmen  and  lend  him  thy  strong 
support.  It  is  fitting  that  thou  shouldst  assist  him  in  this  matter 
on  account  of  his  magnanimity  and  the  honour  which  he  has 
paid  thee.' 

"  On  hearing  this,  Madhu  answered, '  So  be  it ! '  and  behold- 
ing Havana,  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  he  approached  him 
according  to  tradition  and  paid  him  due  tribute. 

"  Thus  honoured,  Dashagriva  passed  a  night  in  Madhu's 
abode  and  then  started  on  his  way.  Having  reached  Kailasha, 
that  mountain  that  served  as  Vaishravana's  retreat,  the  Indra 
among  the  Rakshasas,  like  unto  Mahendra,  caused  his  army  to 
set  up  camp." 


CHAPTER     26 

Nalakuvara  curses  Ravana 

"  It  was  on  Kailasha,  the  sun  having  withdrawn  behind  the 
Astachala  Range,  that  Dashagriva,  full  of  vigour,  chose  to 
encamp  the  army. 

"  When  the  immaculate  moon  rose  over  the  mountain  with  a 
splendour  equal  to  his,  the  vast  host  that  composed  the  army, 
furnished  with  diverse  weapons,  lay  sleeping. 

"  The  mighty  Ravana,  resting  on  the  summit  of  the  mountain, 
surveyed  the  splendour  of  the  forests  in  the  light  of  the  moon, 
the  flaming  Karnikara  Woods,  the  Kadambas  and  Vakulas, 
pools  covered  with  lotuses  in  bloom,  the  waters  of  the  Manda- 
kini,  the  Champaka,  Ashoka,  Punnaga,  Mandara,  Cuta,  Patala, 
Lodhra,  Priyanga,  Arjuna,  Ketaka,  Tagara,  Narikela,  Priyala, 
Panasa  and  other  trees.  Sweet-throated  Kinneras,  transported 
with  love,  sang  melodies  that  ravished  the  soul  with  delight ; 
there  the  Vidyadharas,  intoxicated,  their  eyes  inflamed,  diverted 
themselves  with  their  consorts.  Like  unto  a  carillon  of  bells, 
sweet  music  was  heard  from  the  troops  of  Apsaras  who  were 
463 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

singing  in  Dhanada's  abode.  Trees,  shaken  by  the  wind, 
covered  the  mountain  with  a  shower  of  blossom,  distilling  the 
perfume  of  honey  and  mead,  and  a  balmy  breeze,  laden  with  the 
enchanting  aroma  of  nectar  and  pollen,  blew,  enhancing  Ravana's 
voluptuous  desire.  The  songs,  the  myriad  flowers,  the  freshness 
of  the  breeze,  the  beauty  of  the  mountain  in  the  night,  the  moon 
at  its  zenith,  threw  Ravana,  that  mighty  warrior,  into  a  ferment  of 
passion. 

"  Meanwhile,  Rambha,  loveliest  of  nymphs  adorned  with 
celestial  ornaments,  was  on  her  way  to  a  sacred  festival  and  her 
face  was  like  unto  the  full  moon,  her  limbs  smeared  with  sandal- 
paste,  her  hair  sown  with  Mandara  flowers,  and  she  was  garlanded 
with  celestial  blooms.  Her  eyes  were  beautiful,  her  waist  high, 
adorned  with  a  jewelled  belt,  and  her  hips  were  shapely,  the 
gift  of  love  as  it  were.  She  was  enchanting  with  her  countenance 
embellished  with  the  marks  of  flowers1  that  bloom  in  the  six 
seasons  and,  in  her  beauty,  stateliness,  radiance  and  splendour, 
she  resembled  Shri.  Swathed  in  a  dark  blue  cloth,  like  unto  a 
rain  cloud,  her  countenance  bright  as  the  moon,  her  eyebrows 
resplendent  arches,  her  hips  like  the  tapering  trunks  of  elephants, 
her  hands  like  two  fresh  buds,  under  Ravana's  eyes  she  passed 
through  the  ranks  of  the  army. 

"  Thereupon  he,  rising,  pierced  by  the  shafts  of  love,  with  his 
hand  stayed  the  course  of  that  nymph  who  was  abashed  and, 
smiling,  enquired  of  her  : — 

"  '  Where  art  thou  going,  O  Lady  of  lovely  hips  ?  What  good 
fortune  art  thou  pursuing  ?  For  whom  has  this  auspicious  hour 
dawned  ?  Who  is  about  to  enjoy  thee  ?  Who,  this  day,  will 
quaff  the  elixir  of  thy  lips  exhaling  the  perfume  of  the  lotus  that 
rivals  nectar  or  ambrosia  ?  Who  will  caress  those  two  breasts 
like  unto  twin  goblets,  rounded,  blooming,  that  touch  each 
other,  O  Youthful  Woman  ?  Who  will  stroke  thy  large  hips 
shining  like  refined  gold  covered  with  dazzling  garlands,  celestial 
to  look  upon  ?  Is  it  Shakra  or  Vishnu  or  the  Twin  Ashvins  ? 
O  Lovely  One,  if  thou  dost  pass  me  by  in  order  to  seek  out 
another,  it  will  not  be  a  gracious  act  1  Rest  here,  O  Lady  of

palms  address  this  humble  request  to  thee,  I,  Dashanana,  Lord 
of  die  Three  Worlds  and  their  Ordainer,  therefore  grant  my 
request.' 

"  Hearing  these  words,  Rambha,  trembling,  with  joined 
palms,  replied : — '  Look  on  me  with  favour,  it  is  not  fitting  that 
thou  shouldst  address  me  thus,  thou  who  art  my  superior! 
Rather  is  it  thy  duty  to  protect  me  from  others  if  I  should  be  in 
danger  of  suffering  violence  at  their  hands,  for  apart  from  duty, 
I  am  virtually  thy  daughter-in-law,  I  speak  truth !  * 

"  Then  Dashagriva  answered  Rambha,  who  had  prostrated 
herself  at  his  feet  and  whose  hair  stood  on  end  merely  on  behold- 
ing him,  and  said  : — 

"  *  Hadst  thou  been  my  son's  consort,  thou  wouldst  in  effect 
be  my  daughter-in-law  ! '    Thereupon  she  answered : — 

"  *  Truly  it  is  so,  by  law,  I  am  the  wife  of  thy  son  and  dearer 
to  him  than  his  life's  breath,  O  Bull  amongst  the  Rakshasas ;  he 
is  the  son  of  thy  brother  Vaishravana,  who  is  renowned  in  the 
Three  Worlds,  and  is  named  Nalakuvara,  an  ascetic  in  virtue,  a 
warrior  in  respect  of  valour  and,  in  wrath  he  resembles  Agni  j 
in  forbearance  he  is  like  unto  the  earth  !  I  was  going  to  meet  that 
son  of  the  Guardian  of  the  Worlds  ;  it  is  for  his  sake  that  I  am 
adorned  with  these  ornaments  so  that  he  and  no  other  should 
enjoy  me.  For  these  reasons,  let  me  go  hence,  O  King,  O 
Subduer  of  thy  Foes,  for  that  virtuous  prince  awaits  me  im- 
patiently. It  is  not  for  thee  to  thwart  his  desires,  let  me  go  !  Do 
thou  follow  the  path  of  the  virtuous,  O  Bull  among  the  Rak- 
shasas !  It  is  for  me  to  pay  thee  homage  and  for  thee  to  protect 
me) ' 

"  Thus  did  she  address  Dashagriva,  who  answered  her  in 
smooth  accents,  saying : — 

"  '  Thou  hast  said  thou  art  my  daughter-in-law !  For  those 
who  have  but  one  husband,  this  argument  is  valid  but  in 
Devaloka,  the  Gods  have  established  a  law  that  is  said  to  be 
eternal,  that  Apsaras  have  no  appointed  consorts  nor  are  the 
Gods  monogamous  I  * 

"  Thus  speaking,  the  Rakshasa,  who  had  stationed  himself  on 
the  mountain  ridge,  inflamed  with  desire,  ravished  Rambha  and, 
when  she  was  released  from  bis  embrace,  her  garlands  and  her 
465 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

ornaments  spoiled  and  torn  away,  she  resembled  a  river  where  a 
great  elephant,  disporting  himself,  muddying  the  waters,  has 
borne  away  the  banks.  Her  hair  in  disorder,  her  hands  clenched, 
like  unto  a  creeper  with  its  flowers  shaken  by  the  wind,  trembling 
with  terror,  she  sought  out  Nalakuvara  and,  with  joined  palms, 
fell  at  his  feet. 

"  Then  he  enquired  of  her  saying : — 

" '  What  is  this,  O  Blessed  One  ?  Why  dost  thou  prostrate 
thyself  at  my  feet  ?  * 

"  Thereupon  she,  sighing  deeply,  trembling,  with  joined 
palms  began  to  tell  him  everything  and  said  : — 

"  *  O  Lord,  this  night,  Dashagriva  scaled  the  Trivishtapa 
Peak  while  he  was  encamped  on  that  mountain  with  his  army  and 
I  was  observed  by  him  as  I  came  to  meet  thee,  O  Conqueror  of 
Thy  Foes  !  That  Rakshasa  seized  hold  of  me  and  questioned  me 
saying  "  To  whom  dost  thou  belong  ?  "  Then  I  told  him  all, 
verily  the  whole  truth,  but  he,  intoxicated  with  desire,  would 
not  listen  to  me  when  I  pleaded  with  him,  saying  "  I  am  thy 
daughter-in-law !  "  Refusing  to  listen  to  mine  entreaties,  he 
assaulted  me  ruthlessly  !  This  is  mine  only  fault,  0  Thou  of 
firm  vows,  thou  shouldst  therefore  pardon  me.  O  Friend,  verily 
there  is  no  equality  of  strength  between  man  and  woman  ! ' 

"  These  words  filled  the  son  of  Vaishravana  with  indignation 
and  hearing  of  this  supreme  outrage,  he  entered  into  meditation 
and  having  ascertained  the  truth,  the  son  of  Vaishravana,  his 
eyes  inflamed  with  anger,  instantly  took  water  in  his  hand  and 
sprinkled  his  whole  person  in  accord  with  tradition,  after  which 
he  pronounced  a  terrible  curse  on  that  Indra  of  the  Rakshasas, 
saying: — 

"  *  Since,  despite  thy  lack  of  love  for  him,  he  ravished  thee 
thus  brutally,  O  Blessed  One,  on  this  account  he  will  never  be 
able  to  approach  another  youthful  woman  unless  she  shares  his 
love ;  if,  carried  away  by  lust,  he  does  violence  to  any  woman  who 
does  not  love  him,  his  head  will  split  into  seven  pieces.' 

"  Having  uttered  this  curse  like  unto  a  scorching  flame, 
celestial  gongs  resounded  and  a  shower  of  flowers  fell  from  the 
sky.  All  the  Gods  with  the  Grandsire  at  their  head  were  filled 
with  joy,  conversant  as  they  were  with  the  whole  course  of  the 
world  and  the  future  death  of  the  Rakshasa. 
466 


UTTARA    KANDA 

"  When  Dashagriva  learnt  of  the  curse,  however,  his  hair 
stood  on  end  and  he  ceased  to  indulge  in  uniting  himself  with 
those  who  had  no  aifection  for  him.  Thereafter,  among  those 
who  had  been  borne  away  by  him  and  remained  faithful  to  their 
consorts,  there  was  great  rejoicing  when  they  beard  of  the  curse 
uttered  by  Nalakuvara,  which  was  pleasing  to  their  heart." 


CHAPTER    27 

The  Fight  between  the  Gods  and  the  Rakshasas.    The  Death  of 

Sumali 

"  Having  crossed  Mount  Kailasha  with  his  infantry  and  cavalry, 
the  extremely  powerful  Dashanana  reached  Indraloka  and,  like 
an  ocean  that  overflows,  the  tumult  of  the  Rakshasa  army, 
approaching  on  all  sides,  reverberated  in  Dcvaloka. 

"  Hearing  of  Ravana's  advent,  Indra  trembled  on  his  throne 
and  addressed  the  assembled  Gods,  Adityas,  Vasus,  Rudras, 
Sadhyas  and  Hosts  of  Maruts,  saying : — 

"  *  Prepare  to  fight  against  the  wicked-minded  Ravana  !  * 

"At  Shakra's  command,  the  Gods,  his  equals  in  war,  endowed 
with  great  valour,  boldly  armed  themselves  for  combat. 
Mahendra  however,  who  feared  Ravana  extremely,  profoundly 
perturbed,  sought  out  Vishnu  and  spoke  to  him  thus : — 

"  *  O  Vishnu,  how  shall  I  withstand  the  Rakshasa  Ravana, 
whose  strength  is  formidable  and  who,  alas,  is  advancing  to 
attack  me  ?  He  owes  his  power  to  the  boon  he  has  received  from 
Brahma  and  to  nought  else  and  the  words  uttered  by  that 
Lotus-born  God  must  be  carried  into  effect !  Do  Thou  grant  me 
such  assistance  again  which  Thou  didst  accord  me  when  I 
destroyed  Namuchi,  Vritra,  Bali,  Naraka  and  Shambara  !  O 
Lord,  O  God  of  Gods,  Slayer  of  Madhu,  there  is  no  refuge  save 
Thee  in  the  Three  Worlds  with  all  the  animate  and  inanimate 
beings.  Thou  art  the  blessed  Narayana,  the  eternal  lotus-born 
One ;  Thou  art  the  Sustainer  of  the  Worlds  and  of  myself, 
Shakra,  the  King  of  the  Gods ;  Thou  hast  created  the  Three 
Worlds  with  all  the  moving  and  unmoving  objects  and,  at  the 
end  of  the  world  cycle,  all  is  withdrawn  into  Thee,  O  Bhagawat ; 
467 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

therefore,  O  God  of  Gods,  tell  me  truly  if  Thou  wilt  arm  Thyself 
with  sword  and  discus  in  order  to  enter  into  combat  with 
Ravana?' 

"  Thus  spoke  Shakra,  the  King  of  the  Gods,  and  that  sovereign 
Lord,  Narayana,  answered  him  saying : — 

"  *  Fear  not !  Hear  me !  On  account  of  the  boon  he  has 
received  which  renders  him  invincible,  this  wicked  wretch  may 
not  be  overcome  by  the  Gods  and  Asuras  combined !  Intoxica- 
ted with  his  power,  that  Rakshasa,  accompanied  by  his  son,  will 
certainly  achieve  a  great  feat.  As  for  thy  request,  that  I  should 
enter  into  combat  with  him,  I  shall  certainly  not  meet  the  Rak- 
shasa Ravana  in  fight,  for  Vishnu  never  leaves  the  battlefield 
without  laying  his  adversary  low ;  it  is  not  possible  to  accomplish 
this  to-day  since  Ravana  is  protected  by  the  boon,  but  I  swear 
to  thee,  O  King  of  the  Gods,  Shatakratu,  that  I  myself  will  become 
the  cause  of  that  titan's  death.  The  Gods  shall  rejoice  when  I 
make  known  to  them  that  the  hour  has  struck  !  I  speak  the  truth, 
O  Mighty  Lord  of  the  Gods,  Consort  of  Sachi,  therefore  fight 
with  the  assistance  of  the  Gods  and  banish  all  fear  !  * 

"  Then  the  Rudras  with  the  Adityas,  Vasus,  Maruts  and  the 
two  Ashvins,  assembling,  advanced  to  meet  the  Rakshasa.  At 
that  instant,  the  end  of  the  night  having  come,  a  great  clamour 
arose  from  Ravana's  army  as  they  took  the  field  on  all  sides,  and 
those  valiant  warriors,  wrought  up  with  excitement,  on  seeing 
each  other,  eagerly  rushed  on  the  foe.  Thereafter  confusion 
was  sown  amongst  the  ranks  of  the  Daivatas  by  the  presence  of 
that  indomitable  and  vast  army  in  the  forefront  of  battle  and  a 
terrible  struggle  ensued  between  the  Gods,  Danavas  and 
Rakshasas,  amidst  a  fearful  tumult  and  under  a  hail  of  missiles 
of  every  kind. 

"  Then  those  valiant  Rakshasas  of  grim  aspect  grouped 
themselves  round  Ravana  in  the  fight,  and  Maricha,  Prahasta, 
Mahaparshwa,  Mahodara,  Akampana,  Nikumbha,  Shuka,  Sarana 
Dhumaketu,  Mahadamshtra,  Ghatodara,  Jambumalin,  Maharada 
Virupaksha,  Saptaghna,  Yajnakopa,  Durmukha,  Dushana, 
Khara,  Trishiras,  Karaviraksha,  Suryashastru,  Mahakaya  and 
Atikaya,  Devantaka,  Narantaka  and  the  highly  powerful  Suraali, 
Ravana's  maternal  grandfather,  all  those  warriors,  encircling 
their  valiant  leader,  entered  the  battlefield. 
468 


UTTARA    KANDA 

"And  with  whetted  shafts,  enraged,  he  began  to  assail  the 
Celestial  Host,  as  a  tempest  scatters  the  clouds ;  and  the  forces 
of  the  Gods  were  overthrown  by  the  rangers  of  the  night,  O 
Rama,  and  scattered  in  all  directions,  like  unto  a  herd  of  deer 
before  lions. 

"  Meantime  the  courageous  Savitra,  the  eighth  Vasu,  entered 
the  battlefield  surrounded  by  soldiers,  full  of  martial  ardour, 
furnished  with  every  kind  of  weapon  and  he  began  to  sow  terror 
in  the  enemy  ranks  when  he  appeared  in  the  midst  of  the  right. 
Thereafter  the  two  Adityas,  full  of  valour  and  intrepidity, 
Twastar  and  Pushan,  at  the  head  of  a  division,  entered  the  lists 
in  their  turn,  whereupon  a  fearful  struggle  ensued  between  the 
Rakshasas  and  the  Gods,  who  never  retreated  in  battle  and  were 
jealous  of  their  good  name.  And  the  Celestials  there  present  fell 
in  hundreds  of  thousands  under  the  blows  of  the  Rakshasas,  who 
were  formidable  and  armed  with  weapons  of  every  kind.  On 
their  side,  the  Gods,  redoubtable  in  their  vigour  and  extreme 
valour,  with  the  help  of  faultless  arrows,  despatched  their  foes 
to  the  region  of  Yama.  Thereupon  O  Rama,  the  Rakshasa 
Sumali,  fully  armed,  hurled  himself  on  the  foe  in  fury  and 
scattered  the  entire  Celestial  Host  with  his  innumerable  and 
penetrating  missiles,  as  a  violent  hurricane,  the  clouds,  and  with 
formidable  blows  from  spears  and  javelins,  decimated  them,  so 
that  the  Gods  were  unable  to  stand. 

"  The  Immortals  having  thus  been  put  to  flight  by  Sumali, 
the  eighth  Vasu,  Savitra,  enraged,  stood  fast,  and  surrounded  by 
his  forces,  full  of  energy  and  courage  stayed  the  onrush  of  that 
Ranger  of  the  Night,  whereupon  a  fearful  duel,  causing  the  hair 
to  stand  on  end,  ensued  between  Sumali  and  the  Vasu,  both 
warriors  who  did  not  know  what  it  was  to  retreat  in  battle. 
Under  the  powerful  missiles  of  his  adversary,  the  chariot  of  the 
Rakshasa,  that  was  harnessed  to  serpents,  suddenly  fell  to  pieces  ; 
and  having  shattered  his  chariot  in  the  fight  with  his  countless 
darts,  the  Vasu  seized  hold  of  his  mace  with  the  intention  of 
slaying  him.  Brandishing  that  weapon  with  its  flaming  point, 
resembling  the  Rod  of  Death,  Savitra  brought  it  down  on 
Sumali's  head  and  the  mace  fell  upon  him  with  the  flash  of  a 
meteor,  so  that  it  appeared  like  a  great  thunderbolt  hurled  by 
Indra  on  a  mountain.    Thereafter  nothing  of  the  Rakshasa 

2H  469 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

could  be  seen,  neither  bone  nor  head  nor  flesh,  for  that  mace, 
by  overthrowing  him  on  the  battle  field,  had  reduced  him  to  dust. 
"  Then  the  Rakshasas,  beholding  that  Sumali  had  fallen  in 
the  fight,  questioning  each  other,  all  fled,  routed  by  that  Vasu 
who  had  overcome  them." 


CHAPTER    28 

The  Duel  between  Indra  and  Ravana 

"  Seeing  Sumali  overthrown  and  reduced  to  dust  by  Vasu  and 
beholding  his  army  in  flight  harassed  by  the  Gods,  the  valiant 
son  of  Ravana,  whose  voice  resembled  the  muttering  of  a  thunder- 
cloud, provoked,  rallied  the  Rakshasas  and,  mounted  on  an 
excellent  chariot  that  coursed  wheresoere  he  willed,  that  great 
warrior  hurled  himself  on  the  Celestial  Host.  Like  unto  a  fire 
that  consumes  the  forests,  he  entered  the  field  armed  with  every 
weapon,  and  when  the  Gods  beheld  him,  a  general  stampede 
followed,  none  daring  to  face  such  a  combatant  Then  Shakra 
stayed  all  those  fugitives  by  admonishing  them  thus  : — 

"  '  Neither  should  you  tremble  nor  flee,  return  and  fight,  O 
Ye  Gods  !   Behold  my  son,  who  is  invincible,  entering  the  lists  I  * 

"At  that  moment  the  son  of  Shakra,  the  illustrious  God 
Jayanta,  mounted  on  his  chariot,  that  was  marvellously  construc- 
ted, turned  towards  the  battlefield.  Thereafter  the  Gods, 
surrounding  the  son  of  Sachi,  turned  back  to  fight  Ravani  and  a 
well-matched  contest  ensued  between  Gods  and  Rakshasas. 
Then  Ravani  loosed  his  golden  shafts  on  Gomukha,  the  son  of 
Matali,  Jayanta's  charioteer,  whilst  Sachi's  son,  in  his  turn, 
in  wrath  harassed  Ravani's  driver  on  every  side.  His  eyes 
dilated  with  the  fury  that  possessed  him,  the  mighty  Ravani 
covered  his  opponents  with  darts  and  thereafter,  in  his  ire,  he  let 
fly  innumerable  extremely  sharp  weapons  on  the  Celestial  Host 
and  Shataghnis,  pikes,  javelins,  maces,  swords,  axes  and  huge 
crags  were  all  discharged  by  him  upon  them.  Then  the  worlds 
became  agitated  and  while  Indrajita  decimated  the  enemy 
battalions  the  quarters  were  enveloped  in  darkness. 

"  Meanwhile  the  army  of  the  Gods  deserted  Jayanta  and,  in 
470 


UTTARA    KANDA 

confusion  broke  their  ranks,  being  overwhelmed  by  the  shafts 
of  their  rival. 

"  Rakshasas  and  Gods  could  not  distinguish  each  other  and 
the  forces  thrown  into  disorder  on  every  side,  fled  in  all  directions. 

"  The  Gods  struck  the  Gods  and  the  Rakshasas  the  Rakshasas, 
bewildered  by  the  darkness  that  enveloped  them,  whilst  others 
ran  away.  At  that  instant,  a  warrior,  full  of  valour,  named 
Puloman,  the  foremost  of  the  Daityas,  seized  Jayanta  and  bore 
him  away.  Taking  hold  of  his  daughter's  son,  he  dived  into  the 
sea  for  he  was  his  maternal  grandfather  and  Sachi's  sire. 

"  Learning  of  Jayanta's  disappearance,  the  Gods,  cast  down 
and  discouraged,  dispersed.  Then  Ravani,  enraged,  emitting 
loud  cries,  surrounded  by  his  forces  rushed  on  the  Gods. 

"  Not  beholding  his  son  and  observing  the  flight  of  the  Gods, 
the  Lord  of  the  Celestials  said  to  Matali : — '  Bring  me  my 
chariot ! '  and  Matali  harnessed  the  divine,  powerful  and  huge 
car,  bringing  it  in  all  haste  to  his  master.  Thereupon,  above  the 
chariot  and  before  him,  clouds,  riven  by  lightning,  driven  by  the 
tempest  emitted  formidable  mutterings  and  the  Gandharvas 
struck  up  every  kind  of  musical  instrument  while  troops  of 
Apsaras  danced  at  the  departure  of  the  King  of  the  Gods,  and 
Rudras,  Vasus,  Adityas,  the  two  Ashvins,  as  also  the  Hosts  of 
the  Maruts,  armed  with  every  kind  of  weapon,  formed  the  escort 
of  the  Lord  of  the  Thirty,  as  he  started  out. 

"As  Shakra  advanced,  a  bitter  wind  blew,  the  sun  ceased  to 
shine  and  a  great  meteor  fell.  At  the  same  time,  the  courageous 
Dashagriva,  burning  with  ardour,  himself  ascended  the  divine 
Fushpaka  Car  constructed  by  Vishvakarma  and  harnessed  to 
huge  serpents,  who,  as  it  were  causing  the  hair  to  stand  on  end, 
consumed  everything  with  the  wind  of  their  breath. 

"  Daityas  and  titans  surrounded  the  celestial  car  that  was 
rolling  towards  the  field  of  battle,  advancing  to  meet  Mahendra, 
and  Dashagriva,  having  dismissed  his  son,  took  his  place 
himself,  whilst  Ravani  left  the  field  and  remained  a  tranquil 
witness. 

"  Then  the  struggle  was  resumed  between  the  Rakshasas  and 

the  Gods,  who  like  unto  clouds,  caused  a  shower  of  missiles  to 

fall  in  the  fight.    And  the  wicked  Kumbhakama,  brandishing 

weapons  of  every  kind,  came  there,  O  Ring,  unaware  with  whom 

47i 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  conflict  was  taking  place ;  using  his  teeth,  his  feet,  his  hands, 
lances,  picks,  mallets  or  anything  whatsoever  in  order  to  assail 
the  Gods  in  his  fury.  Having  attacked  the  formidable  Rudras, 
it  went  ill  with  that  Ranger  of  the  Night,  who,  in  an  instant,  was 
riddled  with  wounds ;  and  the  army  of  the  Rakshasas,  hard 
pressed  by  the  Gods,  assisted  by  the  Hosts  of  Maruts  and  armed 
with  every  weapon,  were  completely  routed  and,  in  the  struggle, 
some  fell  on  the  earth  mutilated  and  palpitating,  whilst  others 
remained  clinging  to  their  mounts.  Some  titans  twined  their 
arms  round  their  chariots,  elephants,  donkeys,  buffalo,  serpents, 
horses,  porpoise  and  boars  with  heads  of  goblins,  where  they  lay 
motionless,  whereupon  the  Gods  pierced  them  with  their  shafts 
and  thus  they  died.  The  sight  of  all  those  Rakshasas  lying  here 
and  there  in  the  sleep  of  death  on  that  vast  battlefield  looked 
passing  strange  and,  at  the  forefront  of  the  battle,  a  river  flowed, 
blood  being  its  waters,  weapons  its  crocodiles,  in  which  vultures 
and  crows  abounded. 

"  Meantime  Dashagriva,  seething  with  anger  on  seeing  his 
army  entirely  overthrown  by  the  Gods,  hurled  himself  with  one 
bound  into  that  sea  of  warriors,  slaving  the  Celestials  in  the 
fight  and  challenging  Shakra  himself. 

"  Thereupon  Shakra  stretched  his  great  bow  that  gave  forth  a 
thunderous  noise  and,  when  he  drew  it,  the  twanging  of  that 
weapon  caused  the  quarters  to  resound.  Then  Indra,  bending 
that  great  bow,  let  fall  his  naming  arrows  like  unto  fire  or  the 
sun  on  Havana's  head  and,  on  his  side,  that  powerful  titan 
covered  his  rival  with  a  hail  of  arrows  loosed  from  his  bow  and 
both  showered  down  missiles  on  every  side  so  that  nothing  could 
be  distinguished  and  the  whole  firmament  was  enveloped  in 
darkness." 


CHAPTER    20 

Ravani  takes  Indra  captive 

"  In  the  darkness  that  had  supervened,  the  Gods  and  the  Rak- 
shasas engaged  in  a  terrible  struggle,  slaying  each  other  in  the 
intoxication  of  their  strength  and,  in  the  obscurity  that  enveloped 
472 


UTTARA    KANDA 

diem  like  a  great  veil,  the  supremely  intrepid  Indra,  Ravana  and 
Mcghanada  alone  were  not  deluded. 

"  Beholding  that  army  wholly  annihilated,  Ravana  was 
suddenly  seized  with  violent  rage  and  emitted  a  great  roar.  In 
his  fury  that  invincible  warrior  addressed  his  driver,  who  stood 
near  with  the  chariot,  saying,  '  Take  me  through  the  enemy 
ranks  from  one  end  to  the  other !  This  very  day,  with  mine 
innumerable  and  powerful  weapons,  all  the  Gods  in  my  path 
will  be  despatched  by  me  to  the  region  of  Yama.  I  myself  shall 
slay  Indra,  Dhanada,  Varuna,  Yama  and  all  the  Gods  and  shall 
soon  strike  them  down  and  trample  them  under  my  feet.  Do 
not  delay,  drive  the  car  on  speedily,  and  again  I  say  to  thee, 
"  Drive  through  the  enemy  ranks  from  end  to  end  !  We  are  now 
in  the  Nandana  Gardens  therefore  take  me  to  the  Udaya 
Mountain ! "  * 

"At  this  command,  the  charioteer  drove  his  steeds,  who  were 
as  swift  as  thought,  through  the  enemy  ranks. 

"  Divining  Ravana's  intention,  Shakra,  standing  in  his  chariot 
on  the  battlefield,  addressed  the  Gods,  whose  sovereign  he  was, 
saying: — 

"'OYc  Gods,  hear  me,  this  is  what  I  consider  expedient — 
Dashagriva  should  without  delay  be  captured  alive.  That 
extremely  powerful  Rakshasa  will  enter  our  ranks  in  his  chariot 
with  the  speed  of  the  wind,  like  unto  an  ocean  whose  waves  are 
overflowing  on  the  day  of  high  tide.  He  may  not  be  slain  for 
a  special  boon  protects  him  but  seek  to  make  him  captive  in  the 
struggle  !  It  was  by  taking  Bali  prisoner  that  I  was  able  to  enjoy 
the  Three  Worlds ;  for  this  reason  let  us  do  the  same  to  this 
wicked  wretch.' 

"  Thus  speaking,  Shakra  left  Ravana  and  went  to  another  part 
of  the  field,  sowing  terror  among  the  Rakshasas  whom  he  assailed, 
O  Great  King. 

"While  the  indefatigable  Dashagriva  went  to  the  left, 
Shatakratu  penetrated  the  right  wing  of  his  adversary's  forces. 
Having  advanced  a  hundred  leagues,  the  King  of  the  Rakshasas 
covered  the  entire  Host  of  the  Gods  with  a  shower  of 
arrows. 

"  Seeing  the  carnage  that  was  being  created  in  his  army,  the 
intrepid  Shakra  stayed  Dashanana  by  encircling  him,  whereupon 
473 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  Danavas  and  Rakshasas  beholding  Ravana  overcome  by 
Shakra,  cried  out '  Alas !    We  are  lost !  * 

"  Standing  in  his  chariot,  Ravani,  who  was  transported  with 
rage,  penetrated  into  the  ranks  of  the  redoubtable  Celestial  Host 
and  routed  the  army  by  resorting  to  the  power  of  illusion  that 
had  been  conferred  on  him  by  Pashupati.  Then,  leaving  the 
Gods  aside,  he  rushed  on  Shakra  himself,  and  the  highly 
energetic  Mahendra  did  not  observe  the  son  of  his  adversary. 
The  Gods,  however,  whose  strength  was  immeasurable,  severed 
Ravani's  armour,  even  wounding  him,  but  he  remained  unper- 
turbed and  with  his  excellent  shafts  pierced  Matali  who  was 
advancing  towards  him,  covering  Mahendra  afresh  with  a  hail  of 
missiles. 

"  Thereupon  Shakra  descended  from  his  chariot  dismissing 
his  charioteer,  and  mounting  Airavata,  he  pursued  Ravani,  who 
had  made  himself  invisible  through  his  magic  power,  but  he, 
springing  into  the  sky,  assailed  him  with  arrows.  Seeing  that 
Indra  was  exhausted,  Ravani  bound  him  by  his  magic  and  led 
him  to  the  side  where  his  own  army  was.  Beholding  Mahendra 
borne  away  by  force  from  the  fight,  all  the  Celestials  enquired 
*  What  has  taken  place  ?  One  cannot  discern  the  magician  who 
has  triumphed  over  Shakra,  that  victorious  warrior,  who,  by  the 
aid  of  magic,  has  carried  Indra  away  despite  his  skill.'  Then  all 
the  divisions  of  the  Gods,  in  their  wrath,  overwhelmed  Ravana 
with  a  hail  of  shafts  and  forced  him  to  retreat,  whilst  he,  worn 
out  in  the  encounter  with  the  Adityas  and  the  Vasus  was  unable 
to  continue  the  fight. 

"  Beholding  his  sire  harassed  and  assailed  with  shafts  in  the 
encounter,  Ravani,  remaining  invisible  in  the  struggle,  said  to 
him : — 

"  '  Come,  O  Dear  Father,  let  us  give  up  the  fight,  know  that 
victory  has  been  obtained,  therefore  abandon  thy  feverish  activity! 
The  King  of  the  Gods  and  of  the  Three  Worlds  has  been  taken 
captive !  The  Gods  have  seen  the  pride,  which  inspired  their 
forces,  humbled.  Enjoy  the  Three  Worlds  at  thy  pleasure, 
having  overcome  the  foe  by  thy  valour,  why  fatigue  thyself 
further  with  combat  ?  * 

"  Hearing  Ravani's  words,  the  battalions  of  the  Gods  and  the 
Immortals  deprived  of  Shakra,  who  had  led  them,  gave  up  the 
474 


UTTARA    KANDA 

fight.  And  die  all-powerfiil  enemy  of  the  Gods,  the  illustrious 
Sovereign  of  the  Rakshasas,  thus  entreated  to  cease  from  further 
fighting  by  his  son,  whose  dear  voice  he  recognized,  answered 
him  with  deference,  saying : — 

"  *  Thy  valour  is  equal  to  the  greatest  of  heroes,  thou  in  whom 
my  family  and  race  find  their  increase,  O  Prince,  since  this  day 
thou  hast  overcome  the  one  whose  strength  is  immeasurable,  he, 
the  Sovereign  of  the  Gods.  Ascend  Vasava's  chariot  and  pro- 
ceed towards  the  city  with  thine  army  as  an  escort ;  I,  on  my 
side,  with  my  companions,  will  follow  joyfully  with  all  speed.' 

"  On  this  the  valiant  Ravani,  surrounded  by  his  forces  with 
the  Chief  of  the  Gods  in  chains,  set  out  towards  his  abode, 
thereafter  dismissing  the  Rakshasas  who  had  fought  in  the 
campaign." 

CHAPTER   30 

Telling  of  the  Curse  pronounced  by  the  Sage  Gautama  on  Shakra 

"  When  the  all-powerful  Mahendra  had  been  overcome  by  the 
son  of  Ravana,  the  Gods  with  Prajapati  at  their  head  went  to 
Lanka  and,  approaching  Dashagriva,  who  was  surrounded  by 
his  brothers,  Prajapati,  from  the  sky  where  he  was  stationed, 
addressed  him  in  conciliatory  tones,  saying : — 

"  '  My  Dear  Ravana,  I  am  pleased  with  thy  son's  bearing  on 
the  battlefield !  Assuredly  in  valour  and  heroism,  he  is  thine 
equal  if  not  thy  superior !  Thou  hast  overcome  the  Three 
Worlds  by  thy  prowess  and  fulfilled  thy  vow ;  I  am  gratified 
with  thee  and  thy  son.  He,  standing  there  full  of  strength  and 
energy,  will  become  renowned  in  the  worlds  under  the  name  of 
Indrajita1  and  that  Rakshasa,  with  whose  support  the  Gods  have 
been  brought  under  thy  subjection,  shall  become  powerful  and 
invincible.  O  Long-armed  Hero,  do  thou  release  Mahendra, 
the  Chastiser  of  Paka  and  say  what  the  inhabitants  of  heaven  shall 
bestow  on  thee  as  ransom  ? ' 
"  Then  that  victorious  warrior,  Indrajita,  answered  saying: — 
"  *  O  Lord,  if  that  God  is  to  be  set  free,  then  grant  mc 
immortality !  * 

1  Conqueror  of  Xndra. 

475 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Thereupon  the  all-powerful  Prajapati  replied  to  Meghanada, 
saying: — 

"  *  There  is  none  immortal  on  earth,  whether  it  be  beast,  bird 
or  any  other  mighty  being.' 

"  Hearing  this  irrevocable  decree  of  the  Grandsire,  the  Lord, 
Indra's  vanquisher,  the  courageous  Meghanada,  said  to  him : — 

"  '  Then  hear  me ,  and  may  it  come  to  pass  in  this  wise  on 
the  release  of  Shatakratu !  This  is  my  desire,  I,  who  constantly 
worship  Pavaka  with  oblations  and  mantras  and  who  delight  in 
fighting  and  overcoming  my  foes,  let  the  chariot  of  Vibhabasu 
harnessed  to  steeds,  be  placed  at  my  service  and  may  death  be 
unable  to  strike  me  down  when  I  am  mounted  upon  it !  This 
is  my  request,  but,  should  I  engage  in  combat  without  having 
completed  my  prayers  and  offered  my  oblations  to  the  God  of 
Fire,  then  may  I  perish  !  All,  O  Lord,  seek  immortality  by  means 
of  penances  ;  I  wish  to  acquire  immortality  through  valour  !  * 

" '  Let  it  be  so  *  said  the  Blessed  Grandsire  and  thereafter 
Shakra  was  set  free  by  Indrajita  and  the  Gods  returned  to  their 
own  abode. 

"  Meantime,  O  Rama,  the  wretched  Indra,  his  glory  dimmed, 
his  heart  full  of  anxiety,  was  plunged  in  melancholy  and,  beholding 
him  in  that  plight,  the  Grandsire  enquired  of  him,  saying  : — 

"  '  O  Shatakratu,  didst  thou  not  formerly  commit  some  great 
sin  ?  O  Chief  of  the  Gods,  O  Lord,  when  in  my  wisdom  I 
created  men,  they  were  all  possessed  of  the  same  colour,  shape, 
language  and  appearance,  there  was  no  difference  between  them 
in  form  or  aspect,  nevertheless  my  mind  was  pre-occupied  when 
I  reflected  on  those  beings  and,  I  created  a  woman  as  distinct 
from  them,  modifying  each  of  the  male  characteristics.  Thus  I 
made  a  female,  who  on  occount  of  the  grace  of  her  limbs  became 
known  as  Ahalya ;  **  Hala  "  meaning  ugly,  from  which  "  Halya  " 
is  derived,  and  she  in  whom  "  Halya  "  does  not  appear  is  named 
Ahalya;  this  was  the  name  I  called  her.  When  I  fashioned  that 
woman,  O  Chief  of  the  Gods,  O  Bull  among  the  Celestials,  I 
reflected,  "  To  whom  shall  she  belong  ?  "  This  is  how,  O  Lord 
Shakra,  O  Destroyer  of  Cities,  thou  didst  come  to  know  this 
woman  and,  in  thine  heart,  being  the  Lord  of  the  Worlds,  thou 
didst  resolve  "  she  shall  be  mine  V 

"  *  Meantime  I  placed  her  under  the  protection  of  the 
476 


UTTARA    KANDA 

magnanimous  Gautama  and  he,  having  taken  care  of  her  for  many 
years,  gave  her  back  to  me,  whereupon  I,  having  tested  the 
absolute  self-control  of  that  illustrious  ascetic  and  recognizing 
the  height  of  his  austerity,  gave  her  to  him  in  wedlock.  That 
virtuous  and  renowned  Muni  was  gratified  with  her  company 
but  the  Gods  were  in  despair  because  she  had  been  given  to 
Gautama  and  thou,  enraged,  thy  heart  filled  with  desire,  went 
to  the  hermitage  of  the  Sage  and  beheld  the  woman  who  was  as 
radiant  as  a  flame  in  a  brazier,  whereupon  thou  didst  ravish  her 
in  the  heat  of  thy  passion.  Thereafter  thou  wert  observed  by 
that  high-born  Rishi  in  the  hermitage  and,  in  his  indignation, 
that  extremely  powerful  ascetic  cursed  thee,  due  to  which,  O 
King  of  the  Gods,  thou  hast  just  suffered  this  change  of  circum- 
stance.   And  that  ascetic  addressed  thee,  saying : — 

"  *  "  Since  thou  hast  wantonly  ravished  my  spouse,  O  Vasava, 
thou  shalt  fall  captive  to  thine  enemy  on  the  field  of  battle ! 
This  vile  passion  that  thou  hast  manifested,  O  Perverse  Wretch, 
will  undoubtedly  spread  among  men  and  women  and  whosoever 
shall  be  guilty  of  it  shall  bear  half  the  responsibility,  whilst  the 
other  half  shall  be  thine ;  nor  shall  thy  state  be  permanent,  for 
the  sovereignty  of  whoever  the  Gods  choose  as  their  King  shall 
not  endure ;  this  is  the  curse  I  pronounce  on  thee !  " 

"  *  Thus  spoke  Gautama  and  thereafter  he  reproached  his 
spouse,  and  that  exalted  ascetic  addressed  her,  saying : — 

"  * "  O  Shameless  One,  leave  my  hermitage !  Though  young 
and  lovely,  since  thou  art  inconstant,  thy  beauty  shall  no  longer 
belong  to  thee  alone  in  the  world  and  shall  assuredly  be  shared 
by  all  beings,  since  on  thine  account,  this  mischief  has  been 
perpetrated  by  Indra  !  From  now  on,  all  beings  shall  partake 
of  thy  beauty  !  '* 

"  '  Then  Ahalya  sought  to  propitiate  the  great  Rishi  Gautama, 
saying:— 

"  * "  It  was  in  ignorance  that  I  suffered  myself  to  be  seduced 
by  Indra,  O  Great  Ascetic,  for  he  assumed  thy  form,  nor  was  it 
by  giving  way  to  desire,  O  Rishi,  therefore  forgive  me,  it  is  thy 
duty ! " 
"  'At  these  words  of  Ahalya's,  Gautama  answered : — 
"  * "  In  the  House  of  Ikshvaku  there  will  be  born  a  mighty 
warrior  named  Rama,  renowned  in  the  universe  and  he  will 
477 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

repair  to  the  forest  for  the  sake  of  the  brahmins.  That  long- 
armed  hero  will  be  none  other  than  Vishnu  in  human  form ; 
thou  shalt  behold  him,  O  Blessed  One,  and,  seeing  him,  thou 
shalt  be  purified,  for  it  is  he  who  can  efface  the  sin  thou  hast 
committed.  Having  offered  him  the  traditional  hospitality,  thou 
shalt  return  to  me  once  again  and  we  shall  resume  our  common 
life,  O  Lady  of  fair  countenance !  " 

" c  Having  spoken  thus,  the  Rishi  re-entered  his  hermitage, 
while  his  consort  gave  herself  up  to  rigid  penances.  It  is  on 
account  of  this  Sage's  curse  that  all  this  has  taken  place ;  there- 
fore, O  Mighty  Hero,  call  to  mind  the  sin  thou  didst  commit. 
This  is  why  thou  didst  fall  a  victim  to  thy  foes,  O  Vasava,  and 
for  no  other  cause,  therefore,  with  thy  senses  fully  controlled, 
speedily  offer  up  a  sacrifice  to  Vishnu.  Purified  by  this  pro- 
pitiatory rite,  thou  shalt  return  to  the  Celestial  Region.  Thy 
son,  O  Lord,  did  not  perish  in  the  fight  but  was  borne  away  to  the 
ocean  by  his  maternal  grandfather.' 

"  Hearing  Brahma's  words,  Mahendra  undertook  a  sacrifice 
in  honour  of  Vishnu  and  thereafter  the  Lord  of  the  Gods 
ascended  to  heaven,  reigning  there  as  king. 

"  I  have  described  to  thee,  how  great  was  the  power  of 
Indrajita,  who  overcame  the  King  of  the  Gods,  how  much  more 
therefore  was  he  able  to  triumph  over  other  beings  !  " 

Hearing  these  words  of  Agastya,  Rama  and  Lakshmana  as 
also  the  monkeys  and  titans,  exclaimed  "  How  wonderful !  "  and 
Bibishana,  who  stood  at  Rama's  side,  said : — 

"  I  remember  that  remarkable  feat  now,  I  was  formerly 
witness  thereof." 

Then  Rama  addressed  Agastya  saying : — "All  thou  hast  said 
is  true ! " 

"  This,  O  Rama,  is  the  narrative  of  the  origin  and  progress  of 
Ravana,  the  thorn  in  the  side  of  the  worlds,  who,  like  his  son, 
bore  away  Shakra,  the  King  of  the  Gods,  in  the  fight." 


478 


UTTARA    KANDA 

CHAPTER    31 

Ravana  goes  to  the  Banks  of  the  Narmada  River 

The  all-powerful  Rama,  in  his  astonishment,  bowed  low  to  that 
excellent  Rishi  Agastya  and  again  enquired  of  him,  saying : — 

"  O  Blessed  One,  O  Best  of  the  Twice-born,  when  that  cruel 
Rakshasa  began  to  range  the  earth,  were  the  worlds  bereft  of 
warriors  ?  Was  there  no  prince,  no  being,  able  to  oppose  him, 
since  that  Lord  of  the  Titans  met  with  no  resistance,  or  had  the 
rulers  of  the  worlds  lost  their  power  or  were  the  many  kings  he 
overcame,  without  weapons  ?  " 

Having  listened  to  the  words  of  that  son  of  Raghu,  the  blessed 
Sage  answered  him  smiling,  as  the  Grandsire  of  the  World 
addresses  Rudra,  and  said  :— 

"  It  was  destroying  the  rulers  thus  that  Ravana  ranged  the 
earth  and,  O  Rama,  Lord  of  the  Worlds,  he  came  to  the  city  of 
Mahishmati  which  rivalled  that  of  the  Gods,  where  the  Deity  of 
Fire  dwelt  perpetually.  There  a  monarch  reigned,  named 
Arjuna,  in  effulgence  like  unto  the  fire  which  was  kept  there  ever 
concealed  in  a  pit  covered  by  reeds.1 

"  On  that  day,  the  powerful  Sovereign  of  the  Haihayas,  Lord 
Arjuna  went  to  the  River  Narmada  to  sport  with  his  wives  and 
at  that  time,  Ravana  approached  Mahishmati  and  that  Indra 
among  the  Rakshasas  enquired  of  the  King's  counsellors, 
saying: — 

"  '  Tell  me  quickly,  where  is  the  Lord  Arjuna,  speak  truly  j  I 
am  Ravana  who  have  come  to  measure  my  strength  with  that 
most  powerful  of  monarchs.  Do  you  announce  mine  arrival  to 
him ! ' 

"  Hearing  Ravana's  words,  the  sagacious  ministers  informed 
the  King  of  the  Rakshasas  of  the  absence  of  their  sovereign  and 
the  son  of  Vishravas  learning  from  the  people  of  the  city  that 
Arjuna  had  departed,  went  away  in  the  direction  of  the  Vindhya 
Range,  which  like  unto  a  cloud  floating  in  space,  appeared  to 
him  to  resemble  Himavat  and,  springing  from  the  earth,  it 

1  Agni  Kundft— A  pit  or  hole  in  the  ground  where  the  sacred  fire  is  kept. 
479 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

seemed  to  lid:  the  skies  and  was  possessed  of  a  myriad  peaks. 
Lions  frequented  its  caverns  whilst  its  crystalline  cataracts, 
falling  over  the  cliffs,  resounded  like  peals  of  laughter,  and  Gods, 
Gandharvas  as  also  the  Apsaras  and  Kinneras  with  their  consorts, 
disporting  themselves  there,  transformed  it  into  a  paradise.  Its 
rivers  flowed  in  translucent  waves  and  that  Vindhya  Range,  like 
unto  Himavat,  with  its  peaks  and  caves  resembled  Shesha  with 
his  hoods,  his  tongues  darting  forth. 

"  Gazing  upon  it,  Ravana  reached  the  Narmada  River,  whose 
pure  waters  flowed  over  a  bed  of  stones  and  which  emptied 
itself  into  the  western  sea.  Buffalo,  Srimaras,  lions,  tigers, 
bears  and  elephants,  tormented  by  heat  and  thirst,  agitated  the 
waters,  whilst  Chakravakas,  Kavandas,  Hamsas,  Sarasas  and 
other  waterfowl,  with  their  impassioned  warbling,  abounded 
there.  The  flowering  trees  formed  its  diadem,  the  pairs  of 
Chakravaka  birds  its  breasts,  the  banks  of  sand  its  thighs,  the 
flocks  of  swans  its  bright  girdle ;  the  pollen  of  the  flowers 
powdered  its  limbs,  the  foam  of  the  waves  was  its  immaculate 
robe ;  sweet  was  its  contact  for  whoever  entered  it  and  it  was 
lovely  to  look  upon,  with  its  flowering  lotuses. 

"  Dismounting  from  the  Chariot  Pushpaka,  close  to  the 
Narmada,  that  most  beautiful  of  streams,  Dashanana,  a  bull 
among  titans,  accompanied  by  his  ministers,  went  towards  it  as 
towards  a  lovely  and  attractive  woman  and  seated  himself  on  the 
enchanting  sandy  banks  that  were  frequented  by  Sages. 

"  Beholding  the  Narmada,  the  ten-necked  Ravana,  transported 
with  delight,  exclaimed  '  It  is  the  Ganges  herself ! '  Thereafter 
he  addressed  his  ministers  Shuka  and  Sarana  and  others, 
saying: — 

"  *  Surya  of  a  thousand  rays  seems  to  have  changed  the  world 
to  gold  and,  in  the  sky,  that  orb  of  the  day  whose  beams  were  just 
now  intense,  having  observed  me  seated  here,  has  grown  as  cool 
as  the  moon.  Anila,  who,  refreshed  by  the  waters  of  the  Narmada, 
inspired  by  fear  of  me,  blows  softly  diffusing  a  sweet  perfume, 
that  marvellous  stream,  the  Narmada,  increaser  of  felicity,  in 
whose  waters  crocodile,  fish  and  birds  abound,  appears  like  a 
timid  girl.  You  who  were  wounded  by  the  weapons  of  kings 
equal  to  Shakra  in  combat  and  who  were  covered  with  blood 
like  unto  the  sap  of  the  Sandal  Tree,  now  plunge  into  the 
480 


UTTARA    KANDA 

beautiful  and  hospitable  Narmada  as  elephants  intoxicated  with 
ichor  and  led  by  Sarvabhauma  immerse  themselves  in  the 
Ganges.  Bathing  in  that  great  river  will  free  you  from  all  ills  ! 
As  for  me,  I  shall  presently  offer  up  flowers  in  tranquillity  to 
Kapardin  on  this  sandy  bank  that  shines  like  the  autumn  moon.' 

"  Hearing  these  words  of  Ravana,  Prahasta,  Shuka  and  Sarana 
with  Mahodara  and  Dhumraksha  dived  into  the  Narmada  River 
and,  agitated  by  those  titan  leaders  resembling  elephants,  the 
stream  appeared  like  unto  the  Ganges  when  Vamana,  Anjana, 
Padma  and  other  great  tuskers  disport  themselves  therein. 

"  Thereafter,  emerging  from  the  waters,  those  highly  powerful 
Rakshasas  soon  gathered  heaps  of  flowers  that  they  placed  on  the 
sandy  bank,  whose  enchanting  radiance  rivalled  that  of  a  dazzling 
cloud  and,  in  a  moment,  those  titans  had  heaped  up  a  mountain 
of  flowers,  whereupon  the  King  of  the  Rakshasas  entered  the 
river  to  bathe,  like  unto  a  great  tusker  entering  the  Ganges. 

"  Having  bathed  and  recited  the  most  excellent  of  prayers 
according  to  tradition,  Ravana  emerged  from  the  waters  and 
divested  himself  of  his  wet  garments,  clothing  himself  in  a 
white  robe.  Then  the  Rakshasas  followed  their  king,  who 
advanced  with  joined  palms,  so  that  they  appeared  like  moving 
hills.  Wherever  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas  went,  a  golden 
Shiva-Linga  was  borne  before  him  and  he  placed  it  on  a  sandy 
altar  and  worshipped  it  with  flowers,  perfumes  and  sandal- 
paste  Having  paid  homage  to  that  symbol  that  delivers  all  beings 
from  their  sufferings  and  which  was  large  and  exceedingly 
beautiful,  adorned  with  a  crescent  moon,  that  Ranger  of  the 
Night,  with  uplifted  arms,  danced  and  sang  before  it."

Arjuna  captures  Ravana 

"  Not  far  from  where  the  dread  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas  was 
making  his  offering  of  flowers  on  the  sandy  banks  of  the  Narmada, 
Arjuna,  the  foremost  of  conquerors,  supreme  sovereign  of 
Mahishmati,  was  sporting  with  his  wives  in  the  waters  of  that 
481 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

river.  In  their  midst,  that  monarch  looked  like  a  great  tusker 
surrounded  by  innumerable  female  elephants.  Then  he, 
desiring  to  measure  the  great  strength  of  his  thousand  arms, 
stayed  the  rapid  course  of  the  Narmada  and,  the  waters  thus 
arrested  by  the  myriad  arms  of  Kartavirya,  flowed  towards  its 
source  bearing  away  its  banks.  With  its  fishes,  crocodiles  and 
sharks,  its  carpet  of  flowers  and  Kusha  Grass,  the  current  of  the 
Narmada  grew  turbulent,  as  in  the  rainy  season,  and,  as  if 
purposely  released  by  Kartavirya,  that  flood  bore  away  all 
Ravana's  floral  offerings,  whereupon  he,  leaving  the  sacrifice 
only  half  performed,  cast  his  glance  on  the  river  that  appeared 
to  him  to  resemble  a  cherished  consort  who  is  overwrought. 

"  Having  surveyed  the  waters  rising  like  waves  in  the  sea, 
rushing  from  the  west  to  overwhelm  the  eastern  shore,  Ravana 
observed  that,  in  a  little  while,  the  birds  no  longer  shunned  it 
and  it  had  returned  to  its  natural  state,  like  a  woman  who  is 
pacified. 

M  Pointing  with  the  finger  of  his  right  hand,  Dashagriva 
signalled  to  Shuka  and  Sarana  that  they  should  seek  out  the 
cause  of  the  rising  current  and,  at  this  command  from  their 
king,  the  two  brothers,  Shuka  and  Sarana  rose  into  the  air  and 
turned  westward.  Having  traversed  two  miles,  those  Night- 
rangers  observed  a  man  in  the  river  sporting  with  some  women 
and  he  resembled  a  huge  Sala  Tree,  his  hair  floating  in  the  stream 
and  the  corners  of  bis  eyes  were  inflamed  by  the  desire  which 
agitated  his  heart.  And  that  Scourge  of  his  Foes  blocked  the 
river  with  his  myriad  arms,  as  a  mountain  the  earth  with  its 
countless  slopes  and  foot-hills,  and  innumerable  fair  women 
surrounded  him,  as  a  tusker  in  rut  is  encircled  by  female  elephants. 

"  Beholding  that  prodigious  sight,  the  two  Rakshasas,  Shuka 
and  Sarana  returned  together  to  Ravana  and  said  to  him : — 

"  *  O  Prince  of  the  Rakshasas,  an  unknown  person,  like  unto 
an  enormous  Sala  Tree,  in  order  to  amuse  his  consorts,  is 
staying  the  course  of  the  Narmada  like  a  dyke.  Restrained  by 
his  myriad  arms,  the  river  is  throwing  up  great  waves  like  unto 
die  seal* 

"  Hearing  these  words  from  Shuka  and  Sarana,  Ravana  said, 
'  It  is  Arjuna '  and  rushed  away,  eager  to  enter  into  combat  with 
him.   And,  as  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  set  forth  to 
482 


UTTARA    KANDA 

meet  Arjuna,  a  fierce  dust  storm  arose  accompanied  by  muttering 
clouds  raining  drops  of  blood  and  that  Indra  among  the  Rak- 
shasas,  escorted  by  Mahodara,  Mahaparshwa,  Dnumraksha, 
Shuka  and  Sarana,  proceeded  in  the  direction  where  Arjuna  was. 
Soon  that  mighty  Rakshasa,  of  the  hue  of  antimony,  reached  the 
waters  of  the  Narmada  and  there,  surrounded  by  his  wives,  as  a 
tusker  by  female  elephants,  the  foremost  of  monarchs,  Arjuna 
appeared  before  him.  Then  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  who  was 
intoxicated  with  power,  his  eyes  red  with  anger,  said  to  Arjuna's 
ministers  in  stentorian  tones  : — 

"  *  O  Counsellors  of  the  Lord  Haihaya,  inform  him  speedily 
that  he  who  is  called  Ravana  has  come  to  fight  with  him  !  * 

"  When  they  heard  these  words  of  Ravana,  Arjuna's  ministers 
raised  their  weapons  and  answered  him  saying : — 

"  '  O  Ravana,  thou  hast  indeed  chosen  an  excellent  moment 
for  combat !  Wouldst  thou  fight  a  prince  who  is  drunk  and  who 
is,  further,  amidst  his  consorts  ?  Dost  thou  really  desire  to  fight 
with  our  king  whilst  he  is  surrounded  by  his  wives  ?  Possess 
thyself  in  patience  to-day,  O  Dashagriva,  and  when  the  night  is 
over,  if  thou  still  wishest  to  do  so,  then  challenge  Arjuna,  O  Dear 
Friend.  If,  however,  thou  art  bent  on  combat,  O  Thou  sated 
with  war,  then  overcome  us  here  and  thereafter  meet  Arjuna  and 
fight  with  him.' 

"  Then  Ravana's  ministers  slew  some  of  Arjuna's  counsellors 
and  devoured  them  avidly,  and  a  great  uproar  arose  on  the  banks 
of  the  Narmada,  from  the  followers  of  Arjuna  and  Ravana's 
ministers.  The  soldiers  of  the  King  of  the  Haihayas  assailed 
Ravana  and  his  ministers,  on  whom  they  hurled  themselves  with 
appalling  fury  with  arrows,  darts,  javelins  and  tridents  that 
pierced  like  lightning,  and  they  created  a  tumult  like  unto  the 
sea  with  its  crocodiles,  fish  and  sharks. 

"  Meanwhile  the  ministers  of  Ravana,  Prahasta,  Shuka  and 
Sarana,  enraged  and  full  of  valour,  decimated  the  army  of 
Kartavirya,  and  Arjuna's  followers,  mad  with  terror,  informed 
him  of  the  attack  by  Ravana  and  his  ministers. 

"  On  these  tidings,  Arjuna  addressed  the  concourse  of  women, 

saying : — *  Have  no  fear  *,  and  rushed  out  of  the  water,  like 

another  Pavaka  emitting  terrible  flames,  so  that  he  resembled  the 

Fire  of  Dissolution  at  the  end  of  the  World  Period.    Adorned 

483 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

with  bracelets  of  refined  gold,  he  at  once  seized  hold  of  a  mace 
and  hurled  himself  on  the  Rakshasas,  whom  he  dispersed  as  the 
sun  the  darkness.  With  his  arms,  Arjuna,  having  brandished 
the  huge  mace,  let  it  fell  with  the  force  of  Garuda's  flight. 

"  Then  Prahasta,  unshakeable,  like  unto  a  hill,  mace  in  hand, 
stood  barring  his  path,  like  unto  the  Vindhya  Range  obstructing 
the  sun,  and  he  hurled  that  dreadful  weapon  bound  with  copper, 
emitting  a  great  shout  like  unto  Antaka.  At  the  tip  of  the  pike, 
loosed  by  Prahasta's  hand,  a  brilliant  flame  appeared  like  the 
point  of  an  Ashoka  Tree  that  seemed  to  glow,  but  the  son  of 
Kritavirya,  Arjuna,  without  being  perturbed,  skilfully  deflected 
that  mace  that  was  falling  upon  him,  with  his  own  weapon.  Then 
the  supreme  Lord  of  the  Haihayas  hurled  himself  on  his  adversary 
with  bis  heavy  weapon  which  he  brandished  in  his  five  hundred 
arms. 

"  Struck  by  that  powerful  blow  of  the  mace,  Prahasta,  who  had 
confronted  him,  fell  like  a  mountain  that  has  been  riven  by 
Indra's  thunderbolt. 

"  Seeing  Prahasta  lying  there,  Marietta,  Shuka  and  Sarana,  as 
also  Mahodara  and  Dhumraksha  fled  from  the  battlefield. 

"  His  ministers  routed  and  Prahasta  struck  down,  Ravana 
threw  himself  on  Arjuna,  the  foremost  of  monarchs,  and  a 
formidable  duel  ensued  between  that  king  of  a  myriad  arms  and 
the  twenty-armed  Ravana  causing  the  hair  to  stand  on  end. 
Like  unto  two  oceans  that  overflow,  two  mountains  shaken  to 
their  foundations,  two  flaming  suns,  two  blazing  fires,  two 
elephants  intoxicated  with  their  own  strength,  two  bulls  fighting 
for  a  heifer,  two  muttering  clouds,  two  lions  proud  of  then- 
strength,  like  unto  Rudra  and  Kala  enraged,  so  did  the  Rakshasa 
and  the  King  Arjuna,  armed  with  maces,  assail  each  other  with 
fearful  blows.  Resembling  mountains,  able  to  withstand  the 
dreadful  lightning  strokes,  so  did  man  and  Rakshasa  endure  the 
blows  of  the  mace.  As  the  noise  of  thunder  creates  reverbera- 
tions, so  the  impact  of  those  weapons  resounded  in  every  quarter. 
Arjuna's  mace,  falling  on  his  opponent's  breast,  lent  it  the 
appearance  of  gold  or  a  cloud  illumined  by  lightning.  In  the 
same  way,  each  time  Ravana's  mace  fell  on  Arjuna's  breast,  it 
resembled  a  meteor  falling  on  a  high  mountain.  Neither  Arjuna 
nor  the  Sovereign  of  the  Rakshasas  wearied  in  the  struggle, 
484 


UTTARA    KANDA 

which  remained  undecided  as  formerly  the  duel  between  Bali 
and  Indra.  As  two  bulls  struggle  with  their  horns  or  two 
elephants  with  their  sharp  tusks,  so  did  those  two  most  valiant 
of  men  and  Rakshasas  fight.  Finally  Arjuna,  in  fury,  with  all  his 
strength  struck  the  huge  chest  of  Ravana  with  his  mace,  but, 
protected  by  the  armour  bestowed  on  him  by  Brahma  as  a  boon, 
that  weapon  was  rendered  impotent  and  fell  cloven  on  the  earth. 
Under  the  blow  dealt  by  Arjuna,  however,  Ravana  fell  back  a 
bow's  length  and  sank  down  groaning. 

"Perceiving  him  to  be  overcome,  Arjuna  immediately  rushed  on 
Dashagriva  and  seized  hold  of  him  as  Garuda  did  a  serpent.  With 
his  myriad  arms,  that  mighty  king  took  hold  of  Dashanana  and 
bound  him  as  Narayana  had  bound  Bali. 

"  Ravana,  having  been  made  captive,  all  the  Siddhas,  Char- 
anas  and  Devatas  cried  out,  '  Well  done !  Well  done !  *  and 
showered  flowers  on  Arjuna's  head.  As  a  tiger  who  has  captured 
a  gazelle  or  a  lion  an  elephant,  so  did  the  King  of  the  Haihayas 
emit  loud  roars  like  unto  a  cloud. 

"  Thereafter  the  night-ranger,  Prahasta,  having  recovered 
consciousness,  seeing  Dashanana  bound,  rushed  on  Arjuna  in 
fury  and  the  forces  of  the  Rakshasas  assailed  him  with  extreme 
violence  as,  at  the  end  of  the  hot  season,  the  rain-clouds  break 
over  the  ocean. 

"  '  Release  him  !  Release  him  1  *  they  cried  unceasingly, 
attacking  Arjuna  with  iron  bars  and  spears  but,  entirely  unmoved 
by  the  hail  of  weapons,  ere  they  could  reach  him,  the  intrepid 
King  of  the  Haihayas,  Scourge  of  bis  Foes,  speedily  took  hold  of 
those  projectiles  hurled  at  him  by  the  enemies  of  the  Gods,  and 
by  means  of  many  a  dreadful  and  irresistible  missile,  he  put  them 
to  flight  as  the  wind  disperses  the  clouds. 

"  Having  scattered  the  Rakshasas,  Arjuna,  the  son  of  Krita- 
virya,  surrounded  by  his  friends,  bearing  Ravana,  bound, 
returned  to  his  city.  Then  the  Twice-born  and  the  people 
scattered  flowers  and  rice  upon  him,  as  he  made  his  entry  into 
the  capital,  resembling  the  God  of  a  Thousand  Eyes  when  he 
captured  Bali."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    33 
Arjuna  releases  Ravana  on  the  request  of  Poulastya 

"Hearing  from  die  Gods  in  heaven  of  Ravana's  capture,  which 

resembled  the  binding  of  the  wind,  Poulastya,  despite  Ms  self- 
mastery,  was  moved  by  tender  affection  for  his  offspring  and 
approached  the  Lord  of  Mahishmati.  Entering  the  path  of  the 
wind,  whom  he  equalled  in  velocity,  that  Twice-born  One,  with 
the  swiftness  of  thought,  reached  the  City  of  Mahishmati  and, 
as  Brahma  enters  Indra's  capital,  he  penetrated  into  that  city 
that  resembled  Amaravati  and  was  full  of  prosperous  and 
cheerful  people. 

"  Walking  on  foot,  he  advanced  like  unto  the  sun  with  such 
effulgence  that  the  eye  could  scarcely  rest  upon  him  and, 
beholding  him,  the  inhabitants  hastened  to  inform  Arjuna. 

"  '  It  is  Poulastya  ',  said  that  Sovereign  of  the  Haihayas  on 
perceiving  him,  whereupon,  with  joined  palms,  he  touched  his 
forehead  in  salutation  as  he  went  forward  to  meet  the  ascetic. 
Like  Brihaspati  before  Shakra  so  did  the  Purohita  precede  the 
king,  bearing  the  Arghya  and  also  the  Madhuparka  offerings. 

"  Thereafter  the  Rishi  drew  near  like  unto  the  rising  sun,  and 
Arjuna,  deeply  moved  on  beholding  him,  paid  obeisance  to  him 
as  Indra  offers  reverence  to  Brahma.  Presenting  him  with  the 
Madhuparka,  a  cow,  and  water  wherewith  to  wash  his  feet,  as 
also  the  Arghya,  that  Indra  among  Monarchs  addressed  Poulas- 
tya in  a  voice  trembling  with  delight  and  said : — 

"  '  Since  I  behold  thee,  O  Thou  whose  sight  is  hard  to  obtain, 
to-day  Mahishmati  has  become  the  equal  of  Amaravati,  O 
Foremost  of  the  Twice-born  !  To-day  I  am  happy,  O  Lord, 
to-day,  my  desires  are  consummated ;  to-day  my  birth  is 
rendered  fruitful ;  to-day,  my  penance  has  been  blessed  since 
I  now  embrace  thy  two  feet  that  are  worshipped  by  the  Celestial 
Host.  Here  is  my  kingdom  and  here  my  sons  and  my  consorts 
at  thy  service ;  what  are  thy  commands  ?  ' 

"  Then  Poulastya,  having  enquired  concerning  his  welfare, 
the  discharge  of  his  duty  and  the  sacrificial  fires  and  his  offspring, 
said  to  the  Sovereign  of  the  Haihayas  :— 
486 


UTTARA    KANDA 

" '  O  Foremost  of  Kings,  whose  eyes  are  ss  large  as  lotus 
petals,  whose  face  shines  like  the  full  moon,  none  is  equal  to  thee 
in  strength  since  thou  hast  conquered  Dashagriva,  he,  before 
whom,  the  ocean  and  the  wind  are  stayed  and  remain  motionless 
in  fear,  he,  my  grandson  whom  thou  didst  make  captive  on  the 
battlefield,  who  till  now  was  invincible.  Thou  hast  swallowed 
bis  glory  and  rendered  thy  name  illustrious.  O  Dear  Friend,  on 
my  request,  now  release  Dashanana ! ' 

"  Thereupon  Arjuna,  without  uttering  a  word,  having  listened 
to  Poulastya's  appeal,  cheerfully  released  the  foremost  of  the 
Rakshasas  and,  having  set  that  enemy  of  the  Gods  free,  Arjuna 
honoured  him  with  jewels,  garlands  and  celestial  raiment  and 
contracted  an  alliance  with  him  in  the  presence  of  fire,  then, 
prostrating  himself  at  the  feet  of  Brahma's  son,1  he  returned  to 
his  abode. 

"  Thereafter  Poulastya  himself  dismissed  the  powerful  Lord 
of  the  Rakshasas  after  embracing  him  and  he,  having  received 
hospitality,  departed,  ashamed  at  his  defeat,  whilst  Poulastya, 
the  son  of  that  Grandsire  of  the  World,  he  the  foremost  of  Munis, 
who  had  just  delivered  Dashagriva,  returned  to  Brahma-loka. 

"  Thus,  despite  bis  immense  strength,  was  Ravana,  who  had 
been  defeated  by  Kartavirya,  released  at  Poulastya's  request. 
So  are  the  mighty  overcome  by  those  who  are  still  mightier  than 
they,  O  Thou,  who  increaseth  the  felicity  of  the  Raghavas  !  He 
who  desires  his  own  happiness  should  not  despise  his  adversaries. 

"  Meanwhile  the  Lord  of  those  eaters  of  flesh,  having  con- 
tracted a  friendship  with  that  thousand-armed  monarch,  began 
to  range  the  earth  full  of  arrogance,  overcoming  its  rulers." 


CHAPTER     34 

Bali  hangs  Ravana  on  his  Girdle 

"Released  by  Arjuna,  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas, 
unwearyingly  ranged  the  earth  and  whenever  he  heard  of  any  who 
was  possessed  of  extraordinary  strength,  whether  man  or  titan, 

1  Poulastya. 

487 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

in  his  arrogance  he  sought  him  out  in  order  to  provoke  him  to 
combat. 

"  One  day  he  came  to  the  city  of  Kishkindha  and  challenged 
King  Bali  of  the  golden  diadem.  There  he  found  the  kinsfolk 
of  that  monkey  only,  Tara,  her  father  Sushena  and  the  Lord 
Sugriva,  who  answered  that  belligerent  one,  who  had  just  come, 
saying : — 

"  '  O  King  of  the  Rakshasas,  Bali,  who  would  have  accepted 
thy  challenge,  is  not  here,  what  other  Plavamgama  is  able  to 
meet  thee  in  combat  ?  Bali  has  gone  to  the  four  oceans  to  per- 
form the  Sandhya  Ceremony,  O  Ravana,  he  will  soon  return, 
have  patience  awhile !  That  heap  of  bones,  white  as  conch 
shells,  belongs  to  those  who  desired  to  measure  their  strength  in 
combat  with  the  Lord  of  the  Vanaras,  O  Prince.  Even  hadst 
thou  sucked  the  nectar  of  immortality,  O  Ravana,  thy  meeting 
with  Bali  would  put  an  end  to  thine  existence.  O  Son  of  Vish- 
ravas,  look  upon  this  marvellous  universe  once  more  for  soon 
it  will  no  longer  be  possible  for  thee  to  do  so.  Since  thou  art  in 
haste  to  die,  however,  go  to  the  southern  sea  where  thou  wilt 
behold  Bali  who  resembles  the  Deity  of  Fire.' 

"  Thereupon,  having  inveighed  against  Tara  and  the  others, 
Ravana,  that  Ravana  of  the  Worlds,1  remounted  his  Chariot 
Fushpaka  and  drove  towards  the  southern  sea.  There  he  beheld 
Bali,  like  unto  a  mountain  of  gold,  absorbed  in  the  performance 
of  Sandhya. 

"  Descending  from  the  Fushpaka  Car,  Ravana  of  the  hue  of 
coUyrium,  stole  upon  Bali  silently  in  order  to  seize  him,  but 
by  chance,  he  was  observed  by  him  who  had  no  doubts  as  to  bis 
fell  design,  though  Bali  remained  unmoved  like  a  lion  in  the 
presence  of  a  hare  or  Garuda  before  a  serpent,  and  he  was  in  no 
wise  perturbed  by  Ravana  of  malevolent  intent. 

"  He  reflected,  *  This  is  Ravana,  who  with  malice  in  his  soul, 
approaches  in  order  to  seize  hold  of  me.  I  shall  hang  him  on  my 
girdle  and  go  to  the  three  other  oceans,  then  all  will  behold  mine 
adversary,  Dashagriva,  his  arms  and  limbs  and  his  raiment 
dangling,  hooked  to  my  side  like  a  snake  caught  by  Garuda.' 

"  Thinking  thus,  Bali  remained  there  reciting  his  Vedic 
Mantras  in  a  low  voice,  like  unto  the  King  of  the  Mountains. 

1  Ravana  meaning  "  Th«  One  who  causes  others  to  cry  out '. 

488 


UTTARA    KANDA 

Each  desiring  to  lay  hold  on  the  other,  in  the  pride  their  strength 
inspired  in  them,  the  Sovereign  of  the  Monkeys  and  the  Lord 
of  the  Rakshasas  sought  to  realise  their  design. 

"  Perceiving  by  the  sound  of  his  footsteps  that  Ravana  was 
about  to  place  his  hands  upon  him.  Bah",  though  his  back  was 
turned,  caught  hold  of  the  titan  as  Garuda  a  serpent  and,  having 
seized  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  hooked  him  to  his  girdle, 
thereupon  that  monkey,  with  one  bound,  sprang  into  the  air,  and 
though  lacerated  and  torn  by  his  nails,  Bali  carried  off  Ravana  as 
a  tempest  propels  a  cloud. 

"  Meantime  the  ministers  of  Dashanana,  whom  he  was  bearing 
away,  fell  upon  Bali  emitting  loud  cries  in  order  to  make  him 
release  him.  Pursued  by  them,  Bali,  in  his  aerial  course,  shone 
like  the  sun  that  is  followed  by  a  drift  of  clouds  in  space.  Those 
foremost  of  the  Rakshasas,  exhausted  by  the  wind  that  caused 
their  arms  and  thighs  to  shake,  were  stayed  in  their  course,  and 
the  mountains  themselves  made  way  for  Bali,  how  much  more 
those  who,  made  of  flesh  and  blood,  sought  to  survive.  With  a 
speed  impossible  to  flocks  of  birds,  that  Indra  among  monkeys, 
in  great  haste,  paid  obeisance  to  all  the  oceans  in  turn  and,  at 
dusk,  received  the  homage  of  all  winged  creatures  on  the  way,  he, 
the  foremost  among  them ;  thereafter  with  Ravana  he  finally 
reached  the  Western  Sea.  There  that  monkey  performed  the 
Sandhya  Ceremony  and,  having  bathed,  still  bearing  Dashanana, 
went  to  the  Northern  Sea.  Thereafter  that  great  monkey  with 
his  adversary  traversed  thousands  of  leagues,  swift  as  the  wind 
or  thought.  Having  observed  the  Sandhya  Ceremony  at  the 
Northern  Sea,  Bali,  carrying  Dashanana,  went  to  the  Eastern 
Sea.  There,  Vasavi,  the  Lord  of  the  Monkeys,  performed  his 
evening  devotions  and,  still  bearing  Ravana,  he  returned  to 
Kishkindha.  Having  performed  the  Sandhya  at  the  four  oceans, 
that  monkey,  weary  of  supporting  Ravana,  halted  in  a  wood  near 
Kishkindha  and  that  King  of  the  Monkeys,  unhooking  Ravana 
from  his  girdle,  with  a  mocking  laugh,  said : — *  Whence  art  thou  ?  * 

"  Greatly  astonished,  the  King  of  the  Rakshasas,  whose  eyes 
were  half-closed  with  fatigue,  addressed  the  Lord  of  the  Monkeys 
thus: — 

M  *  O  Foremost  of  Monkeys,  O  Thou  who  resemblest  Mahen- 
dra,  I  am  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  Ravana,  who  came  in  the 
489 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

hope  of  entering  into  combat  with  thee  and  here  I  am,  thy 
captive !  What  strength,  what  energy,  what  inner  power  has 
enabled  thee  to  bind  me  thus  without  fatigue  and  with  such 
speed,  O  Valiant  Monkey?  Assuredly  there  are  only  three 
beings  who  could  have  acted  thus,  the  mind,  the  wind  and 
Suparna.  Having  witnessed  thy  power,  O  Bull  among  Monkeys, 
in  the  presence  of  fire  I  wish  to  enter  into  an  alliance  of  sincere 
and  enduring  friendship  with  thee!  Consorts,  sons,  city, 
kingdom,  pleasures,  raiment  and  food  will  all  be  shared  by  us,  O 
King,  O  Foremost  of  the  Monkeys  !  * 

"  Thereupon,  lighting  a  fire,  monkey  and  titan  became  brothers 
and  embraced  each  other.  Gasping  hands,  the  monkey  and  the 
titan  joyfully  entered  Kishkindha,  like  unto  two  lions  into  a 
rocky  cavern.  Resembling  another  Sugriva,  Ravana  sojourned 
there  for  a  month  and  thereafter  his  ministers  desirous  of  over- 
coming the  Three  Worlds,  led  him  away. 

"  Thus  did  Ravana  act  with  Bali  formerly  and,  although 
humbled  by  him,  swore  to  be  his  brother  in  the  presence  of  fire. 
Bali's  strength  was  unequalled,  O  Rama,  it  was  immeasurable ; 
yet  thou  didst  consume  him  as  the  fire  a  cricket." 


CHAPTER    35 

The  Story  of  Hanuman's  Childhood 

Them  Rama  made  a  further  enquiry  of  that  Sage,  whose  hermi- 
tage was  in  the  southern  region  and,  paying  obeisance  to  him  in 
great  reverence,  with  joined  palms  addressed  him  in  pregnant 
terms,  saying : — 

"Assuredly  the  prowess  of  Bali  and  Ravana  was  incomparable, 
yet,  to  my  mind  at  least,  it  was  never  equal  to  Hanuman's ! 
Courage,  skill,  strength,  tenacity  of  purpose,  sagacity,  experience, 
energy  and  prowess  are  all  to  be  found  in  Hanuman  ! 

"  When  beholding  the  Ocean,  the  army  of  the  monkeys  was  in 

despair,  that  long-armed  hero  consoled  them,  traversing  a 

hundred  leagues  and  destroying  the  City  of  Lanka.    Entering 

Ravana's  inner  apartments,  he  discovered  Sita  and  encouraged 

490 


UTTARA    KANDA 

her  by  his  words.  Single-handed,  Hanuman  slew  those  who 
marched  at  the  head  of  the  enemy  forces,  the  sons  of  Ravana's 
ministers,  the  Kinkaras,  and  thereafter,  when  he  had  broken  his 
fetters  and  admonished  Dashanana,  he  reduced  Lanka  to  ashes 
as  Favaka  the  world.  Such  feats  were  never  surpassed  by  Indra, 
Varuna,  Vishnu  or  Kuvera.  By  the  might  of  his  arms,  I  have 
conquered  Lanka  and  regained  Sita,  Lakshmana,  my  kingdom, 
friends  and  kinsfolk.  Who  but  Hanuman,  the  companion  of  the 
King  of  the  Vanaras,  would  have  been  capable  of  obtaining 
tidings  of  Janaki  ?  But  how  comes  it,  that  in  his  devotion  to 
Sugriva,  he  did  not  consume  Bali  at  the  time  of  the  quarrel,  as  a 
fire  a  shrub  ?  It  seems  to  me  that  Hanuman  was  not  yet  aware 
of  his  powers  when  he  witnessed  the  King  of  the  Monkeys, 
whom  he  loved  as  his  own  being,  set  at  nought !  Recount  to  me 
in  detail  and  candidly  everything  concerning  Hanuman,  O 
Blessed  and  Illustrious  Ascetic,  O  Thou  whom  the  Gods 
revere ! *' 

Hearing  these  sagacious  words,  the  Sage,  in  Hanuman's 
presence,  answered : — 

"  What  thou  hast  said  regarding  Hanuman  is  true,  O  Prince 
of  the  Raghus !  I  deem  none  is  equal  to  him  in  strength  or 
surpasses  him  in  swiftness  and  intelligence  but  formerly  an 
irrevocable  curse  was  pronounced  on  him  by  the  Sages,  on 
account  of  which,  that  hero  was  made  unconscious  of  his  great 
power,  O  Scourge  of  thy  Foes. 

"  In  his  childhood,  O  Mighty  Rama,  he  did  something  of 
which  I  cannot  speak,  so  puerile  was  it,  but  if  thou  so  desirest,  O 
Raghava,  I  will  disclose  it  to  thee. 

"  There  is  a  mountain  named  Sumeru  that  Surya  gilds  as  a 
boon ;  there  Kesharin,  the  sire  of  Hanuman,  dwells.  Vayu 
begot  a  wonderful  child  on  his  cherished  and  illustrious  consort, 
Anjana,  and  she  brought  that  son,  whose  colour  was  like  unto  an 
ear  of  corn,  into  the  world.  Wishing  to  pluck  some  fruits,  that 
lovely  woman  penetrated  into  a  thicket,  and  the  child,  who  in  his 
mother's  absence  suffered  greatly  from  hunger,  began  to  emit 
piercing  cries,  like  unto  Karttikeya  in  the  Shara  Wood. 

"At  that  moment,  he  observed  the  sun  rising  like  unto  a  bunch 
of  Java  flowers,1  and,  eager  for  food,  he  imagined  it  to  be  a  fruit 

1  China  Roses 

491 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

and  rushed  towards  it.  Turning  to  the  rising  sun,  the  child, 
himself  like  unto  the  dawn,  wishing  to  lay  hold  of  it,  sprang  into 
the  sky.  And  Hanuman's  bounds,  he  being  but  a  child,  greatly 
astonished  the  Devas,  Danavas  and  Yakshas  who  reflected, 
*  Neither  Vayu,  Garuda  nor  even  thought  itself  have  the  velocity 
of  this  son  of  the  Wind  who  has  leapt  into  the  sky.  If,  whilst 
still  a  child,  the  speed  of  his  flight  is  such,  what  will  it  not  be 
when  he  attains  his  youthful  strength.* 

"  Now  Vayu  followed  in  his  son's  wake  lest  the  sun  should 
scorch  him  and  protected  him  with  his  cooling  breath.  Thus 
Hanuman,  rising  in  space,  traversed  thousands  of  leagues  and, 
on  account  of  his  sire's  power  and  his  own  guilelessness,  drew 
near  to  the  sun. 

"  *  That  litde  One  is  not  conscious  of  his  error  *  reflected 
Surya,  *  we  must  act  accordingly ',  and  he  refrained  from 
consuming  him. 

"  Now  on  that  very  day  that  Hanuman  sprang  into  the  sky  to 
seize  hold  of  the  solar  orb,  Rahu1  had  prepared  to  take  hold  of  it 
himself  and,  coming  in  contact  with  that  child  in  the  sun's 
chariot,  Rahu  sprang  away  in  fear,  he,  the  scourge  of  the  sun 
and  moon.  Provoked,  that  son  of  Simhika  went  to  Indra's 
abode  and,  scowling,  said  to  that  God,  who  was  surrounded  by 
the  Celestial  Host : — 

" '  O  Vasava,  in  order  to  satisfy  my  hunger,  thou  didst  bestow 
the  sun  and  moon  on  me,  why  hast  thou  made  a  present  of  them 
to  another,  O  Slayer  of  Bali  and  Vritra  ?  To-day,  which  is  the 
time  of  the  conjunction,  I  had  gone  to  lay  hold  of  the  sun  when 
another  Rahu  approached  and  seized  it.* 

"  Hearing  these  words  of  Rahu,  Vasava,  astonished,  rose  up 
from  his  throne  and  bearing  his  golden  diadem,  went  out. 
Thereafter  he  mounted  Airavata,  foremost  of  elephants,  who  was 
as  high  as  a  hill  or  the  peak  of  Mount  Kailasha  with  his  four 
tusks,  running  with  mada  juice,  enormous,  richly  caparisoned 
and  whose  golden  bells  rang  merrily. 

"  Then  Indra  commanded  Rahu  to  precede  him  and  directed 
his  course  to  where  Surya  and  Hanuman  were.  Thereupon 
Rahu  set  out  with  all  speed  leaving  Vasava  far  behind  and  the 
child,  Hanuman,  beheld  him  as  he  drew  near,  whereupon  he

492 


UTTARA    KANDA 

let  go  of  the  sun  and,  taking  Rahu  to  be  a  fruit,  once  more  bounded 
into  the  sky  to  seize  Simhika's  son. 

"  Observing  that  Plavamgama  loosing  his  hold  on  the  sun  in 
order  to  throw  himself  upon  him,  the  offspring  of  Simhika,  of 
whom  the  head  alone  remained  visible,  taking  refuge  under 
*  Indra's  protection,  in  his  terror,  cried  out  *  Indra,  Indra  *  with- 
out ceasing,  and  Indra,  recognizing  the  voice  of  Rahu  ere  he  was 
able  to  discern  him,  answered  his  appeal,  saying  '  Have  no  fear, 
I  am  about  to  slay  him  ! ' 

"  Meantime,  beholding  Airavata,  Maruti  reflected  *  O,  the 
lovely  fruit ! '  and  threw  himself  on  that  Lord  of  Elephants  and 
while  he  sought  to  take  hold  of  Airavata,  his  form  fearful  to 
behold  suddenly  appeared  over  Indra  and  his  followers.  There- 
after as  he  rushed  on  Sachi's  consort,  Indra,  not  unduly  angered, 
with  his  finger  loosed  a  thunderbolt  that  struck  Hanuman  and, 
at  the  impact,  the  child  fell  on  a  mountain,  in  his  fall  breaking 
his  left  jaw.  Seeing  his  son  lying  inanimate  under  the  stroke  of 
the  thunderbolt,  Pavana  was  enraged  against  Indra,  and  the  God 
Manila,  who  penetrates  and  infuses  all  beings,  withdrew  into  a 
cave  to  which  he  bore  his  child.  Thereafter,  as  Vasava  restrains 
the  floods,  he  caused  immense  sufferings  to  all  beings  by 
preventing  the  passage  of  excreta  and  urine  in  them. 

"  On  account  of  Vayu's  wrath  all  creatures  on  every  side  were 
deprived  of  their  breath  so  that  their  joints  were  dislocated  and 
they  became  as  blocks  of  wood.  All  sacred  studies,  the  holy 
syllable  '  Vashat ',  religious  ceremonies  and  duties  being 
suspended  by  Vayu's  displeasure,  the  Three  Worlds  became  a 
hell. 

"  Then  all  creatures  with  the  Gandharvas,  Devas,  Asuras  and 
men,  in  their  affliction  and  the  desire  to  become  happy  once  more, 
hurried  to  Prajapati ;  and  the  Gods,  their  bellies  swollen,  with 
joined  palms,  said  to  him  : — 

" '  Thou  hast  created  four  kinds  of  beings,  O  Blessed  One, 
Thou  art  their  protector.  Tbou  hast  given  us  Pavana  as  the 
Lord  of  our  lives,  why  nevertheless,  has  he  who  had  become  the 
Ruler  of  the  Vital  Breaths,  now  brought  about  this  misfortune 
in  the  manner  of  a  woman  in  the  inner  apartments  ?  ' 

"  Hearing  these  words  of  all  the  beings,  Prajapati,  who  was 
their  protector,  said  to  them,  *  It  is  true  1  *  and  added  '  Learn 
493 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  reason  which  incited  Vayu  to  anger  and  has  caused  this 
impediment.  O  Beings,  this  I  have  probed  for  myself.  The 
Foremost  of  the  Gods,  this  day,  caused  his  son  to  fail  at  Rahu's 
instigation,  whereupon  that  God  of  the  Wind  became  enraged 
and  Vayu,  though  bodiless,  circulates  in  every  body.  A  body 
bereft  of  Vayu  is  like  a  piece  of  wood,  Vayu  is  the  vital  breath, 
Vayu  is  felicity  itself,  Vayu  is  the  universe ;  without  Vayu,  the 
whole  world  cannot  be  happy ;  now  that  the  universe  is  bereft  of 
Vayu  it  is  deprived  of  life ;  all  creatures  without  breath  are  as 
boards.  For  not  having  honoured  the  son  of  Aditi,  we  must 
seek  out  Maruta,  the  author  of  our  ills,  lest  we  perish  ! ' 

"  Thereupon,  accompanied  by  all  beings,  Prajapati  with  the 
Devas,  Gandharvas,  Serpents  and  Guyhakas  approached  Maruta 
in  the  place  to  which  he  had  borne  his  son,  whom  the  King  of  the 
Gods  had  struck  down. 

"  Meanwhile,  perceiving  the  offspring  of  Sadagati,1  radiant  as 
the  sun,  fire  or  gold,  in  that  dark  cave  where  he  had  been  with- 
drawn, the  Four-faced  God  was  moved  with  compassion  as  also 
the  Devas,  Gandharvas,  Rishis,  Yakshas  and  Rakshasas." 


CHAPTER   36 

The  Boons  bestowed  on  the  Child  Hanuman  and  how  he  was 

cursed  by  the  Ascetics 

"As  soon  as  he  beheld  the  Grandsire  of  the  World,  Vayu,  taking 
his  young  child,  for  whom  he  had  wept  as  one  dead,  rushed 
towards  Dhatar.    With  his  waving  locks,  his  diadem  and  the 

garlands  with  which  he  was  adorned,  Vayu,  having  bowed  three 
times,  fell  at  the  feet  of  Brahma. 

"  Then  he,  who  was  conversant  with  the  Veda,  his  arms 
decorated  with  dazzling  bracelets,  touched  the  child  as  if  in 
play »  thereupon,  that  God  sprung  from  the  lotus,  merely  by 
caressing  the  child,  revived  him  as  seed  that  is  watered. 

1  Sadagati — A  name  of  Vayu,  the  God  of  the  Wind,  meaning  'Ever-going  ', 
his  son  being  Hanuman.  The  Wind  God  is  also  known  as  Vayu,  Kesarin  and 
other  titles. 


UTTARA    KANDA 

"  Beholding  his  son  restored,  the  Wind-god,  blowing  aus- 
piciously, began  to  circulate  in  all  beings  as  erstwhile  and,  treed 
from  the  obstructions  caused  by  Maruta,  all  creatures  became 
happy,  like  lakes  covered  with  lotuses  over  which  an  icy  wind 
has  ceased  to  blow. 

"  Then  Brahma,  who  possesses  the  three  pairs  of  qualities,1 
who  is  Himself  the  essence  of  Trimurti,  having  his  abode  in 
the  Three  Worlds,"  He  who  is  revered  by  the  Gods,  said  to  the 
Celestials,  in  his  anxiety  to  propitiate  Maruta : — 

"  *  Know  the  truth,  I  will  impart  it  to  you  for  it  is  important ! 
Hear  all  of  you,  Mahendra,  Agni,  Varuna,  Maheshwara, 
Dhaneshwara  and  others — this  child  will  carry  out  all  you  have 
to  accomplish,  therefore  grant  him  every  boon  in  order  to  gratify 
his  sire.' 

"  Thereupon  the  God  of  a  Thousand  Eyes,  delighted,  his 
brow  radiant,  took  off  his  garland  of  lotuses  and  spoke 
thus: — 

"  *  Since  the  thunderbolt  escaped  from  my  grasp  and  shattered 
his  jaw,  this  child  shall  be  called  Hanuman.  I  shall  bestow  an 
excellent  boon  upon  him  ;  from  to-day,  he  will  be  invulnerable 
to  thunderbolts !  * 

"  Then  Martanda,  in  his  turn,  that  blessed  One  who  dispels 
the  darkness,  said  :— 

"  *  I  will  bestow  a  hundredth  part  of  mine  effulgence  upon 
him  and  when  he  is  able  to  learn  the  Shastras,  I  will  endow  him 
with  eloquence !  * 

"  Thereafter  Varuna  accorded  him  the  following  boon, 
saying : — 

"  '  Innumerable  years  shall  pass,  yet  shall  my  noose  and  my 
waters  never  be  used  against  him  !  * 

"After  this,  Yama  granted  him  the  boon  of  invulnerability  and 
immunity  to  disease  and  said : — 

"  'As  a  sign  of  my  satisfaction,  I  shall  grant  him  the  further 
boon  of  never  being  slain  in  battle  ! ' 

*'  Then  the  red-eyed  Dhanada  spoke  thus  : — 

"  '  This  mace  held  by  me  shall  protect  him  in  combat  I '

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Thereafter  the  God  Shankara,  bestowing  the  foremost  of 
favours  upon  him,  said  : — 

"  *  I  shall  restrain  my  shafts  from  wounding  him ! ' 

"  Then  Vishvakarma  of  the  great  Car,  casting  his  eyes  on  the 
child,  said : — 

"  '  He  will  be  invulnerable  to  the  celestial  weapons  forged  by 
me  and  his  life  shall  endure  !  * 

"  Finally  the  magnanimous  Brahma  spoke  thus : — 

"  *  None  of  my  weapons  shall  be  able  to  harm  him  ! ' 

"  Beholding  the  child  enriched  by  the  boons  of  the  Gods,  the 
Four-faced  Lord,  Guru  of  the  Worlds,  in  his  satisfaction 
addressed  Vayu,  saying : — 

"  '  Thy  son,  Maruii,  will  be  the  terror  of  his  foes,  the  support 
of  his  friends  and  invincible !  Able  to  change  bis  form  at  will, 
he  will  accomplish  all  he  desires  and  go  wheresoever  he  pleases 
with  unimaginable  velocity.  In  order  to  destroy  Ravana  and 
gratify  Rama,  he  will  perform  such  feats  of  arms  that  will  cause 
every  being  to  tremble ! ' 

"  These  words  pacified  Vayu,  as  also  the  Immortals  and,  with 
the  Grandsire  at  their  head,  they  all  departed  to  the  place  from 
whence  they  had  come. 

"  Vayu,  the  Bearer  of  Perfume,  taking  his  son,  returned  home 
and,  telling  Anjana  of  the  boons  he  had  received,  went  away. 

"  O  Rama,  receiving  these  favours  which  filled  him  with 
power,  and  with  the  temerity  natural  to  him,  Hanuman  resembled 
the  ocean  that  is  overflowing. 

*'  In  his  intemperate  ardour,  that  bull  among  monkeys 
shamelessly  began  to  create  trouble  in  the  hermitages  of  the  great 
Rishis.  Scattering  the  spoons,  jars,  sacrificial  fires,  and  heaps  of 
bark  used  by  those  peace-loving  Sages,  overturning  and  shatter- 
ing them,  by  such  exploits,  he,  who  had  been  rendered  invulner- 
able to  all  brahmanic  weapons  by  Shambhu,  distinguished 
himself. 

"  Knowing  from  whence  his  power  was  derived,  the  great 
Rishis  bore  with  him,  nevertheless,  despite  the  warnings  of  his 
sire,  Kesharin,  the  son  of  Anjana  exceeded  all  bounds,  whereupon 
highly  indignant,  those  mighty  Rishis,  born  in  the  line  of 
Bhrigu  and  Angiras,  cursed  him,  O  Prince  of  the  Raghus, 
without,  however,  giving  rein  to  their  full  anger  and  irritation. 
496 


TJTTARA    KANDA 

"  They  said :—  *  Since,  in  the  knowledge  of  thy  power,  O 
Plavamgama,  thou  dost  harass  us,  by  the  adverse  effect  of  our 
curse  thou  shalt  become  unaware  of  it  for  a  long  time,  but, 
when  it  is  remembered  by  thee,  thou  shaft  be  able  to  wield  it 
effectively.  * 

"  Thereafter,  the  knowledge  of  his  powers  was  taken  from 
him  in  virtue  of  the  great  Rishis'  words  and,  from  that  moment, 
Hanuman  ranged  the  solitudes  in  a  placid  mood. 

"  At  that  time,  Riksharajas,  full  of  effulgence,  like  unto  the 
sun,  the  father  of  Bali  and  Sugriva,  ruled  over  all  the  monkeys 
and  after  a  prolonged  reign,  that  Sovereign  of  the  Monkeys 
succumbed  to  the  natural  law  of  time  and,  having  died,  the 
ministers,  learned  in  the  sacred  formulas,  installed  Bali  in  his 
father's  stead  and  Sugriva  as  heir-apparent. 

"  Hanuman  and  Sugriva  were  as  one  and  there  was  no 
difference  between  them  ;  they  loved  each  other  as  do  Agni  and 
Anila  but  when  the  quarrel  between  Bali  and  Sugriva  arose, 
Hanuman,  on  account  of  the  brahmins'  curse,  was  unaware  of 
his  powers,  nor,  in  the  terror  in  which  Bah  had  thrown  him,  did 
Sugriva  call  them  to  mind,  O  Lord.  The  curse  of  the  brahmins 
having  robbed  him  of  that  knowledge,  the  foremost  of  Monkeys, 
supported  Sugriva  as  an  ally  in  the  fight,  who  resembled  a  lion 
that  a  great  elephant  subdues.  For  valour,  energy,  intelligence, 
strength,  amiability,  sweetness  of  disposition,  knowledge  of  what 
is  fitting  and  not  fitting,  steadfastness,  skill,  courage  and  audacity, 
who  can  surpass  Hanuman  in  the  world  ? 

"  That  Indra  among  monkeys,  in  order  to  acquire  grammar 
took  refuge  with  the  Sun-god  and,  in  his  spirit  of  enquiry  that 
was  without  equal,  he  travelled  from  the  mountain  where  he 
rises  to  the  one  where  he  sets,  with  a  large  book,  a  vast  encyclo- 
pedia comprising  the  Sutras,  their  Commentaries,  their  meaning 
and  the  synthesis. 

"  That  Prince  of  Monkeys  became  an  accomplished  scholar 
and  none  equalled  him  in  the  Shastras  nor  in  the  interpretation 
of  the  Prosody.  In  all  the  sciences  and  in  the  rules  of  asceticism, 
he  rivalled  Brihaspati  By  thy  grace,  he  will  become  a  very 
brahmin  conversant  with  the  meaning  of  the  most  recent 
grammatical  systems.  Like  unto  an  ocean,  eager  to  engulf  the 
worlds,  like  unto  Pavaka  desirous  of  consuming  them  at  the

final  dissolution}  who  is  able  to  challenge  Hanuman,  that  second 
Antaka? 

"  O  Rama,  on  thine  account,  the  Gods  created  Hanuman  and 
the  other  foremost  of  monkeys,  Sugriva,  Mainda,  Dvivida  as 
also  Nila,  Tata,  Tareya,  Nala,  Rambha,  Gaja,  Gavaksha, 
Gavaya,  Sudamshtra,  Prabhojya,  Atimukha  and  Nala  as  also 
the  bears  with  those  leading  monkeys  who  were  all  created  by  the 
Gods,  O  Rama. 

"  I  have  answered  thy  question  fully  and  have  just  told  thee  of 
Hanuman's  exploit  accomplished  in  childhood." 

Agastya's  tale  greatly  amazed  Rama,  Saumitri,  the  monkeys 
and  the  Rakshasas,  and  Agastya  addressed  Rama,  saying  : — 

"  Thou  hast  learnt  all  that  I  have  to  tell ;  now  that  we  have 
beheld  thee  and  received  thine  hospitality,  we  crave  leave  to 
depart! " 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  supremely  pious  Agastya,  Raghava 
with  joined  palms,  bowing  to  that  great  Rishi,  said  : — 

"  To-day  the  Gods,  my  parents,  ancestors  and  my  family 
have  been  blessed  by  thy  holy  sight,  yea,  sanctified  for  ever.  In 
the  joy  of  my  return,  this  is  what  I  have  to  ask  of  thee.  It  is  for 
thee  in  thine  affection  to  concede  it. 

"  I,  who  came  to  establish  the  inhabitants  of  the  city  and  the 
country  in  their  personal  duties,  desire  thy  co-operation  in  the 
sacrifice  that  I  now  wish  to  perform,  O  Thou  who  belongest  to 
the  virtuous.  Wilt  thou,  whose  asceticism  eliminates  all  faults, 
not  assist  me  in  these  ceremonies,  for  then  shall  I  be  welcomed 
by  mine  ancestors  and  my  felicity  be  complete  ?  Do  ye  all 
assemble  here ! " 

On  this  request,  Agastya  and  the  other  Rishis  of  rigid  penances, 
answered,  "  Let  it  be  so  !  "  and  went  to  their  hermitages. 

Having  spoken  thus,  all  those  ascetics  departed  in  the  order 
in  which  they  had  come. 

Raghava,  having  reflected  on  the  utterances  of  the  Sage,  was 
greatly  astonished,  and  the  orb  of  the  day  having  withdrawn 
behind  the  Asta  Mountain,  he  dismissed  the  monkeys  and  the 
kings;  thereafter  that  foremost  of  men,  having  performed  hut 
evening  devotions  and  the  night  having  come,  retired  to  the 
inner  apartments.

CHAPTER     37 

Homage  is  paid  to  Skri  Rama 

The  installation  of  Kakutstha,  who  was  versed  in  the  science  of 
the  Self,  having  taken  place,  the  following  night  was  spent  by 
his  subjects  in  rejoicing  and  when  it  had  passed,  at  dawn,  those 
who  were  charged  with  waking  the  king  assembled  at  the  palace. 
Thereafter  these  sweet-voiced  minstrels,  like  unto  the  learned 
Kinneras,  chanted  pleasantly  to  that  valiant  prince  as  to  a 
cherished  son : — 

"  O  Gentle  Hero,  awake !  O  Thou  who  increaseth  the 
felicity  of  Kausbalya,  when  thou  dost  sleep  the  whole  universe 
is  wrapped  in  slumber,  O  Monarch  !  Thine  heroism  is  equal  to 
Vishnu's  and  thy  beauty  to  the  Ashvins.  Thou,  the  rival  of 
Brihaspati  in  wisdom,  an  a  second  Frajapati.  Thy  life's  span  is 
like  the  earth's,  thy  radiance  like  the  sun's,  thou  art  endowed 
with  the  swiftness  of  the  wind  and  thy  profundity  is  like  the  deep. 
Thou  art  unshakable  like  unto  Sthanu1  and  thy  charm  rivals  the 
moon.  No  king  was  ever  like  unto  thee  in  the  past  nor  shall 
there  ever  be  such  a  monarch  in  time  to  come,  O  Sovereign,  O 
Lion  among  Men,  since  thou  art  invincible,  firm  in  thy  duty  and 
ever  seeketh  the  welfare  of  thy  subjects,  glory  and  prosperity 
will  never  desert  thee.  Humility  and  piety  ever  reside  in  thee, 
O  Kakutstha ! " 

These  and  similar  praises  were  addressed  to  him  by  the  bards 
as  also  the  Sutas,2  who,  with  divine  hymns,  sought  to  rouse 
Raghava,  and  it  was  amidst  these  melodious  chants  that  he  woke 
from  sleep  and  rose  from  his  couch,  that  was  covered  with  white 
stuffs,  like  unto  Vishnu  when  he  leaves  the  snake  that  has  served 
as  tus  bed. 

Then  that  magnanimous  hero  stood  up  and  countless  atten- 
dants approached  him,  bowing  with  joined  palms,  offering  him 
beautiful  ewers  for  washing  and,  having  bathed  and  purified 
himself,  he  went  at  the  appointed  hour  to  kindle  the  sacrificial

fire  and  thereafter  with  swift  steps,  he  entered  the  sacred 
pavilion  reserved  for  the  Ikshvakus.  There  for  a  long  time  Rama 
paid  homage  to  the  Gods,  his  ancestors  and  the  brahmins, 
according  to  tradition,  then,  coming  forth  surrounded  by  his 
people,  he  went  to  the  outer  court  of  the  palace  accompanied  by 
his  counsellors  and  also  the  family  priests,  who  shone  in  their 
own  effulgence,  led  by  Vasishtha.  Wealthy  Kshatriyas,  Lords 
of  countless  provinces  walked  at  Rama's  side,  as  the  Celestials  by 
Shakra.  Bharata,  Lakshmana  and  Shatrughna,  of  great  renown, 
joyfully  formed  an  escort  of  honour  round  him,  like  unto  the 
Three  Vedas  at  the  Adhvara  Sacrifice.1  At  his  side  walked 
innumerable  attendants  with  joined  palms  and  radiant  counten- 
ance, named  Muditas.  Twenty  monkeys  full  of  energy  and 
prowess  led  by  Sugriva  followed  Rama,  and  Bibishana  between 
four  Rakshasas  walked  beside  that  hero,  as  Guhyakas  by  the 
Lord  of  Wealth.  Elders,  and  merchants  and  those  of  noble 
families,  bowing  to  the  king,  followed  him  with  dignity,  and  that 
Sovereign,  surrounded  by  the  blessed  and  illustrious  Rishis, 
mighty  kings,  monkeys  and  Rakshasas,  like  unto  the  Chief  of  the 
Gods,  received  continual  homage  from  the  ascetics ;  and  the 
countless  praises  of  those  who  entered  Rama's  presence,  and 
traditions,  full  of  eloquence  and  piety,  were  constantly  recited 
by  the  magnanimous  brahmins  versed  in  the  Scriptures.

On  having  heard  the  whole  story,  that  descendant  of  the  House 
of  Raghu  addressed  the  Sage  Agastya  and  said : — 

"  Revered  Lord,  Riksharajas  was  the  name  of  Sugriva  and 
Bali's  sire  but  what  was  the  name  of  their  mother  ?  From 
whence  did  she  come  and  why  were  Bali  and  Sugriva  so  called  ? 
Do  thou  tell  me  all  concerning  this  matter." 

Thereupon  the  Sage  Agastya  answered : — 

"  O  Rama,  I  shall  relate  everything  briefly  that  I  heard  from 
Sfari  Narada  when  he  visited  my  hermitage. 

1  Adhvara— A  religious  sacrifice,  especially  the  Soma  Sacrifice.

UTTARA    KANDA 

"  Once,  when  that  highly  virtuous  ascetic  was  journeying 
through  the  world,  he  came  to  my  retreat  and  I  paid  him  due 
homage  and  made  him  welcome.  When  he  was  seated  at  his 
ease,  being  curious,  I  put  this  same  question  to  him  and  he 
answered  me,  saying  : — 

"  '  Hear  me,  O  Great  Ascetic,  Foremost  of  the  Pious,  there  is 
a  mountain  named  Mem,  which  is  all  golden,  enchanting  and 
most  beautiful.  Its  central  peak  is  greatly  revered  by  the  Gods 
and  the  marvellous  assembly  hall  of  Brahma  is  situated  there, 
which  extends  over  a  hundred  leagues.  The  Four-mouthed 
Deity,  sprung  from  a  lotus,  ever  resides  there  and,  on  a  certain 
occasion  while  he  was  practising  Yoga,  a  few  tears  fell  from  his 
eyes,  whereupon  the  Patriarch,  with  his  hand,  brushed  them  away 
allowing  them  to  fall  on  the  earth  and  from  them  a  monkey  was 
born. 

"  '  O  Foremost  of  Men,  as  soon  as  that  monkey  appeared,  the 
high  souled  Brahma  instructed  him  in  sweet  accents,  saying  : — 

"  '  "  Do  thou  proceed  to  that  foremost  of  the  mountains 
where  the  Gods  perpetually  dwell,  O  Chief  of  Monkeys,  and 
subsist  there  on  the  various  fruits  and  roots.  On  that  enchanting 
mountain,  thou  sbouldst  live  depending  on  me,  O  Foremost  of 
Monkeys,  living  in  this  wise  for  some  time,  thou  sbalt  attain 
prosperity." ' 

"  O  Rama,  that  great  monkey,  offering  salutations  to  the  feet 
of  Brahma,  said  to  the  Creator  of  the  World  : — 

"  '  O  Lord,  I  shall  execute  thy  behest  and  live  depending  on 
Thee!' 

"  Thereafter  that  forest  dweller  immediately  proceeded  to  the 
wood  abounding  in  fruit  and  blossom,  and  there  he  lived  on 
fruits,  gathering  honey  and  various  blooms,  returning  to  Brahma 
each  evening  with  an  offering  of  the  most  excellent  fruit  and 
flowers,  which  he  placed  at  the  feet  of  that  God  of  Gods.  In 
this  way  he  spent  a  long  time  on  that  mountain. 

*'  O  Rama,  once  that  great  monkey,  Riksharajas,  was  afflicted 
by  thirst  and  went  to  the  northern  peak  of  Mount  Meru  where 
he  beheld  a  lake  ringing  with  the  songs  of  a  myriad  birds. 
Shaking  his  neck  in  delight,  he  observed  his  reflection  in  the 
waters  and,  beholding  that  image,  the  monkey  chief  rilled  with 
anger  and  anxiety  asked  himself,  '  What  arch  enemy  of  mine 

as  501 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

dwells  in  these  waters  ?  I  shall  destroy  the  excellent  abode  of 
that  vicious-souled  one  ! '  Thinking  thus  within  himself,  that 
monkey,  in  his  impetuosity,  plunged  into  the  lake  and  with  a 
bound  emerged  once  more,  but  as  he  rose  from  the  waters,  he 
found  himself  transformed  into  a  woman,  who  was  extremely 
charming,  graceful  and  fair. 

"  Her  waist  was  wide,  her  eyebrows  symmetrical,  her  hair 
black  and  curly,  her  countenance  fair  and  smiling,  her  bosom 
high  and  her  beauty  matchless.  On  the  banks  of  that  lake,  she 
appeared  enchanting,  iUwnining  the  four  quarters,  agitating  the 
minds  of  all  beings  and,  in  the  Three  Worlds,  she  was  as  beauti- 
ful as  any.  O  Rama,  she  resembled  the  simple  creeper,  Sastilata, 
or  Lakshmi  bereft  of  her  lotus  or  the  pure  rays  of  the  moon  or 
Parvati. 

"At  that  time,  India,  the  Lord  of  the  Celestials,  having 
worshipped  the  feet  of  Brahma,  was  returning  by  that  way  and 
the  Sun-god  also  came  thither. 

"  Simultaneously  beholding  that  lovely  female  form,  they  were 
overcome  with  desire,  and,  their  minds  being  in  a  ferment,  they 
were  wholly  swept  away. 

"  Thereupon  Indra  begot  a  son  on  that  woman,  named  Bali, 
so-called  because  his  seed  fell  on  the  hair  of  that  beauty,  and  the 
Solar  Deity  begot  another  son  on  her,  named  Sugriva,  who 
sprang  from  her  neck. 

"  Those  two  powerful  monkeys  being  born,  Indra  conferred 
a  lasting  golden  chain  on  Bali  and  returned  to  his  own  abode  and, 
having  engaged  Hanuman,  the  Wind-god's  son,  in  the  service  of 
Sugriva,  the  Sun-god  too  returned  to  the  Celestial  Region. 

"  O  King,  when  the  sun  rose  after  that  night  had  passed, 
Riksharajas  resumed  his  own  monkey  shape  and  he  gave  his  two 
highly  powerful  sons,  those  foremost  of  monkeys  possessed  of 
yellow  eyes,  able  to  change  their  shape  at  will,  some  honey  like 
unto  nectar  to  drink.  Thereafter,  taking  them  with  him,  he 
went  to  the  abode  of  Brahma  and  that  God,  beholding  Rik- 
sharajas with  his  two  sons,  consoled  him  in  diverse  ways  and 
issued  a  command  to  his  messenger,  saying ; — 

"  'At  my  behest,  O  Messenger,  proceed  to  the  beautiful  City 
of  Kishkindha,  that  large,  golden  and  enchanting  capital  is 
wormy  of  Riksharajas.  There  thousands  of  Vanaras  dwell, 
502 


UTTARA    RANDA 

besides  those  who  are  endowed  with  magic  powers.  Inaccessible 
and  abounding  in  gems,  those  of  the  four  castes  inhabit  it,  and 
it  is  pure  and  sacred. 

"  'At  my  command,  Vishvakarma  created  that  celestial  and 
enchanting  City  of  Kishkindha,  do  thou  find  an  abode  for 
Riksharajas,  the  foremost  of  the  Monkeys  and  his  sons  there,  and, 
having  called  the  leading  Plavamgamas  together  and  received 
them  courteously,  install  him  on  the  throne.  On  beholding  this 
monkey  chief,  gifted  with  intelligence,  they  will  all  become 
subject  to  him.' 

"  Brahma  having  spoken  thus,  the  celestial  messenger  with 
Riksharajas  proceeded  to  that  most  beautiful  City  of  Kishkindha 
with  the  speed  of  the  wind  where,  as  commanded  by  Brahma, 
he  installed  Riksharajas  as  king. 

"  Thereafter,  having  bathed  and  being  adorned  with  a  crown 
and  various  ornaments,  Riksharajas,  with  a  joyful  heart  began 
to  rule  over  the  monkeys,  and  all  the  Vanaras  residing  on  the 
earth,  comprising  the  Seven  Islands  and  bounded  by  the  sea, 
became  subject  to  him. 

"  Thus  Riksharajas  was  both  father  and  mother  to  Bali  and 
Sugriva ;  may  prosperity  attend  thee  !  The  learned,  who  listen 
to  and  cause  others  to  hear  this  narrative,  enhancing  their 
delight,  obtain  all  their  desires. 

"  O  Lord,  I  have  duly  described  at  length  all  that  concerns 
the  birth  of  the  monkey  kings  and  the  Rakshasas."

Shri  Rama  with  his  brothers,  hearing  that  ancient  and  wonderful 
tale,  was  astonished  and,  having  listened  to  the  Rishi  Agastya's 
narrative,  said : — 

"  By  thy  favour,  O  Rishi,  I  have  heard  this  highly  sacred 
theme  I  O  Great  Muni,  I  am  filled  with  amazement  on  hearing 
the  story  of  Bali  and  Sugriva.  O  Blessed  One,  I  am  not  surprised 
that  those  two  sons  of  the  Gods  should  be  so  powerful  since  their 
origin  was  divine  !  " 

503 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Rama,  having  uttered  these  words,  Agastya  said : — 

"  O  Long-armed  One,  even  thus  was  the  birth  of  Bali  and 
Sugriva  brought  about  in  days  of  yore.  I  shall  now  relate 
another  ancient  legend  to  thee,  O  Rama,  as  to  why  Ravana  bore 
Sita  away,  hear  me  with  attention  ! 

"  In  the  Golden  Age,  Ravana  offered  reverence  to  the  Grand- 
sire's  offspring,  that  truthful  Rishi  Sanatkumara,  who,  shining 
in  his  own  effulgence,  was  as  resplendent  as  the  sun  and  who  was 
seated  in  his  own  retreat,  and  paying  homage  to  him,  Ravana 
said: — 

"  *  O  Lord,  who  is  there  now  among  the  Gods,  who  is  brave 
and  powerful  and  by  whose  aid  the  Celestials  can  overcome  their 
foes,  one  whom  the  Twice-born  worship  daily  and  upon  whom 
devotees  constantly  meditate  ?  O  Thou,  whose  wealth  is  thy 
piety  and  who  art  possessed  of  the  sixfold  riches,  do  thou 
graciously  tell  me  in  detail.' 

"  Being  conversant  with  Ravana's  intentions,  the  glorious  Sage 
Sanatkumara,  having  knowledge  of  all  things  through  his 
meditations,  said  to  him  affectionately  : — '  Hear  me,  O  My  Son, 
the  wise,  in  their  sacrifices,  duly  pay  homage  to  the  Lord  of  the 
Universe,  whose  origin  is  unknown  to  us,  who  is  daily  worshipped 
by  the  Celestials  and  Asuras,  He  is  the  supremely  powerful 
Narayana  from  whose  navel,  Brahma,  the  Creator  of  the  World 
has  sprung  and  from  whom,  all  things  animate  and  inanimate  are 
born.  Yogis  meditate  upon  Him  and  offer  sacrifices  in  His 
honour  according  to  the  Puranas,  Vedas,  Pancharatras  and  other 
rituals.  In  combat,  He  is  ever  victorious  over  the  Daityas, 
Danavas,  Rakshasas  and  other  enemies  of  the  Gods,  all  of  whom 
ever  worship  Him.' 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  the  great  Ascetic  Sanatkumara, 
Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  making  obeisance  to  him, 
answered : — 

" '  Being  slain  by  Hari,  to  what  state  do  the  Daityas,  Danavas 
and  Rakshasas  attain  and  why  does  Hari  destroy  them  ?  ' 

"  Thereupon  Sanatkumara  replied : — '  They  who  are  slain  by 
the  Gods  abide  in  Swarga  but  are  born  again  on  earth  when  their 
merit  is  exhausted.  They  are  born  and  they  die,  they  suffer  and 
enjoy  according  to  the  merits  of  their  previous  births,  but  those 
who  are  slain  by  the  Wielder  of  the  Discus,  the  Lord  of  the 
504 


UTTARA    KANDA 

Three  Worlds,  Hari,  attain  to  His  region,  since  even  His  wrath 
is  like  unto  a  boon,  O  King ! ' 

"  Hearing  the  words  spoken  by  that  mighty  Ascetic  Sanat- 
kumara,  that  night-ranger,  Ravana,  filled  with  delight  and 
wonder,  began  to  reflect  on  how  he  might  enter  into  conflict 
with  die  Lord." 


THIRD    OF    THE    INTERPOLATED    CHAPTERS

"As  the  vicious-souled  Ravana  was  reflecting  thus,  the  great 
Ascetic  Sanatkumara  said  to  him  : — 

"  *  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  what  thy  mind  has  conceived  will 
be  accomplished  in  a  great  encounter !  Rejoice  and  wait 
awhile !  * 

"  Hearing  these  words,  the  long-armed  Ravana  addressed  the 
Sage  and  said  : — 

" '  O  Foremost  of  the  Rishis,  do  thou  tell  me  in  detail  what 
are  His  distinguishing  characteristics  ?  * 

"  Having  listened  to  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  the  ascetic 
replied  : — 

"  (  Listen  and  I  will  tell  thee  all :— O  Foremost  of  the  Rak- 
shasas, in  the  universe  of  animate  and  inanimate  beings,  that 
great  God  is  all-pervading,  subtle,  eternal  and  omnipresent.  He 
is  present  in  the  Celestial  Region,  on  earth  and  in  the  region 
under  the  earth,  on  the  mountains,  in  the  forests  and  all  stationary 
objects,  rivers  and  cities ;  He  is  "  Aum  ",  He  is  Truth,  He  is 
Savitri  and  the  earth ;  He  is  the  supporter  of  the  earth  and  the 
Serpent  Ananta ;  He  is  day  and  night,  morning  and  evening, 
death,  the  moon,  time,  the  wind,  Brahma,  Rudra,  Indra  and 
Varuna.  He  causes  the  worlds  to  appear  and  shine  forth ;  He 
creates  them,  destroys  them,  rules  over  them  and  sports  therein. 
He  is  eternal,  the  Lord  of  Men,  He  is  Vishnu,  the  Ancient 
Purusha  and  the  only  Destroyer.  What  more  is  there  to  say,  O 
Dashanana  ?  He  pervades  the  Three  Worlds,  the  moving  and 
unmoving.  Wearing  yellow  raiment  like  unto  the  filaments  of  a 
lotus,  Narayana  resembles  the  lightning  flashes.    Bearing  the

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Shrivatsa  Mark  on  His  breast,  that  cloud-coloured  Lord,  like 
unto  the  moon,  is  pleasing  to  look  upon.  Lakshmi  resides  in 
His  body  in  the  form  of  warfare,  as  lightning  in  the  clouds. 
Neither  Devas,  Asuras  nor  Nagas  are  able  to  look  on  Him  but 
the  one,  with  whom  He  is  pleased,  alone  beholds  Him.  O  My 
Son,  neither  by  die  fruits  of  sacrifice,  penance,  self-control, 
gifts  nor  rituals  nor  by  any  other  means  can  one  behold  that 
Supreme  God.  Those  alone  see  Him  who  have  surrendered 
their  whole  life  and  being  to  Him  and  who,  by  virtue  of  discrim- 
inative knowledge,  have  burnt  up  all  their  sins.  If  thou  desirest 
to  behold  Him,  hear  me  and  I  will  tell  thee  all. 

" '  At  the  close  of  the  Golden  Age  and  the  beginning  of  the 
Silver  Age,  the  Lord  Narayana  will  assume  human  form  for 
the  sake  of  men  and  the  Gods.  A  son,  named  Rama,  will  be  born 
to  Dasaratha  of  the  Ikshvaku  Race,  who  will  rule  on  earth. 
Rama  will  be  highly  effulgent,  powerful  and  as  forbearing  as  the 
earth  nor  shall  his  enemies  in  combat  be  able  to  look  on  him,  as 
one  is  unable  to  gaze  upon  the  sun. 

"  *  His  consort,  the  gracious  Lakshmi  shall  be  renowned  under 
the  name  of  Sita  and  be  born  as  the  daughter  of  Janaka,  King  of 
Mithila  ;  she  will  issue  from  the  earth.  In  beauty,  she  will  be 
unequalled  in  the  world,  endowed  with  auspicious  marks  she  will 
ever  follow  Rama  like  a  shadow,  as  the  moon  is  accompanied  by 
its  beams;  of  virtuous  conduct,  she  will  be  chaste  and  patient. 
Sita  and  Rama  will  always  appear  together  as  the  sun  and  its 
rays.  O  Ravana,  I  have  now  related  to  thee  all  that  concerns 
Narayana,  the  great,  eternal  and  incomprehensible  Brahman.' 

"  O  Raghava,  on  hearing  these  words,  the  mighty  Lord  of  the 
Rakshasas  began  to  devise  means  whereby  he  might  enter  into 
combat  with  thee.  Meditating  again  and  again  on  the  words  of 
Sanatkumara,  he  began  to  wander  here  and  there." 

Listening  to  this  narrative,  Rama,  his  eyes  wide  with  wonder, 
was  greatly  astonished  and,  being  delighted,  he  again  addressed 
Agastya,  the  foremost  of  the  wise,  saying : — 

"  Do  thou  recount  the  ancient  traditions  further,  O  Lord."

The  illustrious  Rishi  Agastya,  sprung  from  a  vessel,1  paying 
obeisance  to  Rama,  as  Brahma  pays  homage  to  Shiva,  addressed 
that  hero  whose  prowess  was  truth,  saying : — 

"  Do  thou  hear  me !  " 

Thereafter  the  highly  effulgent  Agastya  began  to  relate  the 
subsequent  events  in  that  legend,  and  the  blessed  Sage  with  a 
delighted  heart  described  to  Rama  all  he  had  heard  narrated, 
saying : — 

"  O  Illustrious  and  Long-armed  Rama,  it  is  on  this  account 
that  the  vicious-souled  Ravana  stole  Sita,  the  daughter  of  Janaka, 
away.  O  Thou  who  art  possessed  of  long  arms,  O  Great  Warrior, 
O  Thou  who  art  invincible,  Narada  recounted  this  tale  to  me  on 
the  summit  of  the  Mem  Mountain.  O  Raghava,  the  highly 
effulgent  One  told  me  this  story  in  the  presence  of  the  Devas, 
Gandharvas,  Siddhas,  Ascetics  and  other  great  Beings.  O  Lord 
of  Monarchs,  O  Conferer  of  Honours,  do  thou  hear  this  tale 
which  removes  great  sins  !  Listening  to  it,  O  Thou  of  long  arms, 
the  Rishis  and  the  Devas,  with  delighted  hearts,  their  eyes 
shining  with  the  splendour  of  lotus  flowers,  said  to  the  Ascetic 
Narada  :— 

" '  He,  who  listens  to  or  relates  this  story  with  faith  and 
devotion,  shall  be  blessed  with  sons  and  grandsons  and,  after 
his  death,  be  honoured  in  the  Celestial  Region.'  " 


FIFTH    OF    THE    INTERPOLATED    CHAPTERS 
2nd   SERIES 

"  O  Rama,  Ravana,  the  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  proud  of  his 
strength,  accompanied  by  his  warriors,  began  to  range  the  earth 
desirous  of  conquest.    Whenever  he  heard  of  any  among  the 

1  Agastya  was  said  to  have  been  bom  in  a  water  jar. 
507 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Daityas,  Danavas  or  Rakshasas  who  were  powerful,  he  challenged 
them  to  fight. 

"  O  Lord  of  the  Earth,  having  traversed  the  whole  world,  the 
Ten-necked  Rakshasa  beheld  the  Sage  Narada  returning  from 
Brahmaloka  to  his  own  abode,  like  unto  a  second  sun,  passing 
through  the  clouds.  Then  Ravana,  with  a  cheerful  heart, 
approached  him  and,  with  joined  palms,  addressed  the  Sage, 
saying: — 

"  *  O  Thou  gifted  with  the  six  kinds  of  wealth,  many  times 
thou  hast  beheld  all  creation  from  Brahma  down  to  an  insect. 
Do  thou  tell  me,  O  Great  One,  in  which  region  the  inhabitants 
are  the  most  powerful,  I  wish  to  challenge  them  to  combat 
according  to  my  whim.' 

"  Thereupon,  reflecting  an  instant,  the  divine  Sage  Narada 
answered  him  saying : — 

"  *  O  King,  there  is  a  large  island  in  the  Milky  Ocean,  where 
all  the  inhabitants  are  endowed  with  great  strength  and  are  of 
enormous  stature,  as  effulgent  as  the  moon's  beams,  possessing 
fair  complexions,  voices  as  deep  as  the  muttering  of  clouds  and 
who  are  extremely  valiant.  Their  arms  are  long  and  like  iron 
bars,  O  King  of  the  Asuras,  such  are  the  people  of  that  island, 
who  are  as  powerful  as  thou  wouldst  wish  to  see  on  earth.' 
"  Hearing  the  words  of  Narada,  Ravana  said  : — 
"  *  O  Divine  Sage,  why  are  the  people  of  that  island  so  strong 
and  how  did  such  mighty  beings  come  to  live  in  that  place  ?  O 
Lord,  do  thou  relate  everything  to  me  at  length.  The  whole 
world  is  ever  seen  by  tbee  like  a  fruit  in  the  palm  of  the 
hand  1 ' 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  Ravana,  the  blessed  Sage  said : — 
"  '  O  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  the  people  of  that  island  constantly 
worship  Narayana  with  their  whole  being.    Their  hearts  and 
minds  are  ever  set  on  Him  and,  having  given  their  lives  and  souls 
to  Narayana  alone,  they  have  been  blessed  with  that  abode  and 
dwell  on  Sweta-dwipa.  Those  who  die  in  battle  at  the  bands  of 
Shri  Narayana,  Bearer  of  the  discus  and  Preserver  of  the  World, 
go  to  the  celestial  region.  O  Friend,  neither  by  sacrifice,  penance, 
excellent  gifts  nor  by  any  oilier  pious  act  does  one  attain  to  that 
region  full  of  bliss.' 
"  Hearing  these  words  of  Narada,  Ravana  was  amazed  and 
508 


UTTARA    KANDA 

reflecting  awhile,  said : — *  I  will  enter  into  conflict  with  these 
people !  * 

"  Thereafter,  taking  leave  of  Narada,  he  proceeded  to  Sweta- 
dwipa  and  Narada,  pondering  for  a  long  time,  curious  to 
witness  that  encounter,  speedily  left  for  that  island,  he  being  fond 
of  mischief  and  conflict. 

"  O  Prince,  Ravana,  with  his  Rakshasas,  advanced  on  Sweta- 
dwipa,  rending  the  four  quarters  with  bis  leonine  roars,  and 
Narada  preceded  him  to  that  island  that  was  difficult  of  access 
even  to  the  Devas. 

"  There  the  Pushpaka  Car  of  the  mighty  Ravana  was  assailed 
by  adverse  winds  so  that  it  was  unable  to  stand  against  them  and 
was  tossed  about  like  a  straw,  nor  could  it  remain  stationary  on 
account  of  the  furious  blasts.  Then  Ravana's  counsellors  said 
to  him : — 

"  '  O  Lord,  we  are  beside  ourselves  and  overcome  by  fear ;  it 
is  not  possible  for  us  to  remain  here,  how  then  shall  we  be  able 
to  fight  ?  * 

"  Speaking  thus,  the  Rakshasas  fled  away  in  all  directions ; 
then  Ravana  sent  away  his  aerial  car  decorated  with  gold  with 
the  Rakshasas  and,  assuming  a  terrible  form,  entered  the  island 
alone. 

"  Thereafter,  as  he  was  approaching,  he  was  observed  by  many 
women  of  that  white  island,  who,  drawing  near,  took  hold  of  his 
hand  and  smiling,  said : — 

" '  Why  hast  thou  come  hither  ?  Who  art  thou  ?  Who  is  thy 
sire  ?  Who  has  sent  thee,  tell  us  all  candidly  ? ' 

"  Than  Ravana,  enraged,  answered  : — 

" '  I  am  the  son  of  the  Sage  Vishravas  and  my  name  is 
Ravana !  I  have  come  hither  in  order  to  fight  but  I  see  no 
warrior  here !  * 

"  When  the  wicked-minded  Rakshasa  had  spoken  thus,  the 
maidens  laughed  gently,  but  one  of  them,  incensed,  suddenly 
took  hold  of  Ravana  as  one  would  a  child  and,  as  if  in  play, 
tossed  him  to  and  fro  to  her  companions,  saying  : — 

" '  See,  I  have  caught  an  insect,  how  wonderful  it  is  with  its 
ten  hands,  twenty  arms  and  its  colour  resembling  a  heap  of 
antimony ! ' 

"  Thereafter,  they  passed  him  from  hand  to  hand  in  play,  each 
509 


THE   RAMAYASA    OF   VALMIKJ 

spinning  him  with  her  fingers  and  Ravana,  worn  out  by  being 
handled  thus,  grew  exceedingly  angry  and  bit  the  hand  of  one  of 
those  fair  ones,  who,  being  in  pain,  let  him  go,  whereupon 
another,  seizing  the  powerful  Rakshasa,  rose  into  the  sky.  Then 
Ravana,  in  fury,  tore  her  with  his  nails  and  being  dropped  by 
that  damsel,  the  night-ranger,  terrified,  fell  into  the  waters  of 
the  sea,  as  a  mountain  peak  when  shattered  by  a  thunderbolt. 

"  O  Rama,  those  youthful  women  of  Sweta-dwipa  again 
caught  hold  of  the  Rakshasa  and  began  to  fling  him  to  and  fro. 
At  that  moment,  the  illustrious  Sage  Narada,  observing  Ravana's 
plight,  was  astonished  and,  laughing  loudly,  began  to  dance  with 
delight. 

"  O  Great  King,  desirous  of  receiving  death  at  thy  hand,  the 
wicked  Ravana  bore  Sita  away.  Thou  art  Narayana,  the  Wielder 
of  the  Conch,  discus  and  mace.  Thou -dost  bear  the  lotus,  the 
thunderbolt  and  the  bow  in  thine  hands.  Thou  art  Hrishikesha 
and  art  adorned  with  the  Shrivatsa  Mark,  Thou  art  the  Maha- 
Yogi,  ever  worshipped  by  the  Devas  and  Thou  dost  confer 
fearlessness  on  Thy  devotees.  Thou  hast  assumed  a  human  form 
in  order  to  slay  Ravana.  Dost  Thou  know  thy  Self  to  be 
Narayana,  O  Blessed  One,  do  not  forget  thy  real  Self,  recollect 
that  Thou  art  the  true  Self ;  Brahma  Himself  has  declared  Thee 
to  be  the  Mystery  of  all  mysteries  ! 

"  O  Prince  of  the  Raghus,  Thou  art  the  Three  Gunas,  the 
Three  Vedas,  The  Three  Regions,  that  of  the  Celestials,  of  men 
and  the  region  under  the  earth,  Thou  dost  sport  in  the  three 
divisions  of  time,  Thou  art  conversant  with  the  science  of  archery, 
music  and  medicine,  Thou  art  the  Destroyer  of  the  enemies  of 
the  Gods.  In  days  of  yore,  Thou  didst  traverse  the  Three 
Worlds  in  three  strides.  Thou  art  born  of  Aditi  and  art  the 
younger  brother  of  Indra,  born  to  bind  Bali.  O  Fore- 
most of  the  Gods,  the  purpose  of  the  Devas  has  been  accom- 
plished I  The  wicked  Ravana  with  his  sons  and  kinsmen  has 
been  slain ;  the  Rishis,  who  have  piety  as  their  wealth,  and  all 
the  Gods  are  gratified.  O  Chief  of  the  Immortals,  all  this  has 
been  brought  about  by  Thy  grace  ! 

"  Sita  is  the  personification  of  Lakshmi  and  arose  from  the 
earth ;   for  thy  sake,  she  was  born  in  the  House  of  Janaka. 
Bringing  her  to  Lanka,  Ravana  protected  her  with  care  as  his 
510 


UTTARA    KANDA 

own  mother.  0  Rama,  I  have  related  the  whole  story  to  thee, 
the  immortal  Narada  described  it  to  me,  having  heard  it  from 
the  Rishi  Sanatkumara  ;  Dashanana  followed  the  instructions  of 
Saoatkumara  faithfully. 

"  Whoever  listens  to  this  narrative  in  faith  and  knowledge  at 
the  time  of  sacrifice,  his  offerings  of  food,  becoming  imperish- 
able, reach  the  ancestors." 

Hearing  this  divine  theme,  the  lotus-eyed  Rama,  with  his 
brothers,  was  gready  astonished  and  the  monkeys,  their  eyes 
wide  with  delight,  with  Sugriva,  the  Rakshasas,  Bibishana,  the 
kings,  their  counsellors  and  the  assembled  Brahmins,  Kshatriyas, 
Vaishyas  and  Shudras  gazed  on  Rama  with  joy. 

Then  the  highly  effulgent  Agastya  said  to  Rama  :— 

"  O  Rama,  we  have  all  looked  on  Thee  and  been  honoured  by 
thee  and  now  beg  leave  to  depart." 

Speaking  thus  and  having  received  due  homage,  they  returned 
whence  they  had  come. 

The  sun  having  set,  Rama,  the  foremost  of  men,  bade  farewell 
to  the  monkeys  and  their  Sovereign  and  duly  performed  the 
Sandbya  Rites ;  thereafter  night  having  gradually  set  in,  he 
entered  the  inner  apartments. 


CHAPTER    38 

Rama  takes  leave  of  his  Allies 

Having  been  duly  installed  as  king,  Raghava  spent  his  days 
directing  all  those  things  pertaining  to  the  inhabitants  of  the 
city  and  country.  After  some  time,  he,  with  joined  palms, 
addressed  the  King  of  Mithila  in  these  terms  :— 

"  O  Lord,  now  that  our  happiness  is  assured  by  thy  support, 
it  being  by  virtue  of  thy  great  prowess  that  I  have  been  able  to 
slay  Ravana,  all  those  of  the  Houses  of  Ikshvaku  and  Mithila, 
everywhere,  enjoy  a  felicity  without  parallel.  Do  thou  return  to 
thy  capital  after  accepting  these  jewels ;  Prince  Bharata  will 
attend  thee  as  thine  escort," 

**  Be  it  so  I "  replied  Janaka  and  prepared  to  depart,  thereafter 
adding:— 

5« 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  I  am  pleased  with  thee  and  thy  conduct ;  as  for  the  gems 
that  thou  hast  heaped  upon  me,  I  bequeath  them  all  to  my 
daughter,  O  Prince !  " 

Janaka  having  departed,  Raghava,  with  joined  palms,  respect- 
fully addressed  the  son  of  Kaikeyi,  his  maternal  uncle,  the  Prince 
Yudajita,  saying ; — 

"  This  empire,  I  myself,  Bharata  and  Lakshmana  also,  are  at 
thy  disposal,  O  Lion  among  Men.  The  King,  thine  aged  sire 
may  be  grieving  on  thy  behalf  and  thy  return  this  day  will 
delight  him,  O  Lord.  Lakshmana  will  follow  thee  as  thine 
escort  after  thou  hast  accepted  wealth  and  gems  of  every  kind." 

Acquiescing  to  his  request,  Yudajita  answered  "  It  is  well !  As 
for  the  pearls  and  gold,  do  thou  retain  them  forever  !  "  There- 
after, the  son  of  Kaikeya  paid  obeisance  to  Rama,  keeping  him 
on  his  right  hand  and  after  receiving  homage,  he  departed, 
followed  by  Lakshmana  as  Vishnu  by  Indra  at  the  time  of  the 
destruction  of  Vritra. 

Having  bade  farewell  to  his  maternal  uncle,  Rama  embraced 
his  friend,  Pratardana,  the  King  of  Kashi,  and  addressed  him  in 
these  words : — 

"  Thou  hast  proved  thy  friendship  and  devotion  to  the  full,  O 
Prince,  as  witnessed  by  the  campaign  undertaken  with  Bharata.1 
Now  return  this  day  to  the  enchanting  City  of  Benares  of  which 
thou  art  die  support  and  which  is  surrounded  by  great  walls  and 
magnificent  gateways." 

Speaking  thus,  the  virtuous  Kakutstha,  rising  from  his  throne, 
held  him  in  a  close  embrace  for  a  long  time,  thereafter  permitting 
him  to  take  his  leave.  Bidding  farewell  to  the  King  of  Kashi, 
Raghava,  the  increaser  of  Kaushalya's  joy,  speedily  returned 
to  his  own  city  in  safety. 

Having  dismissed  Kasheya,  Raghava  smilingly  addressed 
courteous  words  to  the  hundred  monarchs  present  and  said  to 
them: — 

"  Your  loyalty  has  been  unshakable  and  your  affection 
enduring ;  through  the  grace  of  your  devotion  and  the  prowess 
of  magnanimous  warriors  such  as  you  are,  that  insensate  and 
perverse  wretch,  Ravana,  has  been  slain  !   It  is  your  prowess  that 

1  A  commentator  explains  that  at  the  time  Rama  was  fighting  with  Ravana, 
the  King  of  Kashi  and  Bharata  went  to  his  aid. 


UTTARA    KANDA 

has  destroyed  him,  I  was  merely  the  occasion  of  his  destruction 
in  the  fight  with  his  forces,  his  sons,  his  ministers  and  his  kins- 
folk. Hearing  that  the  daughter  of  King  Janaka  had  been  borne 
away  in  the  forest,  the  great-hearted  Bharata  summoned  you  all. 
Your  devotion  has  been  unanimous,  O  Princes  of  great  soul,  but 
your  stay  here  has  been  prolonged  and  I  now  wish  to  assure 
myself  of  your  safe  return." 
Then  the  kings,  greatly  delighted,  answered  him  saying : — 
"  By  the  grace  of  heaven  thou  hast  triumphed,  O  Rama,  and 
hast  regained  thy  kingdom  >  By  divine  grace,  thou  hast  re- 
covered Sita !  By  divine  grace,  thy  foe  is  vanquished  !  To 
behold  thee  victorious  and  delivered  from  thine  enemies,  O 
Rama,  was  our  most  ardent  desire  and  is  now  our  supreme 
satisfaction  !  The  praises  thou  hast  heaped  upon  us  are  natural 
to  thee,  O  Thou  whose  merits  are  such  that  we  cannot  match 
them  with  our  tributes.  We  are  about  to  take  leave  of  thee  but 
thou  wilt  ever  remain  in  our  thoughts  !  O  Long-armed  Warrior, 
we  shall  return  full  of  devotion  to  thee.  Mayest  thou,  O  Great 
Prince,  ever  hold  us  in  affection." 

"  Be  it  so  !  "  replied  Rama  and  the  kings,  highly  delighted  paid 
obeisance  to  Raghava  with  joined  palms,  eager  to  return  home 
and,  having  been  duly  honoured  by  him,  went  to  their  own 
countries. 

chapter   39 

Rama  loads  his  Allies  with  Gifts 

Those  magnanimous  princes  departed  joyfully  on  their  countless 
elephants  and  horses  whose  tread  shook  the  earth.  Many  army 
divisions,  full  of  ardour,  had  come  to  the  aid  of  Raghava  under 
Bharata's  command  with  their  regiments  and  squadrons. 
Thereafter,  in  the  pride  of  their  strength,  those  monarchs 
said: — 

"  We  did  not  see  Rama's  adversary,  Ravana,  on  the  battlefield  ; 
Bharata  called  on  us  too  late  or  those  Rakshasas  would  assuredly 
soon  have  fallen  under  our  blows.  With  the  protection  of  the 
valiant  Rama  and  Lakshmana  we  should  have  striven  successfully 
without  anxiety  on  the  shores  of  the  ocean." 
5*3 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Conversing  on  this  and  other  matters,  those  kings,  roll  of  joy 
returned  to  their  kingdoms,  those  mighty  empires  that  were 
prosperous,  happy,  abounding  in  silver  and  grain  and  over- 
flowing with  treasure.  Reaching  their  capitals  safely,  those 
monarchs,  anxious  to  gratify  Rama,  paid  him  homage  by  sending 
him  every  kind  of  precious  object :  horses,  carriages,  jewels, 
elephants  intoxicated  with  ichor,  rare  sandalwood,  celestial 
ornaments,  gems,  pearls,  coral,  lovely  slave  girls,  coverings  made 
of  goats  skin  and  a  variety  of  chariots. 

The  mighty  Bharata,  Lakshmana  and  Shatrughna,  having 
accepted  those  gifts,  took  their  way  back  to  the  capital  and, 
returning  to  the  ravishing  City  of  Ayodhya,  those  lions  among 
men  handed  all  those  objects  of  great  price  to  Rama,  who, 
receiving  them,  joyfully  bestowed  them  on  Sugriva,  who  had 
fulfilled  his  duty,  and  also  on  Bibishana  and  the  other  Rakshasas 
and  the  monkeys,  by  whose  aid  he  had  attained  victory,  and 
those  monkeys  and  titans  decorated  their  heads  and  arms  with 
the  jewels  that  Rama  had  given  them. 

Thereafter,  the  Sovereign  of  the  Ikshvakus,  that  warrior  of 
the  great  car,  he  whose  eyes  resembled  the  petals  of  the  lotus, 
Rama,  seating  Hanuman  and  Angada  on  bis  knees,  said  to 
Sugriva : — 

"  This  Angada,  thine  illustrious  son,  and  the  Son  of  the 
Wind,  thy  minister,  O  Sugriva,  both  of  whom  are  endowed  with 
wisdom  and  devoted  to  our  interests,  merit  every  kind  of  honour 
and,  on  thine  account  also,  O  King  of  the  Monkeys." 

With  these  words,  the  illustrious  Rama  took  off  some  extremely 
rare  ornaments  from  his  breast  and  decorated  Angada  and 
Hanuman  with  them. 

Thereafter  Raghava  addressed  the  foremost  of  the  monkey 
leaders— Nila,  Nala,  Kesharin,  Kumuda,  Gandhamadana, 
Sushena,  Panasa,  the  valiant  Mainda  and  Dvivida,  Jambavan, 
Gavaksha,  Vinata  and  Dhumra,  Balimukha,  and  Frajangha, 
Samnada  of  great  valour,  Darimukha,  Dadhimukha  and  Indra- 
janu,  and  in  a  sweet  voice,  consuming  them  with  his  glance 
as  it  were,  in  gentle  accents  said  : — 

"  You  are  my  friends,  my  brothers,  my  very  Sdf !    It  is  you 
who  have  saved  me  from  misfortune,  O  Dwellers  in  the  Woods  1 
Happy  is  King  Sugriva  to  possess  such  excellent  friends  1 " 
5M 


UTTARA    KANDA 

Uttering  these  words,  that  lion  among  men  bestowed  jewels 
upon  them  in  accord  with  their  desserts  as  also  diamonds  of  great 
price  and  then  embraced  them  all.  Thereafter  they  drank  of 
fragrant  honey  and  partook  of  choice  viands,  roots  and  fruits 
and,  sojourning  there  for  a  month,  such  was  their  devotion  to 
Rama,  that  it  seemed  to  them  that  but  an  hour  had  passed. 
Rama  too  spent  the  time  happily  in  the  company  of  the  monkeys, 
who  were  able  to  change  their  form  at  will,  and  the  extremely 
powerful  titans  and  bears  of  great  energy. 

In  this  way  the  second  month  of  autumn  passed  and  the 
monkeys  and  titans  savoured  delights  of  every  kind  in  that  city 
belonging  to  the  Ikshvakus  that  was  full  of  allurements  and, 
during  the  time  they  were  thus  entertained,  by  the  grace  of 
Rama's  affectionate  regard,  the  hours  flew  by  happily  for  them. 


chapter   40 

Rama  takes  leave  of  the  Bears,  Monkeys  and  Titans 

In  tins  way,  the  bears,  monkeys  and  titans  passed  their  time  with 
Rama,  and  thereafter  the  mighty  Raghava  said  to  Sugriva : — 

"  Return  to  Kishkindha,  My  Friend,  which  may  not  be 
conquered  by  the  Gods  or  Asuras  themselves.  With  thy 
ministers,  rule  over  thine  empire  without  hindrance.  O  Mighty 
King,  thou  shouldst  look  on  Angada  with  supreme  affection  as 
also  Hanuman  and  the  great-hearted  Nala,  Sushena  thy  valiant 
father-in-law,  and  Tara  the  foremost  of  warriors,  the  invincible 
Kamuda  and  Nila  who  is  full  of  strength,  the  energetic  Shatabali, 
Mainda,  Dvivida,  Gaja,  Gavaksha,  Gavaya,  the  mighty  Sharabha 
and  the  King  of  the  Bears  the  indomitable  Jamba  van.  Look  also 
with  affection  on  Gandhamadana,  the  agile  Rishabha,  the 
Plavamgamas  Suptala,  Kesharin,  Shumbha  and  Shankashuda,  all 
these  magnanimous  ones,  who  in  order  to  serve  my  cause  were 
ready  to  give  up  their  lives ;  look  on  them  always  with  friendli- 
ness and  never  cause  them  pain." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Sugriva,  whom  he  embraced  again  and 
again,  Rama  said  affectionately  to  Bibishana  : — 

"  Do  thou  rule  Lanka  faithfully ;  thou  art  conversant  with 
5*5 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

thy  duty,  this  is  my  conviction  and  also  of  those  in  the  capital, 
the  Rakshasas  and  thy  brother  Vaishravana.  Give  no  place  in 
thy  soul  to  evil,  O  King  !  Just  monarchs  are  assured  of  earthly 
prosperity.  Think  ever  of  me  and  Sugriva,  mine  ally,  O  Prince, 
and  in  perfect  contentment  go  hence  without  anxiety  !  " 

Hearing  Rama's  words,  the  bears,  monkeys  and  Rakshasas 
cried,  "Excellent!  Excellent!"  praising  Kakutstha  again  and 
again,  saying : — 

"  Thy  wisdom,  O  Long-armed  Hero,  thy  wonderful  valour, 
thine  extreme  goodness,  O  Rama,  has  ever  rendered  thee  the 
equal  of  Swyambhu  !  " 

While  the  monkeys  and  the  titans  were  speaking  thus, 
Hanuman,  bowing  to  Raghava,  said  : — 

"  I  shall  ever  hold  thee  in  the  greatest  affection,  O  Prince,  my 
devotion  is  thine  forever,  O  Hero,  nor  shall  I  give  mine  allegiance 
to  any  other  object.  As  long  as  thy  story  is  told  in  the  world, 
assuredly  life  will  remain  in  my  body,  O  Valiant  Rama.  The 
Apsaras  will  recount  thine  history  and  all  thy  divine  exploits  to 
me,  O  Joy  of  the  Raghus,  O  Lion  among  Men,  and,  listening  to 
them,  O  Great  Hero,  the  nectar  of  thy  deeds  will  dispel  all  mine 
anxieties,  as  the  wind  chases  away  a  flock  of  clouds.  " 

As  Hanuman  was  speaking,  Rama  rose  from  his  marvellous 
throne  and,  embracing  him  tenderly,  said  to  him  : — 

"  Undoubtedly  so  will  it  be,  O  Best  of  Monkeys,  as  long  as 
my  story  is  current  in  the  world,  so  long  will  thy  fame  endure 
and  life  remain  in  thy  body.  For  every  service  thou  hast 
rendered  me,  I  would  give  up  my  life  and  still  remain  thy  debtor, 
O  Monkey.  In  mine  heart,  the  memory  of  what  thou  hast 
done  for  me  will  ever  abide,  O  Hanuman ;  it  is  in  times  of 
misfortune  that  one  has  recourse  to  those  whom  one  has 
benefited." 

Thereafter,  taking  from  his  neck  a  string  of  pearls  from  which 
an  emerald  as  bright  as  the  moon  hung,  Raghava  placed  it  round 
Hanuman's  and,  with  that  rope  of  pearls  falling  on  his  breast, 
the  monkey  appeared  as  radiant  as  Mount  Sumeru  when  the 
moon  passes  over  the  summit  of  that  golden  peak. 

At  a  signal  from  Hanuman,  those  powerful  monkeys,  having 
placed  their  heads  at  the  feet  of  Raghava,  rising  one  after  the 
other,  went  away.

Sugriva,  who  held  Rama  in  a  firm  embrace,  and  the  virtuous 
Bibishana  were  shaking  with  sobs  and  all  were  weeping,  their 
eyes  brimming  with  tears,  beside  themselves,  distracted  with 
grief  as  it  were,  on  leaving  Raghava.  Overwhelmed  with  gifts 
by  the  magnanimous  Rama,  each  returned  to  his  own  country, 
as  souls  leave  the  body.  Titans,  bears  and  monkeys,  after 
bowing  to  Rama,  the  Increaser  of  the  glory  of  the  Raghu  Race, 
their  eyes  filled  with  tears,  caused  by  that  separation,  took  the 
road  to  their  own  countries. 


CHAPTER    41 

Rama  dismisses  the  Pushpaka  Chariot 

Having  said  farewell  to  the  bears,  the  monkeys  and  the  titans, 
the  long-armed  Rama  began  to  live  happily  with  his  brothers. 

One  day,  at  noon,  that  great  Prince  Raghava  heard  a  melodious 
voice  speaking  from  the  sky,  saying : — 

"  O  My  Friend  Rama,  look  on  me  and  know,  O  Prince,  that 
it  is  I,  Pushpaka,  who  come  from  Kuvera's  abode.  At  his 
command  I  have  returned  from  his  palace ;  it  is  he,  O  First  of 
Men,  who  has  told  me  to  place  myself  at  thy  service,  saying : — 

"  '  Thou  hast  been  won  by  the  magnanimous  Prince  Raghava 
in  the  fight  when  he  struck  down  Ravana,  that  invincible 
Monarch  of  the  Titans.  I  experienced  supreme  felicity  on  the 
slaying  of  that  wretch  with  his  forces,  sons  and  kinsfolk.  Having 
been  made  captive  in  Lanka  by  Rama,  the  Paramatman,  do  thou 
go  and  serve  him  as  a  vehicle,  O  Friend  !  It  is  I  who  command 
thee !  It  is  my  supreme  desire  that  thou  shouldst  carry  that 
hero,  the  Joy  of  the  Raghu  Race,  round  the  world ;  go  without 
anxiety! ' 

"  Obedient  to  the  behests  of  the  illustrious  Dhanada,  I  have 
reached  thee  without  difficulty  and  place  myself  at  thy  disposal. 
Inaccessible  to  all  beings,  at  Dhanada's  will,  in  obedience  to 
thy  commands  I  come  to  surrender  my  power  to  thy  service." 

Hearing  these  words,  the  valiant  Rama  answered  the  Pushpaka 
Car  in  the  sky,  that  had  returned  to  him,  saying : — 

<"■  517 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  O  Most  wonderful  of  chariots,  O  Pushpaka,  welcome  to 
thee ;  Dhanada's  generosity  must  not  find  me  wanting  !  " 

Thereafter  the  long-armed  Raghava  paid  homage  to  Pushpaka 
with  roasted  grain,  flowers  and  fragrant  perfumes,  saying : — 

"  Go  now,  O  Pushpaka,  wherever  thou  desirest  but  come 
again  whenever  I  call  thee  to  mind !  Go  by  the  path  of  the 
Siddhas,  O  Friend,  and  let  no  harm  come  to  thee.  Mayest  thou 
not  suffer  any  collision  in  thy  fantastic  journeyings  in  space, 
such  is  my  will !  " 

Rama,  having  dismissed  the  aerial  car  with  due  homage, 
Pushpaka  replying  (  So  be  it,'  went  wheresoever  it  desired  and, 
when  that  chariot  of  pure  soul  had  disappeared,  Bharata,  with. 
joined  palms,  addressed  his  elder  brother,  the  Joy  of  the  House 
of  Ragnu,  saying : — 

"  O  Hero,  thou  who  hast  the  soul  of  a  God,  under  thy  rule 
one  beholds  beings  who  are  not  of  the  human  race  speaking 
frequently,  nor  is  there  any  disease  among  men  and  their  days 
are  passed  in  peace ;  even  the  aged  do  not  die  and  women  give 
birth  without  pain,  whilst  all  enjoy  good  health.  A  real  felicity 
is  to  be  seen  among  the  citizens  and,  in  the  rainy  season, 
Parjanya  lets  loose  the  nectar  of  immortality ;  soft  auspicious  and 
balmy  breezes  blow  and  the  people  of  town  and  country  all 
exclaim  ( May  such  a  king  reign  over  us  long  *,  O  Prince !  " 

Hearing  these  gracious  and  nattering  words  spoken  by 
Bharata,  Rama,  the  foremost  of  monarchs,  was  supremely 
gratified. 


CHAPTER    42 

The  Felicity  enjoyed  by  Rama  and  Sita 

Having  dismissed  the  Pushpaka  Chariot,  which  was  encrusted 
with  gold,  the  long-armed  Rama  entered  the  Ashoka  Grove  that 
was  rendered  beautiful  by  Sandal,  Agallocha,  Mango,  Tunga 
and  Kalakeya  Trees  with  groves  of  Devadaru  on  all  sides,  whilst 
Champaka,  Aguru,  Punnaga,  Madhuka,  Panasa  and  Asana 
Trees  adorned  it  and  radiant  Parijatras  blazed  like  smokeless 
fires.  Lodhra,  Nipa,  Arjuna,  Naga,  Saptaparna,  Atimuktaka, 
518 


UTTARA    KANDA 

Mandara  and  Kadali  Trees  screened  it  with  a  web  of  thicket  and 
creepers ;  Priyangu,  Kadamba,  Bakula,  Jambu,  Dadima  and 
Kovidara  Trees  embellished  it  on  every  side  with  their  magnifi- 
cent flowers,  marvellous  fruits  of  celestial  fragrances,  divine 
nectar,  tender  shoots  and  buds.  Heavenly  trees  of  graceful 
shape,  thick  with  heavy  foliage  and  enchanting  blossom  were 
humming  with  intoxicated  bees.  Kokilas,  Bhringarajas  and 
other  birds  of  varied  plumage,  their  heads  crowned  with  pollen 
from  the  Mango  Trees,  added  to  the  beauty  of  those  marvellous 
woods.  Some  of  the  trees  had  the  brilliance  of  gold  or  resembled 
tongues  of  flame,  others  were  as  dark  as  collyrium  and  every- 
where only  flowers  of  sweet  fragrance  and  wreaths  of  blossom 
of  all  kinds  were  to  be  found. 

Fools  of  various  shapes,  filled  with  limpid  water  on  which 
tufts  of  flowering  lotus  and  water-lilies  floated,  were  approached 
by  steps  made  of  rubies.  Trees  in  full  flower  adorned  the  banks 
which  re-echoed  to  the  call  of  Datyuhas  and  Shukas  and  the 
cries  of  geese  and  swans.  That  grove  was  enclosed  by  flat  rocks 
of  differing  forms  within  which  were  many  grassy  glades  of  the 
sheen  of  emerald  and  pearl,  and  these  were  adorned  by  trees 
rivalling  each  other  in  the  profusion  of  their  blossom,  the  earth 
beneath  being  heaped  with  flowers,  resembling  the  sky  full  of 
stars,  so  that  it  appeared  like  the  garden  of  Indra  or  Chaitaratha 
created  by  Brahma. 

Such  was  Rama's  pastoral  retreat  with  its  arbours  filled  with 
countless  seats  and  grassy  couches  inviting  one  to  rest ;  and  the 
Increaser  of  Raghu's  joy  entered  that  magnificent  Ashoka  Grove 
and  seated  himself  on  a  throne  of  great  splendour  which  was 
decorated  with  innumerable  flowers  and  covered  with  a  carpet  of 
Kusha  Grass. 

Taking  Sita  by  the  hand,  Kakutstha  gave  her  delicious  wine 
made  of  distilled  honey  to  drink,  as  formerly  Purandara  had 
offered  to  Sachi.  Thereafter  pure  viands  and  fruits  of  every 
kind  were  brought  by  servants,  whilst  lovely  Apsaras,  skilled  in 
the  arts  of  singing  and  dancing,  began  to  perform  in  the  Prince's 
presence  and  troops  of  Nymphs  and  Uragas,  surrounded  by  the 
Kinneris  intoxicated  with  wine,  danced  before  Kakutstha,  and 
the  virtuous  Rama,  the  most  captivating  of  warriors,  delighted 
those  ravishing  and  charming  women. 
519 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Seated  by  Vaidehi,  he  was  radiant  with  splendour  and 
resembled  Vasishtha  at  the  side  of  Arundhati.  In  this  way,  in 
the  joy  that  possessed  him,  Rama,  like  unto  a  God,  each  day 
prepared  some  new  delight  for  Sita,  the  Princess  of  Videha,  who 
was  like  unto  the  daughter  of  a  Celestial  Being. 

While  Sita  and  Raghava  sported  thus  for  a  long  time,  the 
flowery  season,  that  yields  perpetual  enjoyment,  passed  away 
and,  as  those  two  tasted  every  kind  of  felicity,  Spring  appeared 
once  more.  One  day,  having  fulfilled  the  functions  of  state,  that 
virtuous  Prince  returned  to  his  palace  where  he  spent  the  rest  of 
the  day.  On  her  side,  Sita,  having  worshipped  the  Gods  and 
performed  her  morning  duties,  offering  her  services  to  all  her 
mothers-in-law  without  distinction,  thereafter  adorned  herself 
with  marvellous  jewels  and  re-joined  Rama,  like  unto  Sachi 
when  re-united  with  that  God  of  a  Thousand  Eyes  as  he  returns 
to  his  City  Trivishtapa. 

Beholding  his  consort  glowing  with  beauty,  Raghava  experi- 
enced an  unequalled  delight  and  exclaimed  "  It  is  well !  "  then 
he  addressed  the  lovely  Sita,  who  resembled  a  daughter  of  the 
Gods,  and  said  : — 

"  Now,  O  Vaidehi,  that  thou  dost  bear  a  child  in  thy  womb, 
what  dost  thou  desire,  O  Lady  of  lovely  hips  ?  What  pleasure 
can  I  prepare  for  thee  ?  " 

Smiling,  Vaidehi  answered  Rama,  saying ; — 

"  O  Raghava,  I  wish  to  visit  the  sacred  retreats  of  the  Rishis  of 
rigid  penances,  who  dwell  on  the  banks  of  the  Ganges  where 
they  subsist  on  fruit  and  roots,  and  there  I  will  throw  myself  at 
their  feet,  O  Lord.  O  Kakutstha,  it  is  my  supreme  desire  even 
to  pass  a  night  in  the  hermitage  of  these  ascetics  who  live  on 
fruit  and  roots." 

Then  Rama  of  imperishable  exploits  gave  her  permission  to 
do  so,  saying : — 

"  Be  at  peace,  O  Vaidehi,  to-morrow  without  fail,  thou  shalt 
go  there ! " 

Having  answered  Maithili,  born  of  Janaka,  in  this  wise, 
Kakutstha  went  to  the  central  court  surrounded  by  his  friends.

CHAPTER    43 

Rama  informs  himself  concerning  current 
Rumours  from  his  Friends 

Having  entered  there,  the  King  was  surrounded  by  entertaining 
companions  accustomed  to  the  exchange  of  humorous  experi- 
ences, Vijaya,  Madhumarra,  Kashyapa,  Mangala,  Kula,  Suraji, 
Kaliya,  Bhadra,  Dantavakra  and  Sumagadha,  and  they  beguiled 
the  magnanimous  Raghava  with  amusing  tales  of  every  kind 
amidst  great  merriment. 

Raghava,  however,  during  some  narrative,  enquired  of 
Bhadra,  saying : — 

"  O  Bhadra,  what  do  they  say  of  me  in  the  town  and  country  ? 
What  do  they  say  of  Site,  Bharata  and  Lakshmana  ?  What  do 
they  say  of  Shatrugnna  and  Kaikeyi  our  mother  ?  Kings  are 
always  the  subject  of  criticism  whether  they  are  in  the  forest  or 
on  the  throne." 

On  hearing  Rama's  enquiry,  Bhadra,  with  joined  palms, 
answered : — 

"Amongst  the  inhabitants  of  the  city,  nought  but  what  is 
good  is  spoken  of  thee,  O  King,  above  all  they  tell  of  thy  victory 
over  Dashagriva,  whom  thou  didst  slay,  O  Dear  Prince !  " 

At  these  words  of  Bhadra,  Raghava  said  : — 

"  Tell  me  all  truthfully  without  reserve,  what  reports,  good  or 
ill,  do  the  people  of  the  city  circulate  regarding  me  ?  When  I 
learn  of  them,  I  shall  endeavour  to  do  what  is  meet  in  the  future 
and  eschew  what  is  evil.  Tell  me  all  in  full  confidence  without 
fear.  Laying  aside  every  scruple,  relate  all  the  rumours  current 
about  me  in  the  kingdom  !  " 

Thus  exhorted  by  Raghava,  Bhadra,  with  joined  palms,  in 
profound  reverence,  addressed  that  mighty  hero  in  measured 
tones,  saying : — 

"  Hear,  O  King,  what  the  people  are  saying,  be  it  good  or  ill, 
in  the  highways,  markets,  streets,  woods  and  parks — *  Rama  has 
achieved  the  impossible  by  throwing  a  bridge  over  the  sea  which 
to  our  knowledge  was  never  done  by  his  predecessors  nor  even 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

by  the  Gods  and  Danavas  together.  With  his  foot-soldiers  and 
cavalry,  he  has  destroyed  the  invincible  Ravana  and  has  made  the 
monkeys,  bears  and  Rakshasas  subject  to  him.  Having  slain 
Ravana  in  the  fight  and  recovered  Sita,  Raghava,  having  mastered 
his  anger,  has  taken  his  spouse  into  his  house  again.  What 
pleasure  can  his  heart  experience  in  possessing  Sita,  whom 
Ravana  formerly  held  in  his  lap,  having  borne  her  away  by 
force  ?  How  is  it  that  Rama  was  not  filled  with  aversion  for 
her  after  she  had  been  taken  to  Lanka  and  conducted  to  the 
Ashoka  Grove,  where  she  was  left  to  the  mercy  of  the  titans  ? 
We  shall  now  have  to  countenance  the  same  state  of  affairs 
regarding  our  own  wives,  since  what  a  king  does,  his  subjects 
follow ! ' 

"  These  are  the  sayings  current  everywhere  among  the  people 
of  town  and  country,  O  King." 

At  these  words,  Raghava,  stricken  with  grief,  asked,  "  Is  it 
thus  that  they  speak  of  me  ?  " 

Then  all,  bowing  to  the  ground  in  reverence,  answered  the 
unfortunate  Raghava  and  said : — 

"  It  is  true,  O  Lord  of  the  Earth !  " 

Having  heard  their  unanimous  testimony,  Kakutstha,  the 
Scourge  of  His  Foes,  dismissed  his  companions.

Rama  summons  his  Brothers 

Having  dismissed  his  companions,  Raghava  began  to  ponder 
within  himself  and  thereafter  said  to  the  doorkeeper  who  stood 
near: — 

"  Go  speedily  and  seek  out  the  son  of  Sumitra,  Lakshmana  of 
auspicious  marks  and  the  fortunate  Bharata  and  the  invincible 
Shatrughna." 

At  Rama's  command,  the  janitor  paid  obeisance  with  joined 
palms  and  went  to  Lakshmana's  abode  which  he  entered  un- 
challenged and  there,  having  saluted  the  magnanimous  prince, 
he  said : — 

5» 


UTTARA    KANDA 

"  The  King  desires  to  sec  thee,  do  thou  go  to  him  without 
delay ! " 

"  It  is  well !  "  answered  Saumitri  and,  in  obedience  to  Rag- 
hava's  command,  he  ascended  a  chariot  and  hastened  to  the 
palace.  When  he  had  departed,  the  doorkeeper  approached 
Bharata  and,  saluting  him  in  a  like  manner,  said  : — 

"  The  king  respectfully  requests  thy  presence !  " 

Hearing  these  instructions  issued  by  Rama,  Bharata,  rising 
swiftly  from  his  seat,  started  out  hurriedly  on  foot.  Beholding 
the  virtuous  Bharata  going  away,  the  messenger  speedily 
approached  Shatrughna's  abode  and,  with  joined  palms, 
addressed  him,  saying : — 

"  Go  quickly,  O  Prince  of  the  Raghus,  the  king  wishes  to  see 
thee;  Lakshmana  has  already  preceded  thee  as  also  the  re- 
nowned Bharata." 

At  these  words,  Shatrughna  descended  from  his  throne  and, 
bowing  to  the  ground,  went  to  rejoin  Raghava. 

Meantime  the  messenger  having  returned,  paid  obeisance  to 
Rama  and  made  it  known  to  him  that  his  brothers  had  come. 
Learning  of  the  youthful  princes'  arrival,  Rama,  who  was  deeply 
troubled,  with  a  downcast  mien,  sad  at  heart,  said  to  the  door- 
keeper : — 

"  Make  haste  and  usher  them  into  my  presence !  Mine 
existence  depends  on  them,  they  are  my  very  life's  breath !  " 

At  this  command  from  that  Indra  of  Men,  the  princes,  attired 
in  white,  bowed  with  joined  palms  and  entered  respectfully.  On 
beholding  Rama,  who  resembled  the  moon  in  eclipse  or  the  sun 
that  the  dusk  robs  of  its  splendour,  whose  eyes  were  filled  with 
tears  and  who  looked  like  a  lotus  bereft  of  its  brilliance,  they 
placed  their  heads  at  his  feet  and  then  stood  silent.  Thereupon 
the  mighty  Rama,  shedding  tears,  having  raised  them  up, 
clasped  them  in  his  arms  and  said  to  them : — 

"  Be  seated  !  You  are  my  whole  wealth,  you  are  my  very  life ! 
It  is  with  your  assistance  that  I  attained  a  kingdom  and  now 
rule,  O  Princes  !  " 

Thus  spoke  Kakutstha  and  all,  attentive  and  deeply  moved, 
wondered  what  words  he  might  be  about  to  address  to  them.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER    45 

Rama  commands  Lakshmana  to  take  Sita  to  the  Hermitage 

All  having  taken  their  places  fall  of  sadness,  Kakutstha,  his 
features  stricken,  said  to  them : — 

"  Hear  me  all  of  you,  may  good  betide  you  !  Do  not  let  your 
attention  wander !  This  is  what  people  are  saying  about  me 
concerning  Sita  !  The  inhabitants  of  the  city  as  also  those  of 
the  country  censure  me  severely  and  their  criticism  pierces  my 
heart !  I  am  born  in  the  Race  of  the  illustrious  Ikshvakus  and 
Sita  belongs  to  the  family  of  the  great-souled  Janaka.  My  Dear 
Lakshmana,  thou  knowest  how,  in  the  lonely  forest,  Ravana  bore 
Sita  away  and  that  I  destroyed  him.  It  was  then  that  the 
thought  came  to  me  regarding  the  daughter  of  Janaka, '  How  can 
I  bring  Sita  back  to  Ayodhya  from  this  place  ?  '  Thereupon,  in 
order  to  re-assure  me,  Sita  entered  the  fire  in  my  presence  and 
that  of  the  Gods,  O  Saumitri !  Agni,  the  Bearer  of  sacrificial 
offerings,  witnessed  to  Maithili's  innocence  and  Vayu  also, 
who  was  then  journeying  through  space,  and  Chandra  and 
Aditya  proclaimed  it  formerly  before  the  Gods  and  all  the  Rishis, 
that  the  daughter  of  Janaka  was  without  fault.  The  Gods  and 
Gandharvas  testified  to  her  pure  conduct  in  Lanka,  where 
Mahendra  placed  the  proofs  in  my  hand,  further  I  knew  from 
my  own  inner  being  that  the  illustrious  Sita  was  innocent.  It 
was  then  that  I  took  her  back  and  returned  to  Ayodhya.  Since 
then  a  great  sadness,  on  hearing  the  censure  of  the  people  of 
town  and  country,  has  filled  my  heart.  Whoever  it  may  be,  if 
his  ill  fame  be  current  in  the  world,  he  falls  to  a  lower  state,  so 
long  as  the  defamatory  rumours  exist.  Dishonour  is  condemned 
by  the  Gods  ;  honour  is  revered  in  the  world  and,  it  is  on  account 
of  fair  repute,  that  great  souls  act.  As  for  me,  so  greatly  do  I 
fear  dishonour  that  I  would  renounce  my  life  and  you  yourselves 
on  its  account,  O  Bulls  among  Men,  how  much  more  therefore 
is  it  incumbent  on  me  to  separate  myself  from  the  daughter  of 
Janaka.  See  therefore  in  what  an  ocean  of  grief  I  have  fallen  1

O  Saumitri,  take  my  chariot  with  Suraantra  as  thy  charioteer 
and,  causing  Sita  to  ascend  it,  leave  her  beyond  the  confines  of 
the  kingdom. 

"  On  the  further  side  of  the  Ganges,  the  magnanimous 
Valmiki  has  his  hermitage  of  celestial  aspect  situated  by  the 
Tamasa  ;  it  is  in  a  solitary  spot  that  thou  shouldst  leave  her,  O 
Thou  who  art  the  Joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu.  Go  quickly,  O 
Saumitri,  and  carry  out  my  behest.  Do  not  discuss  it  in  any 
way ;  go  therefore,  O  Saumitri,  it  is  not  the  time  for  observa- 
tions. Any  resistence  on  thy  part  will  cause  me  extreme  dis- 
pleasure. Yea,  I  swear  to  thee  by  my  two  feet,  by  my  life,  that 
those  who  seek  to  make  me  alter  my  resolve  in  any  way  or 
oppose  my  desire,  I  shall  deem  to  be  mine  enemies.  If  you  are 
subject  to  me  and  hold  me  in  reverence,  then  obey  me  and  take 
Sita  away  from  here  this  very  day.  Formerly  she  appealed  to 
me  saying,  *  I  wish  to  visit  the  sacred  retreats  of  the  banks  of  the 
Ganges  ',  let  her  wish  be  fulfilled  !  " 

Having  spoken  thus,  the  virtuous  Kakutstha,  his  eyes  filled 
with  tears,  re-entered  his  apartments  escorted  by  his  brothers, 
his  heart  riven  with  grief,  sighing  like  an  elephant 


chapter   46 

Lakshmana  takes  Sita  away 

When  the  night  had  passed,  Lakshmana,  with  a  sad  heart  and 
downcast  mien,  said  to  Sumantra  : — 

"  O  Charioteer,  harness  swift  horses  to  the  most  excellent  of 
cars  and,  by  the  king's  orders,  prepare  a  comfortable  and 
luxurious  seat  for  Sita,  she,  in  accord  with  the  king's  wish,  under 
my  charge,  is  to  visit  the  retreats  of  the  great  Rishis  of  pious 
practices,  therefore  bring  hither  the  chariot  with  all  speed  !  " 

Then  Sumantra  saying,  "  Be  it  so  1  "  yoked  some  superb 
horses  to  a  splendid  chariot  that  was  well  furnished  with 
cushions  and,  approaching  Saumitri,  the  heaper  of  honours  on 
his  friends,  he  said : — 

"  The  car  is  ready,  let  what  must  be  accomplished  be  done,  O 
Lord  1 " 

5*5 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

At  these  words  of  Sumantra,  Lakshmana  re-entered  the  King's 
palace  and,  having  approached  Sita,  that  Bull  among  Men 
addressed  her  thus  : — 

"According  to  the  wish  that  thou  didst  express  to  him,  that 
Lord  of  Men,  the  king,  has  charged  me  to  take  thee  to  the 
desired  retreats.  At  the  request  of  our  sovereign,  I  will  conduct 
thee  without  delay  to  those  excellent  solitudes  of  the  Rishis  on 
the  banks  of  the  Ganges,  O  Divine  Vaidehi.  I  shall  take  thee 
to  those  hermitages  inhabited  by  the  Sages." 

At  these  words  of  the  magnanimous  Lakshmana,  Vaidehi 
experienced  supreme  felicity,  so  greatly  did  the  thought  of  the 
expedition  please  her  and,  having  furnished  herself  with  costly 
raiment  and  jewels  of  every  kind,  she  prepared  to  depart, 
saying : — 

"  I  shall  give  these  jewels  as  also  the  excellent  robes  and 
various  treasures  to  the  wives  of  the  ascetics." 

"  It  is  well ",  said  Saumitri,  causing  Maithili  to  ascend  the 
chariot  and,  recollecting  Rama's  command,  he  went  forward 
drawn  by  swift  horses. 

Thereafter  Sita  said  to  Lakshmana,  the  increaser  of  prosperity : 

"  I  behold  countless  inauspicious  omens,  O  Joy  of  the  House 
of  Raghu,  observe  how  my  left  eye  twitches  and  all  my  limbs 
tremble,  further  my  mind  is  confused  and  I  feel  extremely 
restless  whilst  all  my  courage  has  ebbed  away,  O  Saumitri.  The 
earth  appears  deserted,  O  Large-eyed  Prince,  can  thy  brother 
be  happy,  O  Thou  who  art  so  devoted  to  him  ?  May  all  be  well 
with  my  mothers-in-law  without  distinction,  O  Hero  !  May  all 
beings  in  town  and  country  be  happy !  " 

Thus,  with  joined  palms,  Sita,  the  divine  Maithili  prayed, 
and  Lakshmana  listening,  bent  his  head  and,  though  his  heart  was 
contracted  with  grief,  he  cried  in  joyous  accents,  "  Mayest  thou 
too  be  happy  !  " 

Meantime  they  reached  the  banks  of  the  Gaumati  and  rested 
in  a  hermitage,  and  the  following  day,  at  dawn,  Saumitri, 
rising,  said  to  the  charioteer  : — 

"  Harness  the  car  speedily  !  To-day,  with  great  strength,  I 
shall  bear  the  waters  of  the  Bhagirathj  on  my  head,  as  did 
Tryambaka."1 

1  Tryambaka — the  Lord  Shiva.

UTTARA    KANDA 

Thus  commanded,  the  driver  with  joined  palms,  said  to 
Vaidehi : — 
"  Mount ! "  and  he  gave  rein  to  the  horses  yoked  to  the 

chariot,  who  were  as  swift  as  thought,  whereupon  she,  hearing 
the  voice  of  the  charioteer,  ascended  that  excellent  car.  There- 
after the  large-eyed  Sita  accompanied  by  Saumitri  and  Sumantra 
reached  the  Ganges,  that  destroys  all  sin  and,  arriving  there  at 
noon,  beholding  the  waters  of  the  Bhagirathi,  the  unfortunate 
Lakshmana  began  to  weep  openly  in  his  profound  distress  and 
die  virtuous  Sita,  in  her  extreme  solicitude,  observing  Laksh- 
mana's  misery,  enquired  of  him,  saying : — 

"  Wherefore  art  thou  groaning  ?  We  have  reached  the  banks 
of  the  Jahnavi,  the  object  of  my  desires  for  a  long  time  and,  at 
the  moment  of  rejoicing,  why  dost  thou  cause  me  pain  in  this 
wise,  O  Lakshmana  ?  O  Bull  among  Men,  is  thy  grief  on  account 
of  these  two  days  absence  from  Rama,  thou  who  art  ever  in 
attendance  on  him  ?  Rama  is  dearer  to  me  than  life,  O  Laksh- 
mana, yet  I  do  not  distress  myself ;  do  not  behave  like  a  child ! 
Let  us  cross  the  Ganges  and  visit  the  Sages  so  that  I  may 
distribute  the  raiment  and  jewels.  Having  paid  homage  to  the 
great  Rishis,  which  we  owe  to  them  and,  passing  one  day 
there,  we  shall  return  to  the  city.  My  heart  is  impatient  to  see 
Rama  again,  whose  eyes  are  like  the  petals  of  a  lotus,  whose  chest 
is  like  a  lion's,  that  foremost  of  men  !  " 

At  these  words  of  Sita's,  Lakshmana,  wiping  his  beautiful 
eyes,  hailed  the  ferrymen  and  they,  with  joined  palms,  said 
°  The  boat  is  ready !  " 

Eager  to  cross  over  that  splendid  river,  Lakshmana  boarded 
the  skiff,  and  his  mind  pre-occupied,  took  Sita  across  the  Ganges. 


CHAPTER  47 

Lakshmana  tells  Sita  she  has  been  repudiated 

The  younger  brother  of  Raghava,  having  first  assisted  Maithili 
to  board  it,  entered  the  well-furnished  boat  ready  to  depart, 
thereafter  he  said  to  Sumantra,  "  Wait  here  with  the  chariot  " 
and,  overcome  with  grief,  he  commanded  the  craft  to  set  sail.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Arriving  at  the  farther  bank  of  the  Bhagirathi,  Lakshmana, 
with  joined  palms,  his  nice  bathed  in  tears,  said : — 

"A  stake  has  been  driven  into  my  heart  by  the  noble  and 
virtuous  Rama,  which  will  bring  universal  censure  upon  me. 
Death  were  better  for  me  this  day,  verily  death  would  be 
preferable  to  the  mission  on  which  I  am  engaged,  which  the 
world  will  condemn.  Forgive  me  and  do  not  impute  this 
offence  to  me,  O  Illustrious  Princess." 

Thereafter,  making  obeisance,  Lakshmana  threw  himself  on 
the  earth.  Seeing  him  weep,  paying  her  homage  and  calling  on 
death,  Maithili,  alarmed,  said  to  Lakshmana  :— 

"  What  is  this  ?  I  do  not  understand  anything ;  tell  me  the 
truth,  O  Lakshmana,  why  art  thou  agitated  ?  Is  the  king  well  ? 
Tell  me  the  cause  of  thy  grief !  " 

Thus  questioned  by  Vaidehi,  Lakshmana,  his  heart  filled 
with  anguish,  with  bowed  head,  choked  with  sobs,  addressed 
her  saying : — 

"  Having  learnt  in  open  council  that  he  was  the  object  of 
severe  censure  in  the  city  and  country  on  thine  account,  O 
Daughter  of  Janaka,  Rama,  his  heart  riven,  returning  home  told 
me  of  it.  I  am  unable  to  repeat  the  things  spoken  in  confidence 
to  me,  O  Queen.  Although  thou  art  blameless  in  mine  eyes, 
the  king  has  repudiated  thee.  Public  condemnation  has  per- 
turbed him  ;  do  not  misunderstand  the  matter,  O  Goddess.  I 
am  to  leave  thee  in  the  vicinity  of  the  sacred  hermitages.  The 
king  has  commanded  me  to  do  so  on  the  pretext  of  satisfying  thy 
desire.  The  ascetics'  retreats  on  the  banks  of  the  Jahnavi  are 
sacred  and  enchanting,  do  not  give  way  to  grief,  O  Lovely  One. 
The  foremost  of  Rishis,  the  supremely  illustrious  Sage  Valmiki 
was  a  great  friend  of  thy  sire,  King  Dasaratha.  Taking  refuge 
under  the  shadow  of  the  feet  of  that  magnanimous  One  and 
living  in  chastity,  be  happy,  O  Daughter  of  Janaka.  It  is  by 
remaining  faithful  to  thy  Lord  and  practising  devotion  to  Rama 
in  thine  heart  that  thou  shalt,  by  thy  conduct,  acquire  supreme 
felicity,  O  Goddess."

CHAPTER    48 

Lakshmana  leaves  Sita  on  the  Banks  of  the  Ganges 

Hearing  Lakshmana's  harsh  words,  the  daughter  of  Janaka, 
overcome  with  despair,  fell  to  the  ground  but,  regaining  con- 
sciousness after  a  time,  her  eyes  bathed  in  tears,  she  addressed 
him  in  broken  accents,  saying : — 

"Assuredly  this  body  of  mine  has  been  created  for  misfortune 
and  is  its  supporter  from  this  time  forward.  What  sin  can  I  have 
committed  in  days  gone  by  or  whom  did  I  separate  from  her 
husband,  that  I,  who  am  virtuous  and  chaste,  should  be  cast  off 
by  the  king  ? 

"  Formerly  I  lived  in  the  forest  following  in  Rama's  footsteps 
and  was  content  in  the  misfortune  in  which  I  found  myself,  O 
Prince,  now,  how  can  I,  abandoned  by  all,  live  in  solitude,  O 
dear  Lakshmana  ?  To  whom  shall  I  confide  the  affliction  that 
has  overwhelmed  me  ?  What  can  I  say  to  the  ascetics,  O  Lord  ? 
For  what  sin,  for  what  reason,  am  I  repudiated  by  the  magnani- 
mous Raghava  ?  I  may  not  yield  up  my  life  in  the  waters  of  the 
Ganges,  lest  I  bring  the  royal  line  to  an  end !  Therefore  do 
what  thou  hast  been  commanded,  O  Saumitri,  leave  me  to  my 
wretched  plight !  It  is  for  thee  to  carry  out  the  king's  behests, 
yet  hear  me — do  thou  with  joined  palms  pay  homage  to  all  my 
mothers-in-law  and,  having  worshipped  his  feet,  address  the 
king.  With  bowed  head,  speak  to  them  all,  O  Lakshmana,  and 
do  thou  also  say  to  the  king,  who  is  ever  fixed  in  his  duty,  *  O 
Raghava,  thou  knowest  I  am  truly  pure  and  that  I  have  been 
bound  to  thee  in  supreme  love,  yet  thou  hast  renounced  me  in 
fear  of  dishonour,  because  thy  subjects  have  reproached  and 
censured  thee,  O  Hero.  Thou  shouldst,  however  have  spared 
me,  since  thou  art  my  only  refuge.'  Further,  thou  shouldst  say 
to  the  king  who  is  established  in  righteousness,  'As  thou  dost  act 
in  regard  to  thy  brothers,  so  shouldst  thou  act  in  regard  to  thy 
subjects ;  this  is  pre-eminently  thy  duty  and  will  bring  thee 
immeasurable  renown ;  by  its  observance  thou  wilt  enjoy  the 
fruits  of  the  earth !  As  for  me,  I  am  not  distressed  on  mine  own 
5*9 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

account,  0  Prince  of  Raghu,  it  is  for  thee  to  keep  thy  fair  name 
untarnished  !  The  husband  is  as  a  God  to  the  woman,  he  is  her 
family,  and  her  spiritual  preceptor,  therefore,  even  at  the  price 
of  her  life,  she  must  seek  to  please  her  lord.' 

"  Repeat  these  words  to  Rama,  it  is  all  I  ask  of  thee.  Having 
borne  witness  that  I  am  far  advanced  in  pregnancy,  do  thou 
depart." 

So  did  Sita  speak  and  Lakshmana,  sad  at  heart,  bowed  to  the 
earth  without  being  able  to  answer  her.  Thereafter  he  circum- 
ambulated her  sobbing  aloud  and,  after  reflecting  awhile,  said  :— 

"  What  hast  thou  said,  O  Beautiful  Princess,  I  have  never 
raised  mine  eyes  to  thy  face  and  have  ever  but  looked  on  thy  feet, 
O  Irreproachable  One.  How  should  I,  in  his  absence,  dare  to 
gaze  upon  the  one  Rama  has  abandoned  in  the  lonely  forest  ?  " 

With  these  words,  he  paid  obeisance  to  her  and  re-entered  the 
boat.    Boarding  the  skiff,  he  urged  the  ferryman  on,  saying  : — 

"  Cross  to  the  farther  shore." 

Beside  himself  with  grief,  in  deep  affliction,  he,  having  reached 
the  other  bank  proceeded  in  his  swiftly  moving  chariot,  turning 
round  again  and  again  to  gaze  on  Sita,  who,  as  if  bereft  of  all 
support,  was  wandering  about  distraught  on  the  farther  side  of 
the  Ganges.  Her  eyes  fixed  on  the  chariot  and  on  Lakshmana, 
now  far  distant,  Sita  was  overcome  with  grief,  and,  crushed  by 
the  weight  of  her  misfortune,  the  illustrious,  noble  and  virtuous 
woman,  seeing  herself  without  a  protector  in  the  forest,  that 
re-echoed  to  the  cry  of  peacocks,  a  prey  to  despair,  burst  into 
loud  sobs. 


CHAPTER    49 

VcUmiki  offers  Sita  fas  Protection 

Beholding  Sita  who  was  sobbing,  the  sons  of  the  Rishis  ran  to 
seek  out  the  blessed  Valmiki  of  rigid  penances  and,  having  paid 
obeisance  to  the  feet  of  that  great  ascetic,  the  children  of  the 
Sages  informed  him  that  a  woman  was  weeping  nearby, 
saying:— 
"  O  Lord,  a  lady  resembling  Shri,  whom  we  have  never  before 
530 


UTTARA    KANDA 

seen  and  who  must  be  the  consort  of  some  great  man,  her 
features  distorted,  is  lamenting  in  the  vicinity  of  the  hermitage  ! 
O  Blessed  One,  thou  wilt  surely  deem  her  to  be  a  goddess  fallen 
from  heaven !  Verily  the  most  lovely  of  women,  in  deep 
distress,  appeared  before  us  on  the  bank  of  a  river,  shedding 
scalding  tears,  overcome  by  grief.  In  this  misfortune  that  was 
assuredly  not  merited,  she  is  alone  and  without  a  protector.  We 
do  not  know  the  lady  but  do  thou  receive  her  with  kindness  tor 
she  is  close  to  this  retreat  and  has  come  to  take  refuge  with  thee." 

Valmiki,  that  Prince  of  Sages,  being  aware  of  everything  by 
virtue  of  his  asceticism,  ascertaining  the  truth  of  their  words, 
with  rapid  steps  went  to  where  the  Queen  was  weeping,  and,  as 
he  strode  forward,  the  disciples  followed  that  illustrious  Muni. 

Bearing  the  Arghya  in  his  hands,  proceeding  on  foot,  the 
sagacious  Valmiki  reached  the  banks  of  the  river  and  beheld 
Raghava's  beloved  consort  lamenting  like  one  bereft.  Thereafter, 
having  consoled  her  by  virtue  of  his  holiness,  the  great  ascetic 
addressed  her  in  a  sweet  voice,  saying : — 

"  O  Virtuous  Lady,  thou  art  the  daughter-in-law  of  King 
Dasaratha,  Rama's  beloved  consort,  the  daughter  of  Janaka  !  O 
Faithful  One,  by  virtue  of  my  meditations,  the  cause  that  brings 
thee  here  has  been  revealed  to  me.  O  Auspicious  One,  I  am 
fully  aware  of  thy  purity,  for  all  that  comes  to  pass  in  the  Three 
Worlds  is  known  to  me.  By  my  spiritual  vision,  I  am  convinced 
of  thy  chaste  conduct,  O  Daughter  of  Janaka ;  thou  art  under 
my  protection,  O  Vaidehi,  take  comfort !  Not  far  from  mine 
hermitage  there  are  many  female  ascetics  established  in  pious 
practices,  they  will  care  for  thee  as  for  their  own  daughter,  O 
Dear  Child.  Now  accept  the  Arghya  and  trust  in  me,  giving  up 
all  anxiety.    Do  not  grieve  but  look  on  this  as  thine  abode." 

Hearing  these  excellent  words  from  the  Sage,  Sita,  paying 
obeisance  to  his  feet,  with  joined  palms,  accompanied  the 
ascetic. 

Beholding  the  Sage  approaching,  followed  by  Vaidehi,  the 
female  ascetics  came  out  to  meet  them  and,  filled  with  delight, 
said: — 

"  O  Foremost  among  the  Sages,  be  thou  welcome ;  it  is  long 
since  thou  hast  visited  us,  we  bow  down  to  thee,  what  axe  thy 
commands  ?  " 

531 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Hearing  their  words,  Valmiki  answered  : — 

"  This  lady  is  Sita,  the  consort  of  the  virtuous  Rama,  she  is 
the  daughter-in-law  of  King  Dasaratha,  the  chaste  daughter  of 
Janaka.  Though  innocent,  her  husband  has  renounced  her,  we 
should  all  therefore  protect  her ;  she  is  worthy  of  our  affection  ! 
Such  is  my  wish,  who  am  your  spiritual  preceptor;  at  my 
behest,  do  ye  pay  her  every  honour." 

Having  placed  Sita  in  the  charge  of  those  female  ascetics,  the 
great  and  illustrious  Sage  Valmiki,  followed  by  his  disciples, 
returned  to  his  hermitage.

"  See  into  what  affliction  Sita's  plight  has  thrown  Rama ! 
What  could  be  sadder  for  Raghava  than  to  have  to  renounce  the 
daughter  of  Janaka,  a  chaste  wife  ?  It  is  evident  to  me  that  fete 
has  separated  Raghava  from  Vaidebi !  O  Charioteer,  destiny  is 
inexorable  I  Raghava,  who,  in  his  wrath,  slew  the  Gods, 
Gandharvas,  Asuras  and  Rakshasas,  is  under  the  sway  of  destiny. 
Formerly  Rama,  at  his  father's  command,  dwelt  in  the  vast  and 
lonely  Dandaka  Forest  for  fourteen  years,  but  more  painful  and 
cruel  to  me  seems  the  repudiation  of  Sita  through  listening  to  the 
calumny  of  the  people.  What  justification  was  there,  O  Suta, 
for  this  dishonourable  procedure  consequent  on  the  ill-considered 
reports  regarding  Maithili  ?  " 

Hearing  these  words  uttered  by  Lakshmana,  the  loyal  and 
sagacious  Sumantra  answered : — 

"  Do  not  grieve  about  Maithili,  O  Son  of  Sumitra,  O  Laksh- 
mana, it  was  formerly  predicted  by  the  brahmins  to  thy  Sire. 
Assuredly  Rama  is  destined  to  become  extremely  unhappy ; 
misfortune  is  his  lot !  Undoubtedly  that  long-armed  hero  will 
be  separated  from  all  those  he  loves.  Under  the  sway  of  destiny, 
that  great  man  will  renounce  thee,  Shatrughna  and  Bharata.  Do 
not  repeat  to  Bharata  or  Shatrughna  what  Durvasa  uttered  in 
reply  to  the  king  who  was  questioning  him.  It  was  in  the 
presence  of  a  large  assembly  when  I  was  present,  O  Bull  among 
Men,  that  the  Rishi  uttered  these  words,  Vasishtha  himself, 
with  others,  being  there. 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  the  Rishi,  the  foremost  of  men, 
Dasaratha,  then  charged  me  saying,  '  Do  not  repeat  anything 
that  thou  hast  heard  to  others ' — I  have  kept  his  command 
scrupulously  and,  as  I  see  it,  under  no  circumstances  should  I 
divulge  the  matter  to  any,  yet,  if  I  can  trust  thy  discretion,  O 
Dear  One,  then  hear  me,  O  Joy  of  the  Raghus.  If  I  repeat  the 
secret  formerly  confided  to  me  by  King  Dasaratha  then  it  is  fate 
and  inevitable.  It  is  on  account  of  fate  that  a  similar  misfortune, 
the  source  of  thy  present  distress,  took  place.  Do  not  speak  of 
it  before  Bharata  or  in  Shatrughna's  presence  either," 

When  he  heard  those  grave  and  portentous  words  of  Suman- 
tra's,  Saumitri  said  to  the  charioteer, "  Tell  me  the  whole  truth !"

CHAPTER    5  I 

Vishnu  is  cursed  by  Bhrigu 

Thus  requested  by  the  high-souled  Lakshmana,  the  charioteer 
began  to  relate  what  the  ascetic  had  said. 

"  Formerly  a  great  Sage,  named  Durvasa,  the  son  of  Atri, 
passed  the  rainy  season  in  Vasishtha's  hermitage.  Thy  supremely 
illustrious  Sire  went  there  himself,  desirous  of  beholding  the 
magnanimous  family  priest  and  he  observed  the  great  ascetic, 
Durvasa,  bright  as  the  sun,  radiant  in  his  own  effulgence,  seated 
by  the  side  of  Vasishtha.  Those  two  Sages,  the  foremost  of 
ascetics,  saluted  him  with  respect  and  bade  him  welcome, 
honouring  him  with  a  seat,  fruit  and  roots,  and  water  wherewith 
to  wash  his  feet.  Thereafter  he  dwelt  in  their  company  and 
the  illustrious  Rishis  there  present,  at  noon,  used  to  recount 
pleasing  traditions,  and  once  during  their  recital,  the  king,  with 
joined  palms,  said  to  the  magnanimous  ascetic,  the  son  of 
Atri:— 

" '  O  Blessed  One,  how  long  will  my  dynasty  endure  ?  To 
what  age  will  Rama  live  ?  And  my  other  sons,  how  long  will 
they  survive  ?  How  long  will  the  sons  of  Rama  live  ?  Be  so 
good  as  to  tell  me  the  destiny  of  my  race,  O  Blessed  Lord.' 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  King  Dasaratha,  the  highly  effulgent 
Durvasa  began  to  speak  thus  : — 

" '  Learn,  O  King,  what  happened  formerly  during  the 
conflict  between  the  Devas  and  Asuras.  The  Daityas,  whom  the 
Suras  threatened,  took  refuge  with  the  consort  of  Bhrigu  and 
she,  having  given  them  a  haven,  they  dwelt  there  in  safety. 
Seeing  them  thus  succoured,  the  Chief  of  the  Gods,  enraged, 
with  his  sharp-edged  discus  severed  the  head  of  Bhrigu's  wife. 

'"Beholding  the  murder  of  his  consort,  Bhrigu,  in  his  wrath, 
instantly  cursed  Vishnu,  the  destroyer  of  enemy  hosts,  saying : — 

'""Since  in  thine  insensate  fury,  thou  hast  slain  my  spouse, 
who  should  never  have  died  thus,  thou  shalt  take  birth  in  the 
world  of  men,  O  Janardana,  and  there  thou  shalt  live  separated 
from  thy  consort  for  many  years." 
535 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  *  Having  pronounced  this  curse,  Bhrigu  was  overcome  with 
remorse  and  his  merits  being  exhausted  by  the  malediction  he 
had  uttered,  he  began  to  propitiate  that  God,  paying  homage  to 
the  One  who  delights  in  penance  and  protects  his  devotees. 
Thereafter  that  God  spoke,  saying,  "  For  the  good  of  the  worlds, 
I  will  be  subject  to  thy  curse." 

"  '  This  is  how  the  illustrious  Vishnu  was  cursed  by  Bhrigu 
in  days  of  yore  and  descended  on  earth,  becoming  thy  son,  0 
Foremost  of  Monarchs.  Renowned  in  the  Three  Worlds  under 
the  name  of  Rama,  he  has  to  undergo  the  dire  consequences  of 
Bhrigu's  curse.  He  will  reign  in  Ayodhya  for  a  long  time. 
Those  who  follow  him  will  be  happy  and  prosperous  and,  having 
reigned  for  eleven  thousand  years,  Rama  will  go  to  Brahmaloka. 
Having  performed  many  great  sacrifices,  distributing  cosdy 
gifts,  he,  who  may  not  be  overcome  by  the  most  powerful 
beings,  shall  establish  many  dynasties  and  he  will  beget  two  sons 
by  Sita.' 

"  Having  related  all  concerning  the  past  and  future  of  his  race 
to  Ring  Dasaratha,  Durvasa  fell  silent,  whereupon  the  king  paid 
obeisance  to  the  two  magnanimous  ascetics  and  returned  to  the 
city. 

"  This  is  what  I  was  formerly  told  by  the  Risbi  and  I  have 
kept  it  in  my  heart ;  none  of  these  things  could  have  happened 
otherwise.  Sita's  two  sons  will  be  installed  in  Ayodhya  by 
Raghava,  the  words  of  a  Sage  never  fail  to  be  fulfilled.  It  being 
so,  do  not  grieve  either  for  Sita  or  for  Rama,  O  Son  of  Raghu. 
Take  courage,  O  Prince." 

Hearing  this  remarkable  speech  of  the  charioteer's,  Lakshmana 
experienced  unsurpassed  felicity  and  cried  out,  "Excellent! 
Excellent ! " 

Meantime  while  Lakshmana  and  the  charioteer  were  thus 
conversing  on  the  way,  the  sun  set  and  they  halted  on  the  banks 
of  the  Keshini  River.

CHAPTER    52 

Lakskmana  seeks  out  Rama 

Having  passed  the  night  by  the  Keshini,  Lakshmana,  the  Joy  of 
the  House  of  Raghu,  rose  at  dawn  and  continued  on  his  way. 

At  noon,  that  Prince  of  the  Great  Car  entered  the  opulent  City 
of  Ayodhya,  crowded  with  happy  people.  The  extremely 
sagacious  Saumitri,  however,  became  exceedingly  apprehensive, 
reflecting  "  On  mine  arrival,  when  I  fall  at  Rama's  feet,  what 
shall  I  say  to  him  ?  "  As  he  was  thus  anxiously  pondering, 
Rama's  residence,  bright  as  the  moon,  rose  before  him,  and  the 
prince,  dismounting  at  the  door  of  the  palace,  his  heart  con- 
tracted, with  bowed  head  entered  without  hindrance.  Seeing 
his  elder  brother,  Rama,  seated  on  his  throne  in  deep  distress, 
Lakshmana's  eyes  were  filled  with  tears  and,  seizing  hold  of  his 
feet,  his  soul  afflicted,  with  great  reverence  he  offered  obeisance 
to  him  and  addressed  him  in  plaintive  accents,  saying : — 

"  In  accord  with  thy  command,  O  Lord,  I  left  the  daughter  of 
Janaka  on  the  banks  of  the  Ganges  near  the  splendid  retreat  of 
the  Sage  Valmiki,  following  the  counsel  given  to  me.  It  is  there 
at  the  entrance  of  the  hermitage  that  I  abandoned  the  chaste  Sita 
and  have  returned  to  serve  thee.  Do  not  grieve,  O  Foremost  of 
Men,  it  has  been  decreed  by  destiny.  Assuredly  those  like  thee, 
who  are  intelligent  and  wise,  do  not  give  way  to  despair.  All 
growth  ends  in  decay,  those  who  rise  high,  fall,  and  all  meetings 
end  in  separation  ;  death  is  the  end  of  life.  Therefore  in  regard 
to  sons,  wives,  kinsfolk  and  wealth,  detachment  should  be 
practised,  for  separation  from  them  all  is  certain.  Thou  who  art 
able  to  control  the  spirit  by  the  spirit  and  the  mind  by  the  mind 
and  all  the  worlds,  O  Kakutstha,  how  much  more  art  thou  able 
to  control  grief.  Nay,  nay,  in  similar  circumstances,  the  fore- 
most of  men,  like  thyself,  do  not  distress  themselves.  Assuredly 
thou  wilt  be  censured  anew,  O  Raghava,  for  giving  way  to  grief 
on  account  of  calumny.  Undoubtedly  the  people  will  condemn 
thee.  O  Best  of  Men,  thou  who  art  so  well  endowed  with 
firmness  of  purpose,  give  up  this  faint-heartedness  and  cease  to 
grieve."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  magnanimous  Lakshmana,  the  son 
of  Sumitra,  Kakutstha,  beloved  of  his  friends,  answered  him  in 
cheerful  tones,  saying : — 

"  It  shall  be  as  thou  sayest,  O  Best  of  Men,  O  Valiant  Laksh- 
mana, I  am  gratified  by  the  execution  of  my  behests,  O  Hero.  O 
Gentle  Prince,  my  distress  has  been  assuaged  by  thy  felicitous 
words ;  I  shall  be  guided  by  them,  O  Saumitri." 


chapter    53 

Rama  tells  Lakshmana  the  Story  of  Nriga 

Hearing  Lakshmana's  remarkable  speech  that  filled  him  with 
amazement,  Rama  replied  : — 

"Assuredly  it  would  be  difficult  in  these  times  to  find  a 
relative  like  thee,  O  Dear  Brother!  O  Thou  who  bearest 
auspicious  marks,  who  art  gifted  with  intelligence  and  art  one 
with  me  in  thought,  now  learn  all  that  is  passing  in  my  heart  and, 
knowing  it,  do  what  I  command  thee. 

"  O  Dear  Saumitri,  four  days  have  gone  by  since  I  concerned 
myself  with  the  interests  of  my  people  and  my  soul  is  tormented  ; 
now  call  together  my  subjects,  the  family  priests  and  also  the 
ministers  with  all  those  to  whose  affairs  attention  must  be  given  ! 
The  king  who  does  not  fulfil  his  duties  in  regard  to  his  people 
each  day,  undoubtedly  falls  into  the  darkest  hell. 

"  It  is  related  that  formerly  a  monarch  named  Nriga  reigned, 
who  was  illustrious,  truthful,  pure-hearted  and  devoted  to  the 
brahmins.  Once  at  the  time  of  a  sacred  pilgrimage  to  Pushkara, 
that  monarch  bestowed  on  the  brahmins  hundreds  and  thousands 
of  kine  with  gilded  horns,  accompanied  by  their  calves. 

"And  it  came  about  that  one  cow  with  its  calf,  belonging  to  a 
poor  brahmin,  was  accidentally  given  away  and  he,  hungry  and 
thirsty,  searched  in  vain  here  and  there  for  that  cow  for  a  long 
time.  Finally,  having  reached  Kankhala,  he  observed  his  cow 
in  the  abode  of  a  brahmin  and,  though  in  good  health,  it  had 
grown  old.  Thereupon  that  brahmin  called  the  cow  by  name 
crying  'Shabali,  come  'and  the  beast,  hearing  him,  recognized  the 
voice  of  that  one  who  was  stricken  with  hunger  and  followed  him. 
538 


UTTARA    KANDA 

"  Then  the  ascetic,  in  whose  house  the  cow  had  been  retained} 
speedily  pursued  him  and,  reaching  that  Rishi,  addressed  him  in 
harsh  tones,  saying  '  That  cow  belongs  to  me  and  was  given  me 
by  the  foremost  of  monarchs ;  it  was  Nriga  who  bestowed  her 
on  me  as  a  gift.' 

"  Thereupon  a  great  quarrel  ensued  between  those  two  learned 
brahmins,  and  wrangling,  they  both  approached  the  one  who  had 
given  away  that  cow,  but  though  they  waited  there  a  long  time,  they 
were  unable  to  gain  admission  to  the  palace.  Having  tarried 
there  many  days  and  nights,  they  became  greatly  enraged  and 
those  two  illustrious  ascetics,  furious  at  not  achieving  their 
purpose,  uttered  the  following  dreadful  malediction : — 

"  '  Since  thou  hast  refused  to  grant  us  audience  in  order  to 
settle  our  dispute,  do  thou  become  a  lizard  and  remain  invisible 
to  all  beings  ;  in  that  state  thou  shalt  pass  hundreds  and  thous- 
ands of  years  in  a  ditch ;  when  Vishnu,  in  human  form,  descends 
to  earth  among  the  Yadus,  whose  glory  he  will  enhance,  thou 
shalt  be  liberated  from  the  curse  !  He  shall  be  named  Vasudeva. 
When  the  Kali  Yuga  has  come,  Nara  and  Narayana  will  descend 
on  earth  to  relieve  her  of  her  burden.' 

"  Having  pronounced  this  curse  on  the  king,  the  two  brahmins 
fell  silent  and  they  both  agreed  to  bestow  the  cow,  who  had 
become  old  and  weak,  on  another  brahmin. 

"  O  Lakshmana,  King  Nriga  is  still  suffering  under  that 
dreadful  curse.  The  folly  of  not  attending  to  the  dispute  between 
contestants  is  to  be  attributed  to  the  king.  Therefore  let  all 
those  who  have  come  for  reasons  of  arbitration  be  ushered  into 
my  presence ,  though  a  king  does  not  seek  the  fruit  of  duty 
fulfilled.  Go  now  personally  and  see  if  anyone  seeks  audience 
with  me." 

CHAPTER    54 

The  End  of  the  Story  of  Nriga 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  supremely  effulgent  Rama,  the 

exceedingly  sagacious  Lakshmana,  with  joined  palms,  replied  : — 

"  O  Kakutstha,  it  was  for  a  very  trivial  fault  that  the  Twice- 

borns  struck  down  Nriga,  that  royal  Sage,  with  that  dreadful 

539 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

curse  like  unto  the  Rod  of  Yama.  O  Foremost  of  Men,  what 
did  King  Nriga  reply  to  those  enraged  ascetics  when  they 
condemned  him  to  such  suffering  ?  " 

Thus  questioned  by  Lakshmana,  Raghava  took  up  the  tale 
again,  saying : — 

"  O  Gentle  One,  hear  what  that  prince  first  did  when  he  was 
struck  down  by  the  curse.  Learning  that  the  two  Sages  had 
departed,  the  king  called  together  his  ministers,  citizens  and 
chief  priests  and,  in  the  presence  of  his  subjects,  said  : — 

"  '  Hear  me  carefully  !  Having  pronounced  a  dreadful  curse 
upon  me,  the  Rishis  Karada  and  Parvata  have,  with  the  speed  of 
the  wind,  returned  to  the  Region  of  Brahma.  Let  the  youthful 
Prince  Vasu,  here  present,  be  installed  on  the  throne  to-day. 
Let  artisans  construct  three  ditches,  where  I  shall  expiate  the 
curse  laid  upon  me  by  the  brahmins,  one  proof  against  the  rains, 
one  against  the  cold  and  a  third  against  the  heat ;  let  this 
habitation  be  made  comfortable  and  trees  laden  with  fruit  and 
bushes  covered  with  flowers  be  planted  round  about,  as  also 
shrubs  of  every  kind  to  lend  shade.  The  precincts  of  these 
ditches  should  be  pleasant  and  I  shall  pass  the  time  agreeably 
there  till  the  termination  of  my  sufferings.  Let  flowers  with  a 
sweet  fragrance  be  sown  frequently  for  half  a  league  on  all  sides ! ' 

"  Having  made  these  arrangements,  he  installed  Vasu  on  the 
throne  and  addressed  him,  saying ; — 

"  *  My  Son,  be  ever  fixed  in  thy  duty  and  rule  thy  subjects  in 
accord  with  the  laws  of  the  Kshatriyas.  Keep  before  thine  eyes 
the  curse  the  two  brahmins  pronounced  upon  me.  Do  not 
grieve  on  my  account,  O  Foremost  of  Men.  Destiny  is  just,  0 
My  son,  it  is  destiny1  that  has  plunged  me  in  this  affliction. 
What  must  happen  will  happen  ;  what  we  must  pursue  will  be 
pursued ;  what  is  to  be  attained  will  be  attained,  whether  good 
or  ill,  according  to  the  acts  of  a  previous  existence.  Do  not  grieve, 
O  My  Son.' 

"  Having  spoken  thus  to  his  son,  the  highly  illustrious  King 
Nriga  descended  into  the  constructed  ditch  in  order  to  take  up 
his  abode  there.  Having  entered  that  deep  hole  adorned  with 
precious  gems,  the  magnanimous  Nriga  suffered  the  curse  that 
the  two  brahmins  had  pronounced  on  him  in  their  anger."

The  Story  of  Nina 

"  I  have  related  the  cursing  of  Nriga  in  detail  but,  if  thou  so 
desireth,  listen  to  the  following  story  !  *' 

On  this,  Saumitri  said : — 

"  I  never  tire  of  hearing  these  marvellous  tales,  O  King !  " 

Thus  spoke  Lakshmana,  and  Rama,  the  Joy  of  the  Ikshvakus, 
began  to  recount  many  exceedingly  instructive  legends,  saying  :- 

"  There  was  once  a  king  named  Nimi,  the  twelfth  son  of  the 
magnanimous  offspring  of  the  Ikshvakus  and  he  was  full  of 
courage  and  truth.  That  highly  valorous  monarch  founded  a 
beautiful  city,  resembling  that  of  the  Gods,  in  the  vicinity  of 
Gautama's  hermitage,  and  the  name  of  that  city  was  Vaijanta ! 
It  served  as  the  residence  of  the  royal  Sage  Nimi  and,  while  he 
dwelt  in  that  vast  capital,  he  reflected  '  X  will  perform  a  great 
sacrifice  to  gratify  my  sire ! ' 

"  Having  invited  his  father,  Ikshvaku,  the  son  of  Manu,  he 
first  welcomed  Vasishtha,  the  foremost  of  Rishis ;  thereafter  the 
Rajarishi  Nimi,  the  Joy  of  Ikshvaku,  invited  Atri,  Angira  and 
also  Bhrigu,  that  treasury  of  asceticism. 

"  Meanwhile  Vasishtha  said  to  Nimi,  the  foremost  of  royal 
Sages  : — '  I  am  already  pledged  to  Indra,  therefore  wait  for  me 
till  his  sacrifice  is  completed.' 

"  Soon  afterwards,  the  great  ascetic  Gautama  undertook  the 
sacrifice1  whilst  the  mighty  Vasishtha  was  officiating  at  Indra's 
ceremony. 

"  King  Nimi,  that  foremost  of  men,  having  assembled  the 
brahmins,  celebrated  a  sacrifice  in  the  vicinity  of  his  city  on  the 
side  of  the  Himavat  Mountain,  its  term  exceeding  five  thousand 
years. 

"  Indra's  sacrifice  being  completed,  the  blessed  and  irre- 
proachable Sage  Vasishtha  returned  to  the  king  and  offered 
himself  as  officiating  priest.  Observing  that  Gautama  had,  in 
the  interval,  filled  that  office,  Vasishtha  was  transported  with

rage  and,  anxious  to  behold  the  king,  sought  out  the  monarch, 
but  that  day  he  lay  in  a  deep  sleep  and  the  fury  of  the  magnani- 
mous Vasishtha  burst  forth  anew,  so  that  he  began  to  curse  the 
king,  who  was  unaware  of  his  presence  there,  saying : — 

"  *  Since  thou  didst  choose  another  and  have  failed  to  treat 
me  with  due  respect,  O  King,  thy  body  will  be  rendered  lifeless  ! ' 

"  Thereupon  the  king  awoke  and,  hearing  the  curse  pro- 
nounced against  him,  in  a  transport  of  rage,  said  to  the  son  of 
Brahma : — 

"  '  When  I  was  unconscious  and  asleep,  thou,  beside  thyself 
with  anger,  hast  subjected  me  to  the  fire  of  thy  wrath  like  unto 
the  Rod  of  Yama !  For  this,  be  assured  thy  body  too,  O 
Brahmarishi,  shall  be  bereft  of  sensation  for  a  long  time.' 

"  Thus  both  dominated  by  anger,  the  foremost  of  kings  and 
the  chief  of  the  ascetics,  mutually  cursed  one  another  and  they, 
whose  powers  were  equal  to  the  Gods,  were  both  instantly 
deprived  of  their  bodies."

The  Cursing  of  the  Nymph  Urvaski 

Having  heard  this  story,  Lakshmana,  the  Slayer  of  His  Foes, 
with  joined  palms,  addressed  the  effulgent  Rama,  saying : — 

"  O  Kakutstha,  how  did  that  Twice-born  One,  worshipped  by 
the  Celestials,  and  the  king,  having  cast  off  their  bodies,  regain 
them  once  more  ?  " 

Thus  questioned  by  Lakshmana,  Rama,  having  truth  for  his 
prowess,  answered : — 

"  Following  on  their  mutual  cursing,  those  two  virtuous 
Ones,  that  Sage  among  monarchs  and  the  foremost  of  ascetics, 
having  discarded  their  bodies,  lived  in  their  subtle  forms. 
Thereafter,  the  great  Rishi  Vasishtha,  desirous  of  regaining  his 
physical  shape,  sought  out  his  sire,  and  that  virtuous  Sage  in  his 
subtle  body,  paid  obeisance  to  the  feet  of  that  God  of  Gods,  the 
Grandsire,  and  addressed  him,  saying : — 

"  '  O  Lord,  through  King  Nimi's  curse,  I  am  deprived  of  my 
physical  body,  O  Lord  of  Lords,  O  Mahadeva,  I  am  merged  in

air !  Those  deprived  of  a  body  suffer  great  misfortune ;  many 
righteous  deeds  may  not  be  performed  without  a  body,  O  Lord, 
by  thy  favour  grant  me  another  form  ! ' 

"  Then  Brahma  Swyambhu,  whose  powers  are  immeasurable, 
said  to  him  :— 

" '  Do  thou  enter  the  vital  seed  of  Mitra  and  Varuna,  O  Thou 
illustrious  One  !  Thou  shalt  then  be  born  without  a  mother,  O 
Foremost  of  the  Twice-born,  and,  endowed  with  great  virtue, 
shalt  regain  thy  state.' 

"  Thus  spoke  the  divine  Grandsire,  and  Vasishtha,  circum- 
ambulating him,  instantly  left  for  Varuna's  abode.  At  that  time, 
Mitra,  being  worshipped  by  the  foremost  of  the  Celestials  was 
reigning  over  Varuna's  kingdom  and  the  chief  Apsara,  Urvashi, 
came  there  by  chance  in  company  with  her  friends. 

"  Beholding  the  lovely  Urvashi  sporting  in  the  waters,  Varuna 
was  seized  with  extreme  delight  and  desired  to  unite  himself 
with  that  nymph,  whose  eyes  are  as  large  as  lotus  petals  and  whose 
face  was  as  radiant  as  the  moon,  but  she,  with  joined  palms, 
answered  him  saying : — 

"  '  Mitra  has  already  invited  me  for  this  purpose,  O  Chief  of 
the  Gods !  * 

"  Then  Varuna,  being  stricken  with  desire,  said  : — *  Since 
thou  dost  not  wish  to  be  united  with  me,  I  shall  loose  my  vital 
seed  in  the  vessel  created  by  Brahma,  O  Thou  of  lovely  hips  and 
beautiful  complexion,  thus  shall  my  desire  be  satisfied.' 

"  Hearing  this  amiable  speech,  Urvashi  was  highly  gratified 
and  said  to  him  : — 

"  *  Be  it  so,  for  my  mind  is  fixed  on  thee,  though  my  body 
belongs  to  Mitra,  O  Lord  ! ' 

"At  these  words  of  Urvashi,  Varuna  discharged  bis  powerful 
vital  seed,  that  shone  like  fire,  into  the  vessel.  Then  the  divine 
Urvashi  immediately  sought  out  Mitra  and  he,  in  the  height  of 
anger,  said  to  her  :— 

" '  Why  didst  thou  desert  me,  who  first  chose  thee  ?  For  what 
reason  hast  thou  taken  another,  O  Thou  without  moral  sense  ? 
For  this  misdeed,  I  condemn  thee  to  live  in  the  world  of  men  for 
a  time ;  thou  shalt  be  united  with  the  son  of  Budha,  the  royal 
Sage  Pururavas,  who  rules  over  Kashi !  Go  to  him,  O  Sinful 
One!'

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  Then  Urvashi,  under  the  influence  of  that  curse,  went  to 
Pratisthana  to  Pururavas,  the  beloved  son  of  Budha,  and  she 
bore  him  a  lovely  child,  Ayu,  who  was  full  of  valour  and  became 
the  father  of  Nahusha,  the  equal  of  Indra  in  glory,  and  when  the 
Lord  of  the  Celestials  loosed  his  thunderbolt  on  Vritra  and 
suffered  eclipse,1  Nahusha  reigned  in  his  stead  for  thousands  of 
years. 

"  In  consequence  of  this  curse,  Urvashi,  of  charming  teeth, 
beautiful  eyes  and  graceful  brows,  descended  on  earth  where  she 
passed  many  years  and,  the  period  of  the  curse  having  expired, 
she  returned  to  the  Region  of  Indra." 


chapter    57 

The  End  of  the  Story  of  Vasishtha  and  Ninri 

Hearing  that  wonderful  and  divine  theme,  Lakshmana,  highly 
delighted,  said  to  Raghava  : — 

"  O  Kakutstha,  how  did  that  Twice-born  One  and  the  king, 
adored  by  the  Gods,  who  had  been  deprived  of  their  physical 
bodies  regain  them  again  ?  " 

Thus  questioned,  Rama,  that  true  hero  began  to  relate  the 
history  of  the  magnanimous  Vasishtha,  saying : — 

"  O  Prince  of  the  Raghus,  from  that  vessel  in  which  the  two 
mighty  Gods  had  emptied  their  vital  seed,  two  Sages  were  born, 
who  were  the  foremost  of  Rishis.  First  Agastya  appeared,  that 
blessed  ascetic,  and  he  said  to  Mitra,  '  I  am  not  thy  son  '  and 
went  away.  O  Lakshmana,  the  seed  of  Mitra  formerly  received 
by  Urvashi,  was  to  be  found  in  the  same  vessel  as  that  of  Varuna's 

"After  a  time  Vasishtha  was  born  in  his  turn,  he  who  is 
worshipped  by  the  Celestials,  he  is  a  God  to  the  Ikshvakus  and 
the  mighty  and  highly  effulgent  Iksbvaku  chose  the  irreproach- 
able Vasishtha  as  his  family  priest  for  the  good  of  our  race,  O  My 
Friend !  I  have  thus  described  to  thee  how  the  magnanimous 
Vasishtha,  who  was  previously  bodiless,  was  re-born,  now  hear 
of  the  history  of  Nimi .

UTTARA    KANDA 

"  Beholding  the  king  deprived  of  his  body,  all  the  sagacious 
Rishis  assisted  him  by  the  celebration  of  a  sacrifice  and  the 
foremost  of  the  Twice-born  preserved  the  body  of  that  first  of 
monarchs  by  means  of  unguents,  cloths  and  herbs  with  the  help 
of  the  citizens  and  servants.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  sacrifice, 
Bhrigu  said  to  Nimi, '  I  shall  restore  thee  to  life,  O  King,  I  am 
gratified  with  thee.' 

"  Thereafter  the  Gods  in  their  delight  said  to  him :— *  Choose 
a  boon,  O  Royal  Sage,  where  shall  thy  consciousness  be  set  ?  ' 
"  Thus  spoke  the  Gods  and  Nimi's  spirit  answered : — 
"  '  I  wish  to  live  in  the  eyes  of  all  beings,  O  Illustrious  Gods  !  * 
"  '  So  be  it ',  said  the  Celestials, '  Thou  shalt  dwell  in  the  eyes 
of  all  beings  in  the  form  of  air.    By  thy  grace,  O  Lord  of  the 
Earth,  their  eyes  shall  close  again  and  again  for  rest  when  thou 
dost  move  about  in  the  form  of  air.' 

"  Having  spoken  thus,  the  Gods  returned  to  their  own  region 
and  the  magnanimous  Rishis  bore  away  Nimi's  body  to  the 
sacrificial  ground  and  began  to  rub  it  with  great  energy  to  the 
accompaniment  of  sacred  formulas.  And  from  the  Arani,1  thus 
violently  agitated,  a  great  and  highly  ascetic  Being  arose  and,  on 
account  of  him  being  born  from  an  inanimate  body,  he  was 
called  Mithi,  the  King  of  Videha,  and  through  this  birth,  he 
became  the  ancient  Janaka.1  It  was  from  that  Being  of  severe 
penances,  who  was  called  Mithi,  that  the  race  of  Mithila 
originated.  O  Friend,  I  have  told  thee  all  without  omitting  any- 
thing concerning  the  curse  and  of  the  wonderful  birth  of  that 
royal  Sage  and  the  foremost  of  kings."

Shukra  curses  Yayati 

Thus  spoke  Rama,  and  Lakshmana,  the  Slayer  of  His  Foes,  said 
to  his  mighty  brother  who  was  blazing  with  effulgence : — 
"  O  Lion  among  Monarchs,  this  ancient  history  of  the  King

given  to  the  father  or  begetter  of  that  great  Race. 

545 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

of  Vidcha  and  the  Sage  Vasishtha  is  astonishing  and  wonderful, 
but  why  was  King  Nimi,  a  warrior  full  of  valour,  who  had  re- 
ceived initiation,  unable  to  forgive  the  Rishi  Vasishtha  ?  " 

Thus  questioned  by  Lakshmana,  who  was  conversant  with  the 
Shastras,  Rama,  the  foremost  of  warriors,  answered  his  illus- 
trious brother,  saying : — 

"  O  Valiant  One,  forgiveness  is  not  always  shown  by  men  !  O 
Saumitri,  hear  with  what  resignation  King  Yayati  bore  the 
injuries  done  to  him  ! 

"  King  Yayati,  the  prosperity  of  his  people,  was  the  son  of 
Nahusha — he  had  two  wives,  whose  beauty  was  unequalled  on 
earth.  One  was  his  favourite,  Sharmishtha,  born  of  Diti  and  the 
Daitya  Vrashparvan,  the  other  consort  of  Yayati  was  the  daughter 
of  Shukacharya  and  called  Devayani,  who  was  not  beloved  of  her 
husband. 

"  Two  sons  of  great  beauty  and  amiability  were  born  to  them, 
Sharmishtha  begot  Puru  and  Devayani,  Yadu.  Furu  was  the 
favourite  of  his  sire  on  account  of  his  good  qualities  and  also 
because  of  his  mother,  whereupon  Yadu,  much  distressed,  said 
to  Devayani  : — 

"  *  Thou,  who  art  born  in  the  family  of  the  divine  son  of 
Bhrigu  of  imperishable  exploits,  art  exposed  to  misery  and 
contempt.  It  is  intolerable,  let  us  both  enter  the  fire,  O  Queen, 
and  let  the  King  amuse  himself  for  innumerable  nights  with  the 
daughter  of  the  Daitya.  Or,  if  thou  art  able  to  endure  it,  then 
allow  me  to  go  my  way.  Do  thou  suffer  this  for  I  shall  not  brook 
it  and  have  resolved  to  put  an  end  to  my  life.' 

"At  these  words  from  her  son,  who  was  weeping,  Devayani, 
overcome  by  grief,  highly  indignant,  called  her  Sire  to  mind 
and  being  thought  upon,  Bhargava  instantly  appeared  before  his 
daughter  and,  beholding  her  perturbed  and  beside  herself,  he 
enquired  of  her  saying : — 

"  '  O  Child,  what  is  the  matter  ?  *  Then  Bhargava,  his  heart 
wrung,  questioned  her  again  and  again,  whereupon  Devayani, 
enraged,  answered  her  father,  saying : — 

"  '  I  shall  enter  the  fire  or  drink  poison  or  cast  myself  in  the 

waters  for  I  will  not  continue  living.    Thou  dost  not  know  to 

what  misery  and  contempt  I  am  subject!    When  a  tree  is 

neglected,  those  who  live  thereon  suffer.    The  king  disregards 

546 


UTTARA    KANDA 

me  and  treats  me  with  disdain,  therefore  thou  too  art  dis- 
regarded ! ' 

"At  these  words,  which  filled  him  with  fury,  the  descendant 
of  Bhrigu  began  to  curse  the  son  of  Nahusha,  saying : — 

"  '  O  Nahusha,  since  in  the  wickedness  of  thy  heart,  thou  hast 
looked  upon  me  with  contempt,  old  age  shall  come  upon  thee 
and  thou  shalt  become  senile.' 

"  Having  spoken  thus  and  comforted  his  daughter,  the 
descendant  of  Bhrigu,  that  highly  illustrious  Brahmarishi 
returned  to  his  own  abode. 

"  Having  solaced  his  daughter,  Devayani,  and  pronounced 
that  curse  on  the  king,  the  foremost  of  the  Twice-born,  Shukra, 
radiant  as  the  sun,  departed." 


CHAPTER    59 

Puru  takes  the  place  of  his  Father  cursed  by  Shukra 

"At  these  words  of  the  enraged  Shukra,1  the  unfortunate 
Yayati,  overtaken  by  old  age,  said  to  Yadu  : — 

"  *  O  Yadu,  My  Son,  Thou  art  conversant  with  dharma,  do 
thou  take  mine  old  age  upon  thyself  and  give  me  back  my  youth 
so  that  I  may  continue  to  give  myself  up  to  various  enjoyments. 
O  Foremost  of  Men,  I  am  not  yet  sated  with  pleasures ;  once  I 
am  satisfied,  I  will  resume  my  senility.' 

"  Hearing  these  words,  Yadu  answered  that  foremost  of 
monarchs,  saying : — 

" '  Thou  hast  excluded  me  from  all  matters,  O  King,  and 
deprived  me  of  thy  proximity,  let  Puru,  who  feasts  with  thee, 
take  this  upon  himself ! ' 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  Yadu,  the  king  addressed  Puru, 
saying: — 

" '  O  Hero,  do  thou  take  mine  old  age  upon  thee.' 

"  On  this,  Puru,  with  joined  palms,  cried  out  :— 

" '  What  good  fortune  is  mine !  Do  thou  favour  me,  I  am  at 
thy  command  I ' 

1  Also  called  Bhargava. 

547 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  This  response  from  Puru  filled  Nahusha  with  exceeding  joy 
and,  seeing  himself  freed  from  senility,  he  experienced  an 
unequalled  satisfaction.  Thereupon,  regaining  his  youth,  he 
performed  thousands  of  sacrifices  and  ruled  the  earth  for 
innumerable  years.    After  a  long  time,  the  king  said  to  Puru  : — 

"  '  Give  me  back  mine  old  age,  my  Son,  that  I  deposited  with 
thee !  I  placed  this  decrepitude  upon  thee  and  that  is  why  I  now 
reclaim  it.  Fear  not,  I  am  pleased  with  thy  submission  to  my 
will  and  shall  install  thee  as  king  in  token  of  my  satisfaction.' 

"  Having  spoken  thus  to  his  son,  Puru,  King  Yayati,  born  of 
Nahusha,  addressed  the  son  of  Devayani  harshly,  saying : — 

"  '  Thou  art  an  intractable  Rakshasa  born  to  me  as  a  warrior, 
O  Thou  who  dost  disregard  my  behests  !  Thou  shalt  never  be 
king !  Since  thou  hast  set  me  at  nought,  who  am  thy  sire  and  thy 
spiritual  director,  thou  shalt  beget  terrible  Rakshasas  and 
Yatudhanas !  Assuredly,  O  Thou  of  perverse  soul,  thy  race 
shall  not  intermingle  with  the  issue  of  the  lunar  race  and  will 
resemble  thee  in  conduct.' 

"  Having  spoken  thus  for  the  good  of  his  realm,  that  royal 
Sage  invested  Puru  with  the  supreme  dignity  and  himself 
withdrew  to  the  forest. 

"After  a  long  time,  when  the  hour  fixed  had  struck,  he  went 
to  the  Celestial  Abode.  Thereafter  Puru  ruled  the  empire  with 
great  equity  and  glory  in  the  City  of  Pratishthana  in  the  kingdom 
of  Kashi. 

"  Yadu  however  begot  thousands  of  Yatudhanas  in  the  in- 
accessible City  of  Durga.  In  this  wise,  Yayati  endured  Shukra's 
curse  in  accord  with  the  traditions  of  the  Kshatriyas  but  Niroi 
never  exercised  forgiveness. 

"  I  have  related  everything  to  thee,  let  us  follow  the  example 
of  those  who  accept  all,  so  that  we  do  not  tall  like  Nriga." 

As  Rama,  whose  face  resembled  the  moon,  was  speaking  thus, 
the  heavens  were  spangled  with  stars  and  the  east  became  a 
roseate  golden  colour  as  if  she  had  donned  a  robe  covered  with 
the  pollen  of  flowers.

FIRST    OF    THE    INTERPOLATED    CHAPTERS 
3rd    SERIES 

In  the  dear  light  of  dawn,  the  lotus-eyed  Rama  performed  the 
morning  rites  and  took  his  seat  in  the  council  chamber  on  the 
royal  throne  in  the  company  of  the  brahmins  and  citizens 
engaged  in  affairs  of  state.  And  the  Priest  Vasishtha  with  the 
Sage  Kashyapa  and  others  well  versed  in  the  rules  of  government, 
ministers  conversant  with  the  law,  scriptures  and  ethics  were  of 
the  assembly,  which  resembled  Indra's  Hall  of  Justice  or  Yama's 
or  Kuvera's. 

Then  Rama  said  to  Lakshmana,  who  was  endowed  with 
auspicious  marks : — 

"  O  Saumitri,  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  do  thou  go  out  to  the 
city  gate  and  summon  those  who  have  come  here  as  petitioners." 

Thereupon,  according  to  Rama's  command,  Lakshmana, 
endowed  with  auspicious  marks,  went  to  the  gate  and  called 
upon  those  who  had  come  as  complainants,  but  no  one  presented 
himself,  for,  under  the  rule  of  Ramachandra,  there  was  neither 
poverty  nor  disease  and  the  earth  was  filled  with  grain  and 
herbs.  Neither  children  nor  the  young  nor  those  of  middle 
age  met  with  death,  the  kingdom  was  ruled  with  equity  and  there 
was  no  adversity.  Thus  during  Rama's  administration  none 
was  to  be  seen  who  was  in  need  of  justice. 

Then  Lakshmana,  with  joined  palms,  said  to  Rama  : — "  None 
has  come  as  complainant,"  whereupon  Rama,  with  a  delighted 
heart,  answered : — 

"  Do  thou  go  once  more,  O  Saumitri,  and  see  if  any  presents 
himself!  Under  royal  decree,  unrighteousness  must  not 
prevail.  Though  laws  inaugurated  by  me  protect  my  subjects 
from  harm,  like  the  arrows  I  discharge,  yet,  O  Long-armed  One, 
do  thou  engage  thyself  in  vigilance  on  their  behalf." 

Thus  addressed,  Lakshmana  went  forth  from  the  palace  and 
observed  a  dog  sitting  at  the  gate.  Fixing  its  gaze  steadfastly 
upon  him,  that  dog  was  howling  unceasingly  and  the  valiant 
Lakshmana,  beholding  it  in  that  plight,  said  : — 

2N  549 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  0  Fortunate  One,  what  has  brought  thee  hither,  speak 
without  fear  ?  " 

Hearing  the  words  of  Lakshmana,  the  dog  replied  : — 

"  I  wish  to  communicate  something  to  Rama  of  imperishable 
exploits,  who  is  the  refuge  of  all  beings  and  who  confers  fearless- 
ness on  all." 

Hearing  the  dog's  words,  Lakshmana  entered  the  beautiful 
palace  to  inform  Rama  and,  having  reported  the  matter  to 
Ramachandra,  he  went  out  and  said  to  the  dog ; — 

"  If  thou  hast  anything  true  to  say  then  come  and  inform  the 
king  I  " 

Hearing  the  words  of  Lakshmana,  the  dog  said  : — 

"  Since  we  are  vilely  born,  we  may  not  enter  the  temple  of  a 
God,  the  palace  of  a  king  or  the  abode  of  a  brahmin,  nor  may  we 
go  where  there  is  fire,  Indra,  the  sun  or  the  wind  !  The  king  is 
the  personification  of  virtue ;  Shri  Ramachandra  is  truthful, 
well  versed  in  the  science  of  warfare  and  is  ever  engaged  in  the 
welfare  of  all  beings  ;  he  is  perfectly  cognisant  of  the  time  and 
place  to  exercise  the  six  qualities,  a  master  of  ethics,  omniscient, 
all-seeing  and  is  the  delight  of  his  subjects.  He  is  the  moon,  the 
sun,  Agni,  Yama,  Indra,  Kuvera  and  Varuna.  O  Saumitri,  do 
thou  go  and  communicate  to  the  king,  the  protector  of  his 
subjects,  that  without  his  permission  I  may  not  enter." 

Thereupon  the  highly  effulgent  and  noble-minded  Lakshmana 
went  into  the  palace  and  said  to  Rama  : — 

"  O  Long-armed  One,  the  enhancer  of  Kaushalya's  joy,  I  have 
carried  out  thy  behests  and  shall  relate  everything  to  thee,  hear 
me  !  As  a  petitioner,  a  dog  is  at  the  gate  awaiting  thy  pleasure." 

Then  Rama  answered,  saying : — 

"  Whosoever  it  may  be,  speedily  bring  him  in  !  " 


SECOND    OP    THE    INTERPOLATED    CHAPTERS

Hearing  the  words  of  Rama,  the  sagacious  Lakshmana  immedi- 
ately sent  for  the  dog  who  stood  before  Rama,  and  he,  beholding 
it,  said : —

UTTARA    KANDA 

"  Come,  communicate  what  thou  hast  to  say  without 
fear ! " 

Thereupon  the  dog,  whose  skull  was  gashed,  said  : — 

"  The  king  is  the  protector  of  animals  and  their  lord  !  He  is 
awake  when  others  sleep ;  by  administering  the  law,  the  king 
protects  dharma ;  without  his  support,  his  people  perish.  The 
king  is  the  lord,  the  king  is  the  father  of  all  the  world  !  He  is 
Kala,1  He  is  Yuga,2  He  is  the  creation  which  comprises  all 
animate  and  inanimate  beings ;  He  is  dharma  because  He 
supports  all,  for  it  is  dharma  that  sustains  the  worlds,  by  dharma 
the  Three  Worlds  are  upheld ;  it  is  dharma  that  restrains  the 
wicked  ;  it  is  for  this  he  is  called  Dharana  ;3  dharma  is  greater 
than  all  and  confers  benefits  after  the  death  of  the  body ; 
nought  is  superior  to  dharma  in  the  world.  O  King,  charity, 
compassion,  reverence  for  the  wise  and  absence  of  guile  are  the 
chief  virtues  that  constitute  dharma.  They  who  follow  dharma 
are  happy  in  this  life  and  in  the  next.  O  Raghava,  O  Thou  of 
firm  vows,  thou  art  the  authority  of  authorities.  Thou  art  well 
known  for  such  conduct  as  is  followed  by  the  pious.  Thou  art 
an  ocean  of  good  qualities  and  the  abode  of  righteousness.  O 
Foremost  of  Kings,  if  in  mine  ignorance  I  have  said  many 
things  to  thee,  with  bowed  head  I  crave  thy  forgiveness  ;  be  not 
angry  with  me." 

Hearing  these  words  from  the  dog,  that  were  full  of  wisdom, 
Rama  said : — 

"  What  snail  I  do  for  thee,  speak  without  fear  !  " 

Then  the  dog  answered  : — 

"  O  King,  it  is  by  dharma  that  a  king  rules,  it  is  by  dharma  that 
a  king  protects  his  subjects  and  becomes  a  refuge,  delivering  men 
from  fear.  Bearing  this  in  mind,  O  Rama,  do  thou  bear  me. 
There  is  a  brahmin  named  Sarvatha-siddha  who  lives  on  alms 
and  who  has  all  his  desires  satisfied.  Through  no  fault  of  mine 
he  has  inflicted  a  wound  on  my  head.*' 

Hearing  these  words,  Rama  sent  forth  a  messenger  who 
brought  Sarvartha-siddha  there,  and  he,  beholding  Rama  in  the 
assembly  of  those  effulgent  and  leading  Sages,  said  : — 

1  Kala— Time. 

1  Yuga— The  World  Cycle. 

J  Dharana — The  Supporter,  t'pholder.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  O  Sinless  King,  for  what  purpose  hast  thou  sent  for  me  ?  " 
Then  the  king  answered,  saying  : — 

"  O  Brahmin,  thou  hast  injured  this  dog.  What  offence  did 
it  commit  that  thou  didst  strike  it  severely  with  thy  staff? 
Anger  is  a  mortal  foe ;  anger  is  a  sweet-spoken  enemy  in  the 
garb  of  a  friend ;  anger  is  the  first  of  passions  and  like  unto  a 
sharp  sword ;  anger  bears  away  the  essence  of  good  ;  it  carries 
away  all  that  is  acquired  by  asceticism ;  sacrifices,  gifts  and 
charity  are  all  destroyed  by  anger,  therefore  it  is  proper  to 
banish  anger  by  every  means.  Passion  runs  wild  on  all  sides 
like  exceedingly  wicked  steeds.  Satiated  with  all  the  objects  of 
enjoyment,  it  is  better  to  govern  these  appetites  with  patience. 
By  mind,  speech  and  sight,  a  man  should  engage  himself  in  the 
well-being  of  others.  He  should  give  up  aversion  and  injure  no 
one.  The  harm  that  an  uncontrolled  mind  can  accomplish  is 
beyond  the  range  of  a  sharp  sword  or  a  serpent  that  has  been 
trodden  underfoot  or  a  foe  who  has  been  provoked.  Even  the 
nature  of  one  who  has  learnt  humility  cannot  always  be  trusted ; 
a  study  of  the  Scriptures  does  not  alter  the  innate  character  of  a 
man,  he  who  conceals  his  nature,  will  reveal  his  true  self  at  a 
given  moment." 

Rama  of  imperishable  exploits,  having  spoken  thus,  Sarvatha  ■- 
siddha,  the  foremost  of  the  Twice-born,  said  : — 

"  O  King,  wandering  about  the  whole  day  in  search  of  alms, 
I  became  angry  and  struck  the  dog.  It  was  seated  in  the  centre 
of  a  narrow  street  and  I  requested  it  to  move  away ;  thereupon 
moving  with  reluctance,  it  stood  by  the  roadside.  O  Descendant 
of  Raghu,  at  that  time  I  was  overcome  with  hunger  and  struck 
it  for  its  perverse  conduct.  I  am  guilty,  O  King,  do  thou  punish 
me,  O  Lord  of  Monarchs,  do  thou  administer  correction  and  I 
shall  be  released  from  the  fear  of  hell." 

Then  Rama  enquired  of  all  his  ministers,  saying : — 

"  What  shall  be  done  now  ?  What  punishment  should  be 
inflicted  on  him  ?  By  administrating  justice  in  accord  with  the 
crime,  our  subjects  are  protected." 

Thereupon  Bhrigu,  Angiras,  Kutsa,  Vasishtha,  Kashyapa  and 

the  other  Rishis,  ministers,  leading  merchants   and   Sages 

conversant  with  the  Shastras,  who  were  present  there,  said,  "A 

brahmin  is  exempt  from  punishment,"  and  the  Sages,  conversant 

552 


UTTARA    KANDA 

with  the  law,  having  spoken  thus,  those  ascetics  addressed  Rama, 
saying : — 

"  O  Raghava,  a  king  is  the  ruler  of  all  and  thou  above  all,  for 
thou  art  the  Chastiser  of  the  Three  Worlds,  the  Eternal  Vishnu." 

They,  having  spoken  thus,  the  dog  said  : — 

"  Thou  didst  solemnly  enquire  '  What  shall  I  do  for  thee  ?  ' 
therefore  if  thou  art  pleased  with  me  and  dost  wish  to  bestow  a 
favour  on  me,  do  thou  appoint  this  brahmin  to  be  head  of  the 
holy  assembly  of  the  Kalanjava  Monastery." 

Thereupon  the  king  instantly  sanctioned  the  appointment,  and 
the  brahmin,  honoured  and  gratified,  mounted  on  an  elephant, 
proceeded  to  occupy  his  new  and  dignified  status. 

At  this  Rama's  counsellors  were  astonished  and  said  : — 

"  O  Thou  of  great  effulgence,  this  brahmin  has  not  been 
punished,  rather  hast  thou  favoured  him  with  a  boon  !  " 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  ministers,  Rama  said  : — "  You  do 
not  know  the  secret  of  the  matter,  the  dog  knows  it  well ! " 
Thereafter,  questioned  by  Rama,  the  dog  said : — 

"  O  King,  I  was  formerly  the  head  of  the  assembly  of  Kalan- 
java and  after  worshipping  the  Gods,  feeding  the  brahmins  and 
feasting  the  servants,  male  and  female,  I  used  to  take  my  food. 
I  duly  administered  all  things  and  my  mind  was  untouched  by 
sin.  I  protected  the  articles  belonging  to  the  tutelary  Deities 
carefully,  cultivated  virtue,  followed  dharma  and  engaged  in  the 
welfare  of  all  beings.  In  spite  of  this,  I  have  fallen  into  this 
wretched  state.  O  Raghava,  this  brahmin  is  given  to  anger  and 
impious,  he  injures  others  and  is  harsh  and  cruel,  he  will  dis- 
honour seven  generations  of  his  race.  He  will  by  no  means  be 
able  to  discharge  the  duties  of  the  head  of  an  assembly. 

"  He  who  wishes  to  see  his  children,  friends  and  beasts  fell 
into  hell,  is  made  chief  of  the  Gods,  cows  and  brahmins  !  O 
Raghava,  he  perishes  who  deprives  the  brahmins,  women  or 
children  of  their  legitimate  possessions;  one  who  misappro- 
priates the  offerings  of  the  brahmins  or  the  Gods,  goes  to  the 
lowest  hell."* 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  dog,  the  eyes  of  Rama  opened  wide 

*  This  story  seems  to  imply  that  if  a  man  is  appointed  to  a  position 
of  authority  and  (Joes  not  discharge  his  responsibilities  faithfully,  he  is  in 
grave  danger  in  future  incarnations. 

553 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

in  astonishment.    Thereafter  the  dog  departed  from  whence  it 
had  come. 

In  its  former  birth  it  had  been  high-minded  but  was  born  in  a 
degraded  state  in  that  existence.  Repairing  to  the  holy  City  of 
Kashi,  that  dog,  desiring  to  leave  its  body  in  a  sacred  spot, 
thereafter  undertook  a  waterless  fast. 


THIRD    OF    THE    INTERPOLATED    CHAPTERS 
3rd    SERIES 

For  a  long  time  a  vulture  and  an  owl  dwelt  near  the  City  of 
Ayodhya  in  a  forest  on  a  mountain,  that  was  intersected  by  many 
streams,  where  cuckoos  called  and  which  abounded  in  lions, 
tigers  and  birds  of  every  kind. 

One  day,  the  wicked  vulture  alleging  that  the  owl's  nest  was 
his,  began  to  quarrel  with  him,  whereupon  both  said  : — 

"  Let  us  seek  out  the  lotus-eyed  Rama,  who  is  the  king  of  the 
people  and  let  him  decide  to  whom  the  nest  belongs." 

Having  thus  agreed,  the  vulture  and  the  owl,  wrangling  with 
one  another,  wrought  up  with  ire,  came  before  Rama  and 
touched  his  feet.  Beholding  that  Lord  of  Men,  the  vulture 
said : — 

"  O  Preserver  of  humanity,  thou  art  the  foremost  of  the  Devas 
and  Asuras,  O  Resplendent  One,  in  hearing  and  intelligence  thou 
art  superior  to  Brihaspati  and  Shukracharya.  Thou  art  con- 
versant with  the  good  and  evil  karma  of  all  creatures.  In 
beauty  thou  resemblest  the  moon,  in  splendour  the  sun,  in  glory 
the  Himalaya,  in  profundity  the  ocean,  in  prowess  the  Grandsire, 
in  forbearance  the  earth,  in  speed  the  wind;  thou  art  the 
Spiritual  Preceptor  of  all  animate  and  inanimate  beings  and  art 
endowed  with  every  kind  of  wealth ;  thou  art  illustrious, 
forgiving,  invincible,  victorious  and  master  of  all  the  scriptures 
and  laws.  O  Foremost  of  Men,  hear  my  plea  !  O  Lord  of 
Raghu,  I  had  built  a  nest  for  myself  and  this  owl  is  now  occupy- 
ing it  as  his  own,  therefore,  O  King,  do  thou  protect  me !  " 

The  vulture,  having  said  this,  the  owl  spoke,  saying : — 

"  True  it  is  that  in  a  king,  there  is  to  be  found  a  portion  of  the 

554 


UTTARA    KANDA 

moon,  of  Indra,  the  sun,  Kuvera  and  Yama  but  there  is  also  a 
measure  of  man  in  him.  Thou,  however,  art  the  all-pervasive 
Narayana  Himself,  Thou,  impelled  by  thine  own  Self  dost 
judge  all  creatures  impartially,  yet  a  certain  gentleness  is  mani- 
fest in  thee  and  therefore  people  say  thou  art  endowed  with  a 
portion  of  the  moon.  O  Lord,  by  anger,  punishment  and  re- 
ward, thou  dost  remove  the  sins  and  dangers  of  thy  subjects ;  it 
is  thine  to  give  and  withdraw,  thou  art  the  dispenser,  destroyer 
and  protector  and  art  as  Indra  to  us.  In  energy  thou  art  as  fire, 
irresistible  to  all  creatures  and,  since  thou  dost  spread  thy  lustre 
on  all  beings,  thou  art  like  the  sun  !  Thou  resembles!  the  Lord 
of  Wealth  and  art  even  superior  to  him,  for  prosperity  resides  in 
thee.  Thou  lookest  on  all  creatures  whether  animate  or  inani- 
mate with  the  same  eye,  O  Raghava,  and  dost  regard  foe  and 
friend  alike,  duly  protecting  thy  subjects.  O  Raghava,  those  who 
have  incurred  thine  anger  are  already  slain,  therefore  thou  art 
praised  as  Yama.  O  Foremost  of  Kings,  since,  in  human  form, 
thou  art  merciful  and  beneficent,  people  sing  thy  glory,  thou 
who  art  intent  on  not  harming  men.  The  king  is  the  strength 
of  die  weak  and  helpless,  the  eye  of  the  blind  and  the  refuge  of 
those  who  seek  shelter  in  him.  Thou  art  also  our  Lord,  therefore 
hear  our  plea !  O  King,  entering  into  my  nest,  this  vulture  is 
oppressing  me ;  thou  alone,  O  Foremost  of  Men,  art  the  divine 
chastiser  of  creatures  !  " 

Hearing  these  words,  Rama  called  for  his  ministers  with  those 
of  King  Dasaratha,  Vrishti,  Jayanta,  Vijaya,  Siddhartha, 
Rashtravarddhana,  Ashoka,  Dharmapala  and  the  highly  powerful 
Sumantra  and  others,  who  were  well  versed  in  the  law,  high- 
minded  and  conversant  with  the  Shastras,  intelligent,  nobly  born 
and  skilled  in  counsel. 

Thereafter  summoning  both,  Rama,  descending  from  his 
throne,  enquired  of  the  vulture : — "  How  long  has  this  nest  been 
made  ?   Tell  me  if  thou  dost  remember  it !  " 

Then  the  vulture  replied  : — "  From  the  time  men  were  first 
born  on  earth  and  spread  over  the  four  quarters  of  the  globe,  I 
have  been  living  in  this  nest." 

Thereupon  the  owl  said : — 

"At  the  time  when  trees  first  covered  the  earth,  this  nest  of 
mine  was  constructed." 

555 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Hearing  these  words,  Rama  said  to  his  counsellors  : — 
"  That  assembly  is  not  an  assembly  where  there  are  no  wise 
and  elderly  men,  nor  those  who  do  not  dwell  on  righteous  topics. 
That  religion  is  no  religion  where  truth  is  not  to  be  found  and 
that  truth  is  no  truth  where  there  is  guile.    Those  counsellors 
are  liars,  who  remain  silent  when  tbey  are  well  informed  in  any 
matter.    He  who  does  not  speak  either  on  account  of  passion, 
fear  or  anger,  binds  himself  with  a  thousand  nooses  of  Varuna 
and,  at  the  expiration  of  a  full  year,  is  only  released  from  a  single 
sin." 
Hearing  these  words,  the  ministers  said  to  Rama  :— 
"O  Thou  of  great  intellect,  what  the  owl  has  said  is  true,  the 
vulture  has  spoken  falsely.    Thou  art  proof  of  this,  O  Great 
King,  since  the  king  is  the  final  refuge  of  all,  the  root  of  the 
people  and  eternal  dharma  itself.    Those  punished  by  the  king 
do  not  fall  into  a  lower  state,  they  are  saved  from  hell  and  expand 
in  virtue." 
Hearing  these  words  of  the  ministers,  Rama  said  : — 
"  Hear  what  is  related  in  the  Puranas  !    Formerly  the  sun, 
moon  and  firmament  with  its  stars,  the  earth  with  its  mountains 
and  forests,  the  Three  Worlds  with  all  that  moves  and  does  not 
move  were  merged  in  the  waters  of  the  great  ocean. 

"At  that  time,  Narayana  existed  as  a  second  Sumeru  and,  in 
his  belly,  lay  the  earth  with  Lakshmi.  Having  destroyed  the 
creation  and  entered  the  waters,  the  highly  effulgent  Vishnu, 
identical  with  the  souls  of  creatures,  lay  asleep  there  for  many 
long  years.  Beholding  Vishnu  asleep  after  the  destruction  of  the 
worlds  and,  knowing  all  the  entries  to  be  obstructed,  the  great 
Brahma  entered  his  belly.  Thereupon  a  golden  lotus  sprang  from 
Vishnu's  navel,  and  that  great  Lord,  the  Creator,  Brahma,  rose 
therefrom  and  engaged  in  severe  penances  for  the  purpose  of 
creating  the  earth,  air,  mountains,  trees,  men,  reptiles  and  all 
other  life-forms  from  the  womb  or  egg. 

"  Thereafter,  from  the  wax  in  the  ears  of  Narayana,  two 
valiant  and  dreadful  Daityas,  Madhu  and  Kaitabha  were  born. 
Beholding  the  Grandsire,  they  were  gready  enraged  and  rushed 
upon  him,  whereupon  Brahma,  the  Self-born  cried  out 
loudly. 
"Awakened  by  that  sound,  Narayana  engaged  in  combat  with 
556 


UTTARA    KANDA 

Madhu  and  Kaitabha  and  slew  them  with  his  discus  and  the 
earth  was  drenched  with  their  blood.  Then,  purifying  it  once 
more,  Vishnu,  the  Preserver  of  the  World  covered  it  with  trees 
and  created  medicinal  herbs.  Thus  filled  with  the  marrow  of 
Madhu  and  Kaitabha,  the  earth  was  called  Medini.  It  is  for  this 
that  X  hold  this  abode  does  not  belong  to  the  vulture  but  to  the 
owl,  O  Counsellors,  the  owl  having  maintained  that  he  built  the 
nest  when  trees  were  first  created,  that  is,  before  men  appeared. 
This  vicious  vulture  should  therefore  be  punished,  for  this  evil- 
minded  one,  having  robbed  another  of  its  nest,  is  now  oppressing 
him." 

At  that  moment  a  voice  was  heard  in  the  sky,  saying  : — 

"  O  Rama,  do  not  slay  the  vulture  for  it  has  already  been 
reduced  to  ashes  by  the  power  of  Gautama's  asceticism.  O  Lord 
of  Men,  this  vulture  in  a  former  birth  was  an  heroic,  truthful  and 
pure  king,  by  the  name  of  Brahmadatta.  One  day  a  brahmin 
called  Gautama,  the  very  personification  of  Time,  came  to  the 
house  of  Brahmadatta  for  food  and  said  : — 

"  '  O  King,  I  shall  feed  in  thy  house  for  more  than  a  hundred 
years  ! ' 

"  Thereupon,  with  his  own  hands  offering  that  effulgent 
brahmin  water  to  wash  his  feet,  the  King  Brahmadatta  enter- 
tained him  with  due  hospitality.  Once,  accidentally,  flesh  was 
mixed  with  the  food  of  the  high-souled  Gautama  and  he, 
enraged,  uttered  a  terrible  curse,  saying : — *  O  King,  do  thou 
become  a  vulture  ! ' 

"  The  monarch  thereupon  replied  : — '  O  Thou  of  great  vows, 
do  not  curse  me  thus,  be  propitiated,  it  was  in  ignorance  that 
this  offence  was  offered  by  me,  O  Great  One !  O  Blameless  One, 
do  thou  so  act  that  this  curse  be  rendered  void  ! ' 

"  Recognizing  that  the  offence  had  been  unwittingly  com- 
mitted by  the  king,  the  ascetic  said  : — 

"  '  O  King,  a  monarch  shall  be  born  under  the  name  of  Rama 
in  the  Race  of  Ikshvaku.  O  Foremost  of  Men,  thou  shall  be 
released  from  the  curse  when  he  touches  thee.'  " 

Hearing  these  words  from  the  sky,  Rama  touched  Brahma- 
datta and  he,  giving  up  his  vulture's  form,  assuming  a  beautiful 
body  sprinkled  with  celestial  perfumes,  worshipped  Rama  and 
said: —

"  0  Thou  conversant  with  piety,  fay  thy  grace  I  have  been 
saved  from  a  dreadful  hell,  thou  hast  verily  brought  the  curse  to 
an  end  for  me  f  " 


CHAPTER    60 

The  Ascetics  seek  out  Rama 

As  Rama  and  Lakshmana  passed  the  time  conversing  thus,  the 
temperate  spring  night  drew  on  and,  when  the  stainless  dawn 
broke,  Kakutstha,  having  performed  his  morning  worship,  went 
to  the  audience  chamber  to  attend  to  affairs  of  state. 

Then  Sumantra  approached  him  and  said  : — 

"  O  King,  there  are  some  Sages  who  are  waiting  at  the  gate 
with  Chyavana,  the  descendant  of  Bhrigu,  at  their  head  ;  these 
illustrious  Rishis  seek  audience  with  thee,  O  Great  King,  and, 
eager  for  thy  sight,  those  dwellers  on  the  banks  of  the  Yamuna 
have  sent  me  to  announce  their  arrival." 

Hearing  these  words,  the  virtuous  Rama,  conversant  with  his 
duty,  said : — "  Let  those  blessed  ascetics,  whose  leader  is 
Bhargava,  enter."  Thereupon,  in  deference  to  the  king's 
summons,  the  chamberlain,  with  joined  palms,  bowing  low, 
ushered  in  those  eminent  ascetics,  numbering  over  a  hundred, 
who  were  blazing  in  their  own  effulgence.  Thereafter  those 
magnanimous  Sages,  entering  the  palace,  with  their  loshtas 
filled  with  holy  water  drawn  from  sacred  places,  carried  various 
kinds  of  fruit  and  roots  as  an  offering  to  the  king,  which  Rama 
accepted  with  delight. 

Then  that  long-armed  prince  said  to  those  illustrious  Sages  :— 

"  Do  you  occupy  these  seats  according  to  your  pleasure." 

Thus  invited  by  Rama,  those  great  Rishis  took  their  places  on 
the  brilliant  golden  seats  and,  seeing  them  installed,  Rama,  with 
joined  palms,  paying  obeisance  to  them,  enquired  of  them 
saying ; — 

"  For  what  reason  have  you  come  ?  In  my  devotion  I  would 

feign  know  what  I  may  do  for  you  ?  I  am  at  your  command  O 

Illustrious  Ones,  and  shall  carry  out  all  you  desire  with  great 

delight.    My  whole  kingdom  and  the  life  in  my  breast  and  all 

558 


UTTARA    KANDA 

that  I  am  is  at  the  service  of  the  Twice-born  ;  this  is  the  truth 
that  I  speak ! " 

Hearing  this  speech,  the  magnanimous  Rishis  of  severe 
penances,  who  dwelt  on  the  banks  of  the  Yamuna,  cried  out : — 
*'  Excellent !  "  and  with  extreme  delight,  they  added  : — 

"  O  Thou,  the  best  of  Men,  none  other  on  this  earth  would 
speak  as  thou  hast  done.  Many  monarchs,  though  supremely 
courageous  and  powerful,  dare  not  engage  themselves  in  an 
undertaking  when  they  consider  the  difficulties  ;  thou,  however, 
without  even  knowing  in  what  the  matter  consists,  in  thy 
reverence  for  the  brahmins,  dost  pledge  thy  word  which  thou 
wilt  undoubtedly  honour.  It  behoveth  thee  to  deliver  the  Sages 
from  a  great  peril,  O  Lord." 

CHAPTER     6l 

The  Story  of  Madhu 

Then  Kakutstha  enquired  of  those  ascetics,  who  had  spoken 
thus,  saying : — 

"  Say  what  shall  I  do,  O  Munis,  in  order  to  dispel  this  danger 
for  you  ?  *' 

At  these  words  from  Kakutstha,  Bhargava  replied  : — 

"  Learn  the  cause  of  our  fears  and  from  whence  they  spring, 
O  Prince !  Formerly  in  the  Krita-yuga,  a  highly  intelligent 
Daitya,  the  great  Asura  Madhu,  the  eldest  son  of  Lola,  who  was 
well-disposed  to  the  brahmins  and  protected  all  those  who 
sought  refuge  in  him,  was  united  in  an  unequalled  friendship 
to  the  supremely  illustrious  Gods.  And  Madhu,  who  was 
endowed  with  valour  and  ever  fixed  in  his  duty,  received  a 
marvellous  weapon  from  Rudra,  who  held  htm  in  high  esteem. 
Taking  from  his  own  trident,  another  of  great  power  and  beauty, 
that  magnanimous  One,  well  pleased,  conferred  it  upon  him  and 
said : — 

"  '  Thou  hast  fulfilled  thy  duty  in  a  remarkable  degree,  which 
has  evoked  my  grace !  In  the  supreme  delight  that  I  now  experi- 
ence, I  confer  this  excellent  weapon  upon  thee.  As  long  as  thou 
dost  not  attack  the  Gods  or  the  brahmins,  O  Great  Asura,  this 
559 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

spear  will  remain  with  thee,  otherwise  it  will  vanish.  Whoever 
rashly  provokes  thee  to  combat  will  be  reduced  to  ashes  by  this 
weapon  which,  thereafter,  will  return  to  thine  hand  ! ' 

"  Having  received  this  rare  gift  from  Rudra,  the  great  Asura 
prostrated  himself  before  Mahadeva  and  said  : — 

"  *  O  Lord,  Thou  who  art  the  Chief  of  the  Gods,  O  Blessed 
One,  may  this  weapon  ever  remain  in  my  family.' 

"  Thus  spoke  Madhu,  and  the  Lord  of  all  beings,  Shiva,  that 
great  God,  anwered  him  saying : — 

" '  Nay,  that  may  not  be,  nevertheless  since  thy  plea  finds 
favour  with  me,  it  shall  not  have  been  uttered  in  vain  ;  thy  son 
shall  inherit  this  weapon.  As  long  as  it  is  in  his  hand,  he  will 
be  invulnerable  to  all  beings,  but  only  if  it  remains  there.' 

"  Then  Madhu,  the  foremost  of  the  Asuras,  having  received 
that  great  and  marvellous  gift  from  the  God,  built  himself  a 
magnificent  abode.  He  had  a  beloved  wife,  the  fortunate  and 
illustrious  Kumbhinasi,  who  was  born  of  Vishvasu  by  Anala,  and 
she  bore  him  a  son  full  of  vigour  named  Lavana.  Cruel  and 
perverse  from  infancy,  he  was  ever  engaged  in  harming  others 
and,  seeing  the  iniquitous  conduct  of  his  son,  Madhu  was 
incensed  and  grieved  but  he  said  nothing.  After  a  time  he  left 
this  world  and  entered  Varuna's  abode,  having  bequeathed  the 
weapon  to  Lavana  and  instructed  him  in  the  nature  of  the  gift. 

"  Now  Lavana,  due  to  the  power  of  that  weapon  and  his 
natural  perversity,  has  become  the  scourge  of  the  Three  Worlds 
and  particularly  of  the  Sages,  his  might  being  equalled  by  the 
power  of  that  weapon.  Thou  hast  heard  all,  now  it  is  for  thee  to 
decide,  O  Kakutstha,  for  thou  art  our  supreme  refuge. 

"  Many  monarchs,  O  Rama,  have  been  solicited  by  the  Sages 
to  deliver  them  from  fear,  but,  O  Valiant  Prince,  we  have  not 
found  a  protector.  Learning  that  thou  hadst  destroyed  Ravana 
with  his  infantry  and  cavalry,  we  have  recognized  thee  as  our 
saviour,  O  Dear  Son.  We  know  of  no  other  king  on  earth  capable 
of  delivering  us  ;  we  entreat  thee  to  free  us  from  the  terror  which 
Lavana  inspires  in  us.  This,  O  Rama,  is  the  cause  of  our  present 
fear ;  thou  art  able  to  dispel  it ;  fulfil  our  desire,  O  Thou  whose 
valour  is  unconquerable."

CHAPTER     62 

Shatrughna  asks  permission  to  fight  Lavana 

Such  was  the  speech  of  the  ascetics,  and  Rama,  with  joined 
palms,  enquired  of  them,  saying : — 

"On  what  does  he  live?  How  does  he  conduct  himself? 
Where  does  he  dwell  ?  " 

Raghava,  having  questioned  them  thus,  all  the  ascetics 
informed  him  as  to  how  Lavana  sustained  himself  and  said  : — 

"  His  food  consists  of  all  creatures,  particularly  the  ascetics, 
his  manner  of  life  is  savage  and  he  constantly  roams  in  Madhu- 
vana.  Having  slain  thousands  of  lions,  tigers,  antelopes,  birds 
and  even  men,  his  daily  food  is  their  flesh,  and  that  monster,  like 
unto  Antaka  at  the  dissolution  of  the  worlds,  also  devours  all 
beings." 

Hearing  these  words,  Raghava  said  to  those  great  Sages  : — 

"  I  shall  slay  that  demon,  have  no  fear."  Having  given  his 
word  to  the  ascetics  of  great  effulgence,  Rama,  the  delight  of 
Raghu  said  to  his  three  brothers  who  were  present : — 

"  Who  is  brave  enough  to  slay  this  Asura  ?  On  whom  shall 
the  choice  fall,  on  the  valiant  Bharata  or  the  sagacious 
Shatrughna  ?  " 

Listening  to  Raghava's  words,  Bharata  answered  : — "  It  is  I 
who  will  slay  him  !    Let  the  task  be  entrusted  to  me  !  " 

Hearing  Bharata,  full  of  energy  and  courage,  speak  thus, 
Shatrughna,  the  younger  brother  of  Lakshmana,  rose  from  his 
golden  seat  and,  bowing  before  that  Lord  of  Men,  said  : — 

"  The  long-armed  Bharata  has  already  proved  his  fortitude ; 
let  him  remain  amongst  us,  O  Joy  of  the  Raghus.  When 
Ayodhya  was  previously  deprived  of  thy  noble  person,  Bharata, 
concealing  his  sorrow  in  his  heart,  ruled  the  kingdom  till  the 
return  of  his  lord.  Undergoing  innumerable  hardships,  O 
Prince,  lying  on  a  hard  couch  in  Nandigrama,  the  supremely 
illustrious  Bharata  lived  on  fruit  and  roots,  his  hair  matted  and 
clothed  in  bark.  Having  endured  such  a  test,  that  son  of  Raghu 
should  not  have  to  undergo  further  trials  since  I,  thy  servant,  am 
here." 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Thus  spoke  Shatrughna  and  Raghava  said : — 
"  Be  it  so,  O  Descendant  of  Kakutstha,  carry  out  my  commands 
and  I  will  install  thee  as  king  in  the  splendid  capital  of  Madhu. 
O  Long-armed  Warrior,  let  Bharata  stay  here  as  thou  wishest  ^ 
thou  art  brave  and  experienced  and  well  able  to  establish  a 
kingdom  with  its  flourishing  provinces  and  a  capital  that  is 
washed  by  the  Yamuna,  for  he  who,  having  destroyed  a  dynasty, 
does  not  install  a  king,  goes  to  hell.  As  for  thee,  when  thou  hast 
slain  the  son  of  Madhu,  Lavana  of  perverse  ways,  do  thou 
govern  his  kingdom  righteously  if  thou  desirest  to  carry  out  my 
wishes.  Do  not  question  what  I  have  said,  O  Hero,  the  youn- 
ger brother  should  undoubtedly  obey  the  elder.  O  Descendant 
of  Kakutstha,  receive  the  consecration  at  my  hands  with  the 
traditional  blessings  pronounced  by  Vasishtha  and  the  other 
brahmins." 


CHAPTER     63 

The  Installation  of  Shatrughna 

These  words  of  Rama  filled  the  valiant  Shatrughna  with  con- 
fusion and  he  spoke  with  exceeding  diffidence,  saying : — 

"  O  Lord  of  Men,  these  measures  do  not  seem  to  me  to  be 
justified .'  How  may  a  younger  brother  be  installed  when  his 
elders  yet  live  ?  Still  it  is  imperative  that  I  should  submit  to 
thy  will,  O  Fortunate  Prince,  for  it  would  be  impossible  for  me 
to  disregard  any  order  of  thine.  I  have  heard  from  thy  lips,  O 
Hero,  and  the  scriptures  have  taught  me  that  one  should  never 
oppose  the  one  in  authority  once  he  has  spoken.  My  words 
were  ill-advised  when  I  said  '  I  will  slay  the  redoubtable  Lavana 
in  the  open  field.'  This  unfortunate  utterance  places  me  in  a 
serious  dilemma,  O  Foremost  of  Men.  One  should  not  add 
anything  when  one's  elders  have  spoken,  for  this  is  a  moral 
taint  and,  in  the  next  world,  proves  a  cause  of  retribution.  I 
shall  not  speak  again,  O  Lord  Kakutstha,  for  fear  that  a  second 
observation  draw  punishment  upon  me.  I  shall  do  thy  pleasure,. 
O  Foremost  of  Men,  O  Joy  of  Raghu,  but  do  thou  so  order  it 
that  in  mine  interest  this  improper  act  be  erased." 
562 


UTTARA    KANDA 

Thus  spoke  the  brave  and  high-souled  Shatrughna  and  Rama, 
greatly  delighted,  said  to  Bharata  and  Lakshmana  : — 

"  Prepare  everything  for  the  installation  with  care.  This  very 
day  I  shall  install  that  tiger  among  men,  issue  of  the  House  of 
Raghu.  At  my  command,  summon  the  Purodhas,  O  Offspring 
of  Kakutstha,  and  the  citizens,  Ritvijs  and  ministers." 

Hearing  the  king's  command,  the  great  car-warriors,  under 
the  direction  of  the  Purodhas,  began  the  ceremony.  Thereafter, 
the  lords  and  brahmins  entered  the  king's  palace  and  the 
enthronement  of  the  magnanimous  Shatrughna  was  solemnly 
performed,  to  the  great  delight  of  Raghava  and  the  city. 

The  fortunate  Shatrughna,  son  of  Kakutstha,  having  received 
the  divine  anointing,  resembled  a  second  sun,  as  Skanda  when 
he  was  formerly  enthroned  by  the  inhabitants  of  heaven  led  by 
Indra. 

Meanwhile  Shatrughna  being  installed  by  Rama  of  imperish- 
able exploits,  the  inhabitants  of  the  city  were  highly  delighted  as 
also  the  illustrious  brahmins,  and  Kaushalya,  Sumitra  and  also 
Kaikeyi,  who  with  the  other  queens,  rejoiced  in  their  royal 
residence. 

Thereafter  the  Rishis,  who  dwelt  on  the  banks  of  the  Yamuna, 
on  account  of  Shatrughna's  enthronement,  prophesied  the  death 
of  Lavana. 

Clasping  the  newly  crowned  one  to  his  heart,  Raghava,  in 
caressing  tones,  thus  enhancing  his  courage,  said  to  him  : — 

"  Here  is  an  infallible  shaft  that  overthrows  hostile  citadels  ; 
by  means  of  this  thou  shalt  destroy  Lavana,  O  My  Dear  Brother, 
Joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu.  It  was  fashioned,  O  Descendant  of 
Kakutstha,  when  Swyambhu,  the  divine  Ajita  reposed  on  the 
waters  out  of  sight  of  the  Gods  and  Asuras,  invisible  to  all  beings. 
That  God  fashioned  this  arrow,  the  foremost  of  all,  in  order  to 
slay  those  two  perverse  beings,  Madhu  and  Kaitabha,  for  he  was 
enraged  against  them,  when  he  desired  to  create  the  Three 
Worlds  despite  all  the  Rakshasas. 

"  Having  destroyed  Madhu  and  Kaitabha,  for  the  good  of  all 
beings  with  this  marvellous  weapon,  Brahma  created  the  worlds. 
I  did  not  loose  this  dart  formerly  on  Ravana,  whom  I  wished  to 
slay,  O  Shatrughna,  for  all  creatures  would  have  been  greatly 
diminished  thereby. 

563 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"As  for  the  superior  weapon  bestowed  on  Madhu  by  the 
magnanimous  Tryambaka  for  the  destruction  of  his  foes, 
Lavana,  while  he  is  ranging  the  regions  in  search  of  his  favourite 
nourishment,  leaves  it  in  his  dwelling  where  he  honours  it  in 
various  ways ;  but  when  the  desire  for  combat  rises  in  him  or  he 
is  challenged,  that  demon  lays  hold  of  that  weapon  and  reduces 
his  foes  to  ashes.  O  Foremost  of  Men,  ere  he  returns  to  the  city 
and  while  he  is  without  his  weapon,  place  thyself  at  the  entry 
furnished  with  thy  powerful  shaft.  Before  he  regains  his  abode, 
challenge  that  demon  to  combat,  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  and 
thou  shalt  overcome  him.  If  thou  actest  in  any  other  way,  thou 
canst  not  slay  him  ;  whereas  using  these  means,  O  Valiant  One, 
thou  wilt  exterminate  him.  Thou  knowest  all  and  how  to 
eschew  that  weapon  of  irresistible  force  belonging  to  the  ancient 
Shitikanta."' 


CHAPTER     64 

Shatrughna  sets  out  to  meet  Lavana 

Having  spoken  thus  to  Shatrughna,  the  offspring  of  Kakutstha, 
and  encouraged  him  again  and  again,  Rama,  the  Joy  of  the  House 
of  Raghu  continued  : — 

"  Here  are  four  thousand  horses,  two  thousand  chariots,  a 
hundred  selected  elephants  and  stalls  furnished  with  every 
provision,  also  singers  and  dancers.  O  Foremost  of  Men,  I  give 
thee  gold  and  silver  coins;  take  with  thee  a  quantity  of  gold  and 
set  out,  having  furnished  thyself  with  supplies  of  weapons,  food 
and  conveyances. 

"  By  words  and  gifts,  do  thou  satisfy  that  well-nourished  army 
that  is  cheerful,  contented  and  disciplined,  O  Valiant  Prince. 
Where  there  are  neither  riches,  women  nor  kinsfolk,  devoted 
servants  will  not  be  found,  O  Shatrughna.  Having  marshalled 
thy  great  army  composed  of  people  full  of  ardour,  do  thou  go 
alone,  bow  in  hand  to  the  Madhu  Wood.  Act  in  such  a  manner 
that  Lavana,  the  son  of  Madhu,  is  not  aware  that  thou  art 
approaching,  seeking  to  enter  into  combat  with  him,  that  he  may

UTTARA    KANDA 

be  without  suspicion ;  there  is  no  other  means  of  slaying  him. 
O  Foremost  of  Men,  he  who  approaches  him  with  that  purpose 
inevitably  perishes  under  his  blows.  The  summer  having  passed 
and  the  rainy  season  being  at  hand,  thou  shalt  destroy  the  wicked 
Lavana  for  the  hour  will  have  struck ! 

"  With  the  great  Rishis  at  their  head,  send  the  troops  forward 
so  that  they  profit  by  the  summer  for  crossing  the  waters  of  the 
Jahnavi.  There  thou  shouldst  take  care  to  encamp  the  whole 
army  on  the  river  and  thou,  who  art  fleet  of  foot,  shouldst  go 
ahead  with  thy  bow.  Halt  at  the  place  indicated  to  you  and 
establish  the  camps  without  obstruction  so  that  no-one  may  have 
cause  for  complaint." 

Having  thus  issued  his  orders  and  marshalled  his  army, 
Shatrughna  circumambulated  Rama,  bowing  to  him,  with 
joined  palms,  and  in  great  humility,  paid  obeisance  to  Bharata 
and  Lakshmana  as  also  the  family  priest,  Shri  Vasishtha. 

Having  received  permission  from  Rama  to  depart,  that  hero, 
the  Scourge  of  His  Foes,  circumambulated  him  and  went  away. 
Ordering  his  army,  comprising  innumerable  elephants  and  well- 
bred  steeds  to  advance,  that  descendant  of  Raghu  took  leave  of 
the  king  and  set  out  on  his  mission. 


CHAPTER     65 

The  Story  of  Saudasa  who  is  cursed  by  the  Sage  Vasishtha 

Having  caused  his  army  to  halt  after  a  month's  march, 
Shatrughna  started  out  alone  with  a  rapid  step.  Two  days  later,  that 
hero,  the  Joy  of  the  Raghus  reached  the  sacred  hermitage  of 
Valmiki,  the  foremost  of  retreats,  and,  with  joined  palms,  paying 
obeisance  to  that  magnanimous  Sage,  spoke  thus : — 

"  O  Blessed  One,  I  desire  to  spend  the  night  here  where  the 
mission  of  my  elder  brother  has  led  me ;  to-morrow,  at  dawn,  I 
shall  set  out  for  the  west." 

Thus  spoke  the  great-souled  Shatrughna,  and  the  foremost  of 
Sages,  smiling,  answered  him,  saying  : — 

"  Be  thou  welcome,  O  Illustrious  Prince  !  This  hermitage,  O 
dear  Friend,  belongs  to  the  descendants  of  the  Raghu  Race  also; 

ao  565 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

without  hesitation,  do  thou  accept  a  seat  from  me  and  water  for 
thy  hands  and  feet !  " 

Thereupon,  Shatrughna,  being  honoured,  accepted  the  fruits 
and  roots  for  his  repast  and,  being  fed  thereon  till  he  was  fully 
satisfied,  then  enquired  of  the  great  Rishi,  saying : — 

"  Whose  is  this  fertile  area  to  the  east  of  the  hermitage,  that 
has  been  created  by  sacrifice  ?  "' 

To  this  enquiry,  Valmiki  replied  : — 

"  O  Shatrughna,  hear  to  whom  this  region  formerly  belonged  ! 
One  of  thine  ancestors  was  the  King  Saudasa  and,  of  that 
monarch  was  born  Mitrasaha,:  who  was  full  of  vigour  and 
extremely  virtuous.  One  day  the  valiant  and  righteous  Saudasa, 
having  followed  the  hunt,  observed  two  Rakshasas  wandering 
here  and  there,  in  the  form  of  tigers,  and  those  monsters  were 
devouring  thousands  of  antelopes  in  order  to  appease  their 
insatiable  appetites.  Seeing  those  two  Rakshasas,  who  had 
denuded  the  forest  of  deer,  Saudasa  was  seized  with  violent 
anger  and  pierced  one  of  them  with  a  long  dart.  Having  slain 
it,  that  foremost  of  men  recovered  his  composure  and,  his  anger 
dissipated,  he  gazed  on  the  dead  Rakshasa.  Observing  him 
contemplating  his  companion  thus,  the  surviving  demon,  filled 
with  a  burning  grief,  said  to  him  : — 

" '  Thou  hast  slain  my  companion  who  had  done  thee  no 
harm,  I  shall  revenge  myself  on  thee  one  day,  thou  wretch  ! ' 

"  Speaking  thus,  the  Rakshasa  disappeared. 

"  In  the  course  of  time,  the  son  of  Saudasa,  Mitrasaha,  came 
to  the  throne,  and  Saudasa  undertook  the  Ashwamedha  Sacrifice 
in  the  vicinity  of  this  ashrama  with  Vasishtha  as  the  officiating 
priest.  This  continued  for  many  years  and  was  of  exceeding 
splendour  so  that  it  resembled  one  offered  by  the  Gods.  At  the 
close  of  the  rites,  the  Rakshasa,  calling  to  mind  his  past  grievance, 
assumed  the  form  of  Vasishtha  and  said  to  the  king  : — 

"  '  Now  the  sacrifice  has  been  completed,  let  flesh  be  brought 
speedily  that  I  may  eat  without  delay  !  * 

"  Hearing  that  Rakshasa,  transformed  into  a  brahmin, 
speaking  thus,  the  king  addressed  his  cooks,  who  were  skilled  in 
their  art  and  said : — 

1  That  is  by  the  grain  scattered  during  the  sacrifice. 
1  In  some  versions,  Viryasaha 

566 


UTTARA    KANDA 

" '  Speedily  prepare  Havis1  and  such  savoury  dishes  of  flesh 
that  will  please  my  Guru  ! ' 

"  This  command  of  that  monarch  bewildered  the  cooks, 
whereupon  the  Rakshasa,  assuming  their  form,  prepared  a  dish 
of  human  flesh  which  he  brought  to  the  king,  saying,  '  Here  is  a 
savoury  dish  made  of  flesh ! ' 

"  O  Foremost  of  Men,  the  king,  with  his  consort,  Madayanti, 
presented  those  dishes  brought  by  the  Rakshasa,  that  were 
composed  of  flesh,  to  the  Sage  Vasishtha,  and  that  ascetic, 
perceiving  he  had  been  offered  human  flesh,  was  transported 
with  rage  and  began  to  pronounce  a  curse  upon  him,  saying : — 

"  '  Since  it  has  pleased  thee,  O  King,  to  offer  me  a  repast  of 
this  nature,  it  shall  assuredly  become  thy  food.' 

"  Thereupon  Saudasa,  incensed,  in  his  turn  took  water  in  his 
hand  and  was  about  to  curse  Vasishtha  when  his  wife  restrained 
him,  saying : — 

"  (  O  King,  since  the  blessed  Sage  is  our  spiritual  Preceptor,  it 
is  not  proper  for  thee  to  pronounce  a  curse  upon  him,  a  priest  is 
like  unto  a  God.' 

"  Then  that  virtuous  monarch  poured  out  that  water  charged 
with  power  and  some  fell  on  his  feet,  which  became  stained  and, 
from  that  time  the  illustrious  Saudasa  became  known  as 
Kaimashapada.3  Then  that  monarch,  with  his  consort,  having 
prostrated  themselves  before  Vasishtha  again  and  again,  in- 
formed him  of  what  the  Rakshasa,  under  the  shape  of  a  brahmin, 
had  done. 

"  Hearing  from  that  foremost  of  monarchs  of  the  vile  act  of 
the  Rakshasa,  Vasishtha  addressed  the  king  once  more,  saying  : — 

M  *  The  words  that  I  have  pronounced  in  anger  nay  not  be 
uttered  in  vain  but  I  will  grant  thee  a  boon.  Thou  shalt  be  freed 
from  the  curse  in  twelve  years  and,  by  my  favour,  shall  not 
remember  what  has  passed,  O  Foremost  of  Men.' 

"  Having  suffered  the  consequences  of  that  curse,  Saudasa, 
the  Slayer  of  His  Foes,  recovered  his  kingdom  and  ruled  over 
his  subjects.  O  Descendant  of  Raghu,  this  is  the  beautiful  site 
of  that  sacrifice  performed  by  Kaimashapada  about  which  thou 
hast  enquired."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Having  heard  the  dreadful  story  of  that  monarch,  Shatrughna, 
paying  obeisance  to  that  great  Rishi,  entered  the  leaf-thatched 
hut. 

CHAPTER    66 

The  Birth  of  Kusha  and  Lava 

Now,  during  the  night  that  Shatrughna  passed  in  the  leaf- 
thatched  hut,  Sita  gave  birth  to  two  children  and,  at  midnight, 
the  youthful  ascetics  brought  the  pleasant  and  auspicious  tidings 
to  Valmiki,  saying  : — 

"  O  Blessed  One,  Rama's  consort  has  given  birth  to  twin  sons, 
do  thou  perform  the  rites  that  will  preserve  them  from  evil 
forces." 

Hearing  these  words,  the  great  Rishi  went  to  see  those  newly- 
born  Ones,  who  were  as  effulgent  as  the  new  moon  and  full  of 
vigour,  like  unto  twin  offspring  of  the  Gods. 

Coming  to  where  Sita  was,  on  beholding  those  two  infants,  his 
heart  was  filled  with  delight  and  he  performed  the  Rakshasa 
Rite.1  Taking  a  handful  of  Kusha  Grass  with  its  roots,  that 
Twice-born  One,  Valmiki,  pronounced  the  formula  of  protection 
for  the  destruction  of  evil  forces,  saying  : — 

"  Since  they  will  rub  the  first  born  of  the  children  with  the 
Kusha  Grass1  blessed  by  the  aid  of  Mantras,  his  name  shall  be 
Kusha  and,  as  the  last  born  will  be  carefully  dried  by  the  female 
ascetics  with  the  roots  of  the  grass,  he  shall  be  called  Lava. 
Therefore  those  two  shall  be  called  Kusha  and  Lava  and,  by 
these  names  that  I  have  given  them,  they  will  become  renowned." 

Thereafter,  the  female  ascetics  purified  themselves  and 
reverently  received  the  grass  from  the  hands  of  the  Muni, 
applying  it  to  the  two  children.  The  rite  having  been  performed 
in  the  night,  Shatrughna  hearing  the  pleasant  tidings,  the  names 
the  children  would  bear,  and  Rama's  praises,  also  that  Sita  had 
undergone  this  double  and  fortunate  birth,  approached  the  leaf- 
thatched  hut  where  Sita  lay  and  said  : — 

"  O  Mother,  be  thou  happy  !  "

rainy  season  in  the  month  of  Shravana  passed  joyfully  and 
rapidly  and,  the  next  day  at  dawn,  that  great  hero,  having  offered 
up  his  morning  devotions,  with  joined  palms  paid  obeisance  to 
the  Sage  and  resumed  his  journey. 

After  a  march  of  seven  days,  reaching  the  banks  of  the 
Yamuna,  he  halted  at  the  hermitage  of  Rishis  of  great  renown, 
and  that  illustrious  Prince  listened  to  the  pleasant  and  ancient 
legends  of  Chyavana  of  the  line  of  Bhrigu  and  of  other  Sages. 
In  this  way,  Shatrughna,  the  son  of  that  foremost  of  monarchs, 
King  Dasaratha,  in  great  delight,  passed  the  night  conversing 
with  the  ascetics,  of  whom  Kancana  was  the  leader,  on  various 
themes. 


CHAPTER    67 

The  Story  of  Mandhata 

The  night  having  come,  Shatrughna  enquired  of  the  son  of 
Bhrigu,  Chyavana,  concerning  the  strength  of  Lavana,  saying : — 

"  O  Brahmin,  how  powerful  is  his  weapon  ?  Who  did  Lavana 
formerly  slay  with  that  splendid  shaft  in  combat  ?  " 

Thus  questioned  by  him,  the  extremely  virtuous  Chyavana 
answered  the  magnanimous  Shatrughna,  the  Joy  of  the  Raghus, 
saying : — 

"  O  Son  of  Raghu,  innumerable  are  his  exploits  !  Hear  what 
befell  a  descendant  of  Ikshvaku.  Formerly  there  reigned  in 
Ayodhya,  the  valiant  son  of  Yavanashwa,  Mandhata,  who  was 
renowned  in  the  Three  Worlds  for  his  prowess. 

"  Having  placed  the  entire  earth  under  his  yoke,  that  monarch 
sought  to  conquer  the  Celestial  Realm.  Great  was  the  fear  of 
Indra  and  the  Gods  on  beholding  Mandhata's  preparations,  who 
wished  to  conquer  the  region  of  the  Devas.  Learning  of  his 
intention  to  share  Indra's  throne  and  kingdom,  the  God,  who 
chastised  Paka,  addressed  Yuvanashwa's  son  in  propitiatory 
accents  and  said  :— 

" '  Thou  dost  not  yet  rule  over  the  entire  earth,  not  having 
wholly  subjugated  it,  O  King,  yet  thou  aspirest  to  the  celestial 
throne.  When  the  whole  earth  is  under  thy  dominion,  then, 
569 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

with  thy  servants,  thine  army  and  thy  chariots,  do  thou  take 
possession  of  the  kingdom  of  the  Gods.' 
"  Thus  did  Indra  speak,  and  Mandhata  answered  him,  saying  : 
"  '  Who  on  the  face  of  the  earth  has  contested  my  domina- 
tion ? '    Then  the  God  of  a  Thousand  Eyes  said  : — 

"  '  The  Rakshasa  named  Lavana,  son  of  Madhu,  who  dwells 
in  the  forest,  has  not  recognized  thine  authority,  O  Irreproach- 
able Warrior ! ' 

"At  these  extremely  unpleasing  words  uttered  by  Indra,  the 
king  hung  his  head  in  shame,  being  unable  to  answer  him. 
Thereafter,  paying  obeisance  to  the  Thousand-eyed  God,  he 
departed  with  bowed  head  and  returned  to  earth. 

"  Then  that  Prince,  the  Slayer  of  His  Foes,  concealing  his 
anger,  placed  himself  at  the  head  of  his  servants,  infantry  and 
cavalry  and  marched  against  the  son  of  Madhu  in  order  to  con- 
quer him.  And  that  foremost  of  men  sent  a  messenger  to  Lavana 
to  challenge  him  to  combat,  who,  coming  before  him,  covered 
the  son  of  Madhu  with  abuses  and,  while  he  was  still  speaking, 
the  Rakshasa  devoured  him. 

"As  his  envoy  failed  to  return,  the  king,  enraged,  assailed 
Lavana  with  a  hail  of  arrows,  whereupon  the  Rakshasa,  taking 
up  his  trident,  mockingly  hurled  it  upon  him  in  order  to  exter- 
minate him  and  his  followers,  and  the  flaming  trident,  that 
formidable  weapon,  reduced  the  king,  his  servants,  his  infantry 
and  cavalry  to  ashes  and  returned  to  the  hand  of  its  master. 

"  Thus  did  that  great  monarch  perish  with  his  footsoldiers  and 
chariots.  O  My  Friend,  it  was  through  the  power  of  that  trident, 
which  is  unsurpassed  !  To-morrow  at  dawn  thou  shalt  without 
doubt  slay  Lavana  ere  he  has  taken  up  his  weapon  ;  thy  victory 
is  assured  !  The  worlds  will  be  freed  as  a  result  of  thine  exploit. 
O  Foremost  of  Men,  I  have  now  told  thee  all  concerning  the 
wicked  Lavana  ;  it  is  on  this  account  that  Mandhata  succumbed 
in  his  undertaking.  To-morrow  at  dawn,  O  Magnanimous  One, 
thou  shalt  undoubtedly  slay  him  !  He  will  have  set  out  in  search 
of  food  without  his  trident.  Thy  victory  is  therefore  assured,  O 
Foremost  of  Men."

CHAPTER     68 

Shatrughna  encounters  Lavana 

Whilst  Chyavana  was  recounting  this  story  and  all  were  wishing 
him  an  overwhelming  victory,  the  night  speedily  passed  away 
for  the  magnanimous  Shatrughna. 

Meantime  as  the  cloudless  dawn  broke,  the  bold  Rakshasa  set 
out  from  the  city  eager  to  find  food  and,  during  this  time  the 
intrepid  Shatrughna  crossed  the  Yamuna  and,  bow  in  hand,  took 
up  his  position  at  the  gate  of  Madhupura. 

At  noon,  that  Rakshasa  of  evil  karma  returned  laden  with 
countless  living  beings  and,  beholding  Shatrughna  standing  at 
the  gate  with  his  weapon,  the  demon  enquired  of  him : — 

"  What  wilt  thou  do  with  that  weapon  ?  In  my  wrath,  O 
Least  of  Warriors,  I  have  devoured  thousands  of  men  like  thee 
with  their  weapons  ;  it  is  death  that  brings  thee  here.  I  am  not 
yet  fully  fed,  O  Vilest  of  Men,  why  hast  thou  come  to  cast  thyself 
into  my  mouth,  thou  fool !  " 

Thus  did  he  speak,  laughing  loudly,  and  the  courageous 
Shatrughna  shed  tears  of  rage  and,  in  his  fury,  sparks  of  fire 
issued  from  all  his  limbs.  Thereafter,  in  a  transport  of  anger,  he 
said  to  that  ranger  of  the  night : — 

"  I  shall  enter  into  single  combat  with  thee  !  I  am  the  son  of 
Dasaratha,  the  brother  of  the  sagacious  Rama,  my  name  is 
Shatrughna,  a  veritable  Shatrughna,1  and  it  is  my  desire  to  slay 
thee  that  has  brought  me  hither !  I  wish  to  fight  with  thee, 
therefore  be  on  thy  guard  !  Thou  art  the  enemy  of  all  beings  ; 
thou  shalt  not  escape  me  alive  !  " 

At  these  words  the  Rakshasa,  sneering,  answered  the  prince, 
saying: — 

"  It  is  my  good  fortune  that  has  brought  thee  to  me,  O 
Insensate  One.  Rama  slew  my  maternal  aunt's  brother,  Ravana, 
on  account  of  a  woman,  O  Wretch.  O  Lord  of  Men,  I  have 
suffered  the  entire  destruction  of  Ravana's  family  and  it  is 
because  I  have  neglected  to  avenge  them  that  thou  art  over- 
confident.   I  shall  exterminate  you  all,  O  Vilest  of  Men,  I  shall

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

sweep  you  all  away  like  straws,  both  those  who  arc  already  born 
and  those  still  to  be  born.  O  Thou  of  vicious  intellect,  I  accept 
thy  challenge  !  Stay  but  a  moment  till  I  fetch  my  weapon,  one 
suited  to  thy  destruction  !  " 
Thereupon  Shatrughna  instantly  answered  saying : — 
"  What,  shalt  thou  escape  me  alive  ?  He  who  has  any  wit 
does  not  allow  a  foe  to  go  free  who  has  come  forth  of  his  own 
accord.  He,  who,  in  his  stupidity,  suffers  a  foe  to  escape, 
perishes.  Look  long  on  the  world,  for,  with  my  whetted  shafts, 
I  shall  despatch  thee  to  Yama's  abode,  thou  the  enemy  of  the 
Three  Worlds  and  of  Raghava." 


chapter    69 

Tlie  Death  of  Lavana 

At  these  words  from  the  mighty  Shatrughna,  Lavana  fell  into  a 
violent  rage  and  cried  out : — "  Stay  ",  striking  his  hands  together 
and  grinding  his  teeth,  thereafter  assailing  that  Lion  of  the  Raghus 
with  redoubled  blows. 

Thereupon  Shatrughna,  the  Slayer  of  His  Foes,  answered 
Lavana  of  formidable  aspect,  who  had  addressed  him  thus, 
saying  :— 

"  When  others  were  slain  by  thee,  I  was  not  yet  born,  but 
to-day,  pierced  by  my  darts,  do  thou  enter  the  region  of  Yama  ! 
May  the  Rishis  and  learned  brahmins  this  day  be  witness  of  thy 
death  in  combat,  O  Wretch  !  When  my  shafts  have  consumed 
thee  in  the  fight,  thou  who  art  a  ranger  of  the  night,  the  city 
and  the  country  too  will  be  at  peace.  As  the  rays  of  the  sun 
penetrate  the  lotus,  so  shall  the  dreadful  pointed  arrows,  loosed 
by  mine  arm,  pierce  thy  heart." 

Then  Lavana,  beside  himself  with  anger  on  hearing  these 
words,  hurled  a  great  tree  on  Shatrughna  striking  his  breast,  but 
he  severed  it  into  a  hundred  pieces,  and  the  Rakshasa,  finding 
himself  foiled,  seized  hold  of  a  large  number  of  trees  and  hurled 
them  on  his  adversary;  then  Shatrughna,  burning  with  ardour, 
severed  those  innumerable  trees,  one  by  one,  with  three  or  four 

572 


UTTARA    KANDA 

well-seasoned  crescent-shaped  arrows  and,  thereafter,  he  let  a 
shower  of  darts  fall  on  the  valiant  Rakshasa  without  causing  him 
to  retreat.  With  a  mocking  laugh,  Lavana,  brandishing  a  tree, 
struck  the  head  of  that  hero  so  that  he  fell  insensible,  and  when 
that  warrior  fell,  a  great  cry  of  "Ah !  Ah !  "  arose  from  the 
Rishis,  Devas,  Gandharvas  and  also  Apsaras. 

Thereupon  the  Rakshasa,  thinking  Shatrughna  to  be  slain, 
did  not  enter  his  house,  though  the  opportunity  presented 
itself  and,  seeing  him  lying  on  the  earth,  he  did  not  go  in  search 
of  his  trident,  but,  reflecting,  "  He  is  dead,"  he  began  to  collect 
his  food. 

Shatrughna,  however,  regaining  his  senses,  in  an  instant  took 
hold  of  his  weapon  and  went  to  his  place  at  the  city  gate  once 
more,  amidst  the  acclamations  of  the  Rishis  ;  and  he  selected  a 
celestial,  infallible  and  marvellous  arrow  that  illumined  the 
ten  regions  with  its  brilliance  and  resembled  lightning  in  its 
velocity.  That  shaft,  smeared  with  sandalpaste  of  the  colour  of 
blood,  wonderfully  plumed,  was  greatly  feared  by  the  leaders  of 
the  Danavas,  the  mountains  and  also  the  Asuras,  and,  beholding 
that  dreadful  weapon,  naming  like  Time  at  the  end  of  the  world 
period,  all  beings  were  seized  with  terror.  Then  Devas,  Asuras, 
Gandharvas  and  troops  of  Apsaras  and  the  whole  universe 
trembled  and  took  refuge  with  the  Grandsire  of  the  worlds. 
Thereafter  the  Gods,  beside  themselves  with  fear,  enquired  of 
that  Lord  of  Lords,  the  Bestower  of  Grace,  the  Grandsire  of  the 
Worlds,  whether  the  universe  were  about  to  be  destroyed. 
Hearing  them  speak  thus,  Brahma,  the  Grandsire,  addressed 
them  in  soothing  accents,  that  restored  their  serenity,  saying  : — 

"  Hear  me,  O  Ye  Gods,  it  is  in  order  to  destroy  Lavana  in 
combat  that  Shatrughna  is  armed  with  that  weapon.  O  Fore- 
most of  the  Gods,  all  are  overwhelmed  by  the  power  of  this 
eternal  weapon  forged  by  the  primeval  God,  the  Creator  of  the 
World.  O  My  Children,  that  effulgent  shaft  which  causes  such 
terror  was  fashioned  for  the  destruction  of  the  demons,  Madhu 
and  Kaitabha,  by  the  magnanimous  God,  Vishnu,  who  alone 
understands  it.  In  reality,  it  is  the  primeval  form  of  Vishnu 
Himself,  therefore  go  and  witness  the  death  of  the  foremost  of 
the  Rakshasas,  Lavana,  under  the  blows  of  that  valiant  warrior, 
the  younger  brother  of  Rama." 

573 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

At  these  words  of  that  God  of  Gods,  the  Devas  went  to  the 
place  where  the  combat  between  Shatrughna  and  Lavana  was  in 
progress  and  that  weapon  of  celestial  effulgence,  which  Shat- 
rughna held  in  his  hand,  appeared  to  all  beings  like  the  Fire  that 
blazes  forth  at  the  dissolution  of  the  worlds  ! 

Beholding  the  firmament  filled  with  the  Celestial  Host,  the 
descendant  of  Raghu  emitted  a  leonine  roar  and,  thereafter,  looked 
on  Lavana  again  and  again.  On  this  renewed  provocation  from 
his  adversary,  the  Rakshasa,  enraged,  stretched  his  bow  up  to 
bis  ear  and  that  most  skilled  of  archers  discharged  his  great 
arrow  on  the  breast  of  the  enemy,  that  piercing  it,  entered  the 
lower  regions.  Having  penetrated  into  Rasatala  itself,  the 
celestial  weapon,  honoured  by  the  Gods,  immediately  returned 
to  that  hero,  the  Joy  of  the  Ikshvakus,  and,  pierced  by  Shat- 
rughna's  arrow,  Lavana,  that  ranger  of  the  night,  fell  like  a 
mountain  struck  by  lightning. 

Thereafter,  Lavana  being  slain  under  the  eyes  of  the  Gods, 
the  mighty  celestial  trident  returned  to  Rudra.  When,  with  a 
single  shaft,  that  hero  of  the  Raghus  destroyed  the  terror  of  the 
Three  Worlds  with  his  bow  and  marvellous  arrow,  he  resembled 
that  orb  of  a  thousand  rays  which  dispels  the  darkness. 

Then  the  Devas,  great  Rishis,  Pannagas  and  Apsaras  cried 
out  in  chorus  : — 

"  By  good  fortune,  the  son  of  Dasaratha  has  triumphed ; 
fear  is  banished  and,  like  a  great  reptile,  Lavana  lies  stretched  on 
the  earth." 

chapter    70 

Shatrughna  establishes  himself  in  the  City  of  Madhu 

Lavana  being  slain,  the  Gods  with  their  leaders,  led  by  Agni, 
spoke  to  Shatrughna  in  affectionate  terms,  saying : — 

"  By  good  fortune,  O  Dear  Child,  thou  art  victorious ;  by 
good  fortune,  Lavana  the  Rakshasa  is  destroyed  1  O  lion 
among  Men,  O  Pious  One,  do  thou  ask  for  a  boon.  The 
distributors  of  boons,  those  who  desired  thy  triumph,  are 
assembled  here,  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  let  not  our  presence 
prove  fruitless ! " 

574 


UTTARA    KANDA 

Hearing  these  words  of  the  Gods,  that  long-armed  warrior, 
Shatrughna,  placing  his  joined  palms  to  his  forehead,  answered 
humbly : — 

"  That  I  may  enter  into  possession  of  this  ravishing  and 
picturesque  city,  constructed  by  the  Gods,  is  my  dearest  wish  !  " 

Then  the  Celestials  answered  with  delight,  "  Be  it  so  !  this 
charming  city  shall  assuredly  become  Shurashena  !  "' 

At  these  words  the  high-souled  Celestials  returned  to  their 
abode ;  the  valiant  Shatrughna,  however,  summoned  his  army 
that  was  encamped  on  the  banks  of  the  Yamuna  and  the  troops 
immediately  came  to  that  place,  having  learned  of  his  victory, 
and  he  established  himself  there  in  the  month  of  Shravana. 

The  inhabitants  of  that  region  of  celestial  aspect  lived  there 
for  twelve  years  in  peace  and  happiness,  and  the  fields  abounded 
in  grain.  Under  the  aegis  of  Shatrughna's  arms,  Indra  sent  rain 
in  the  proper  season  and  the  city  was  full  of  healthy  and  happy 
people.  That  capital  had  the  brilliance  of  the  crescent  moon 
and  rose  in  splendour  on  the  banks  of  the  Yamuna ;  and  it  was 
magnificent  with  its  buildings  and  squares,  markets  and  high- 
ways and  the  inhabitants  who  belonged  to  the  four  castes. 

Shatrughna  had  embellished  the  magnificent  and  vast  edifices 
that  Lavana  had  formerly  constructed  and  painted  in  various 
colours.  Parks  and  places  of  entertainment  were  to  be  found  in 
all  parts  of  that  city,  which  was  also  adorned  with  works  of  art 
both  human  and  divine.  Of  a  celestial  aspect,  it  was  filled  with 
different  kinds  of  merchandise,  and  traders  from  every  country 
came  there.  Looking  on  that  opulent  city,  Shatrughna,  the 
younger  brother  of  Bharata,  at  the  height  of  prosperity  and 
happiness,  experienced  supreme  satisfaction. 

After  twelve  years  while  he  yet  dwelt  in  that  enchanting 
abode,  the  thought  came  to  him,  "  I  desire  to  behold  Rama 
again,"  thereupon,  while  residing  in  that  city  full  of  people  of 
every  condition,  tie  prince  resolved  to  look  on  the  feet  of  the 
Chief  of  the  Raghus  once  more.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     7  I 

Shatrughna  seeks  out  the  Sage  Valmiki 

Now  in  the  twelfth  year,  Shatrughna,  with  a  small  escort  of 
servants  and  soldiers,  desired  to  return  to  Ayodhya  where  Rama 
reigned.  Having  dissuaded  his  leading  counsellors  and  chief 
warriors  from  accompanying  him,  he  set  out  on  his  most 
excellent  steed  with  a  hundred  chariots. 

That  descendant  of  Raghu,  having  covered  fifteen  stages  (of 
the  journey)  reached  Valmiki's  hermitage  where  he  halted. 
Thereafter  that  foremost  of  men  paid  obeisance  to  the  ascetic, 
who,  as  host,  with  his  own  hands  offered  him  water  to  wash  his 
feet  and  the  Arghya.  Then  the  Sage  recounted  the  most 
agreeable  and  varied  traditions  to  the  magnanimous  Shatrughna 
and,  speaking  of  the  death  of  Lavana,  he  said  : — 

"  Thou  hast  accomplished  a  difficult  feat  in  slaying  him  !  O 
Valiant  Youth,  many  mighty  monarchs  with  their  troops  of 
infantry  and  cavalry  succumbed  in  their  struggle  with  Lavana. 
Thou  hast  slain  him  as  it  were  in  sport,  O  Foremost  of  Men! 
By  thy  valour,  the  fear  of  the  worlds  has  been  terminated.  The 
death  of  Ravana  was  brought  about  with  great  difficulty  by  Rama, 
but  this  marvellous  feat  of  arms  has  been  accomplished  by  thee 
without  any  trouble  whatsoever  !  At  the  fall  of  Lavana,  great 
joy  broke  out  amongst  the  Celestials  and  happiness  now  reigns 
amidst  all  beings  in  the  whole  world,  O  Prince  of  the  House  of 
Raghu !  Being  present  in  Vasava's  assembly,  I  witnessed  thy 
combat,  and  my  heart  too  was  filled  with  a  keen  felicity ;  now 
by  smelling  the  crown  of  thy  head,  I  testify  to  the  great  affection 
I  bear  for  thee." 

With  these  words,  the  illustrious  Valmiki  smelt  the  crown  of 
Shatrughna's  head  and  offered  him  and  his  followers  the 
traditional  hospitality. 

Having  eaten,  Shatrughna,  the  foremost  of  men,  listened  to 
the  sweetest  chants  which  told  the  history  of  Rama  and  how  all 
had  taken  place.  Stringed  instruments  accompanied  the  singing 
in  the  triple  mode'  which  was  expressive  and  melodic ;  and  he 

1  That  is  sung  from  the  heart,  throat  and  head. 

57« 


UTTARA    KANDA 

heard  the  story  of  Rama  and  what  had  formerly  been  achieved 
by  him ;  his  imperishable  exploits  as  they  had  taken  place  in 
time  gone  by,  and  that  foremost  of  men,  Shatrughna,  was 
transported,  his  eyes  full  of  tears,  and  he  remained  absorbed, 
sighing  again  and  again.  It  seemed  to  him  that  this  song  made 
the  past  live  once  more,  and  Shatrughna's  companions,  overcome, 
listened  to  the  enchanting  symphonic  poem  with  bowed  heads. 

Thereafter,  those  warriors  cried  out,  "  Wonderful !  "  and 
began  to  question  each  other,  saying  : — 

"  What  is  this  ?  Where  are  we  ?  Is  it  a  vision  or  a  dream  ? 
Are  we  seeing  that  marvellous  epic  in  a  dream  ?  "  In  their 
extreme  astonishment,  they  said  to  Shatrughna  : — 

"  O  Prince,  do  thou  interrogate  Valmiki,  that  foremost  of 
Sages,"  for  they  were  all  struck  with  amazement,  but  Shat- 
rughna answered  them,  saying  : — 

"  O  Ye  Soldiers,  it  is  not  fitting  to  interrogate  such  a  person. 
Many  miracles  take  place  in  this  hermitage,  nevertheless,  it  does 
not  become  us  to  question  a  great  ascetic  out  of  curiosity." 

Having  spoken  thus  to  his  troops,  the  son  of  Raghu  paid 
obeisance  to  that  illustrious  Rishi  and  entered  his  own  quarters. 


CHAPTER     72 

Shatrughna  returns  to  see  Rama 

Though  that  lion  among  men  had  laid  himself  down,  he  was 
unable  to  sleep  and  his  mind  was  absorbed  in  the  marvellous 
epic  of  Rama,  and  while  he  listened  to  those  ravishing  strains 
accompanied  by  stringed  instruments,  the  night  passed  quickly 
for  the  magnanimous  Shatrughna.  The  night  being  over,  that 
prince,  having  performed  his  morning  devotions,  with  joined 
palms  addressed  the  foremost  of  ascetics,  saying : — 

"  O  Blessed  One,  I  desire  to  behold  the  one  who  is  the  Joy 
of  the  Raghu  Race  and  crave  permission  to  take  leave  of  thee  and 
the  other  acetics  of  rigid  penances." 

Hearing  the  petition  of  Shatrughna,  the  Scourge  of  his  Foes, 
offspring  of  the  Raghu  Race,  Valmiki  embraced  him  and  granted

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

him  permission  to  depart.  Thereupon  that  prince,  having  paid 
obeisance  to  the  foremost  of  the  ascetics,  ascended  a  magnificent 
chariot  and,  in  his  eagerness  to  see  Rama,  soon  reached  Ayodhya. 
Having  entered  that  charming  city,  the  long-armed  and 
fortunate  descendant  of  the  Ikshvakus  sought  out  Rama  of  great 
renown  and  beheld  him  seated  amidst  his  counsellor  his 
countenance  as  radiant  as  the  full  moon,  and  he  resembled  the 
Thousand-eyed  God  surrounded  by  the  Immortals. 

Paying  obeisance  to  the  resplendent  and  magnanimous  Rama 
with  joined  palms,  he  addressed  that  hero,  whose  prowess  was 
truth,  saying : — 

"  O  Great  King,  all  that  thou  hast  commanded  has  been 
carried  out  by  me ;  the  wicked  Lavana  is  dead  and  his  city  is 
occupied.  Now  twelve  years  have  been  passed  far  from  thee,  O 
Joy  of  the  Raghus,  and  I  can  no  longer  live  separated  from  thee, 
O  Prince.  Be  gracious  to  me,  O  Kakutstha,  thou  whose  valour 
is  immeasurable ;  do  not  ask  me  to  remain  there  longer  like  a 
calf  separated  from  its  mother." 
As  he  spoke  thus,  Kakutstha  embraced  him  and  said  : — 
"Do  not  give  way  to  despondency,  O  Valiant  One,  such 
conduct  is  not  worthy  of  a  warrior.  Kings  do  not  withdraw  to 
foreign  lands,  O  Raghava,  the  duty  of  a  king  is  the  protection  of 
his  people.  O  Virtuous  Shatrughna,  do  thou  visit  me  from  time 
to  time  in  Ayodhya,  then  thou  must  return  to  thy  capital.  I  too 
cherish  thee  more  than  life  itself  yet  it  is  essential  to  look  to  the 
security  of  thy  kingdom.  Meantime  remain  here  with  me  for 
seven  days,  O  Kakutstha,  and  thereafter  return  to  Madhura  with 
thine  escort  of  servants  and  cavalry." 

Hearing  Rama's  words  that  were  pleasing  to  the  heart  and  in 
conformity  with  dharma,  Shatrughna  answered  sorrowfully, "  So 
be  it !  " 

Thereafter,  having  passed  a  week  in  Rama's  proximity,  that 
skilful  archer,  Shatrughna,  in  accord  with  his  brother's  will, 
made  preparations  to  depart.  Paying  obeisance  to  that  true 
hero,  the  magnanimous  Rama,  and  to  Bbarata  and  Lakshmana, 
he  ascended  his  chariot  and,  being  accompanied  for  a  great 
distance  by  Lakshmana  and  Bharata,  he  hastened  to  regain  his 
capital.

CHAPTER     73 

The  Death  of  a  Brahmin's  Son 

Having  said  farewell  to  Shatrughna,  the  fortunate  Rama  found 
satisfaction  in  ruling  his  kingdom  in  equity. 

Now  some  time  after,  an  aged  peasant,  a  brahmin,  bearing 
his  dead  child  in  his  arms  came  to  the  palace  gate,  weeping  and 
crying  out  again  and  again  : — 

"  What  sin  did  I  commit  in  a  previous  existence  ?  " 
Overcome  with  paternal  grief,  he  repeated  unceasingly,  "  O 
My  Son,  My  Son  !  Ah  !  Of  what  fault  was  I  formerly  guilty  in 
another  body  that  I  should  see  mine  only  son  meet  with  death  ? 
This  boy  had  not  yet  reached  adolescence,  his  fourteenth  year 
not  having  been  completed !  To  my  misfortune,  before  his 
time,  this  dear  child  has  been  struck  down  by  death  !  In  a  few 
days,  I  and  thy  mother  too  will  die  of  grief,  O  Dear  Child  !  I 
do  not  recollect  ever  to  have  uttered  a  he ;  I  do  not  remember 
ever  inflicting  an  injury  on  any  animal  or  doing  harm  to  any 
person  !  For  what  misdeed  has  this  child,  bom  to  me,  gone  to 
the  abode  of  Vaivaswata  this  day,  ere  he  had  performed  a  son's 
duties  to  his  sire  ?  Never  before  have  I  witnessed  or  heard  of 
such  a  dreadful  thing  as,  in  Rama's  reign,  for  people  to  die 
prematurely.  Rama  must  have  committed  a  serious  fault  since 
in  his  kingdom,  children  succumb.  Assuredly  the  young  who 
inhabit  other  countries  need  not  fear  death  !  O  King,  give  me 
back  the  life  of  my  child,  who  has  fallen  under  the  sway  of 
death  !  With  my  wife,  I  shall  yield  up  my  life  at  the  gate  of  the 
king  as  if  I  were  without  a  protector  !  Thereafter,  having  been 
guilty  of  Brahmanicide,  O  Rama,  be  happy  !  Mayest  thou  live 
long  with  thy  brothers  !  O  Mighty  Monarch,  under  thy  rule, 
after  a  period  of  prosperity  in  thine  empire,  misfortune  has  now 
overtaken  us,  placing  us  under  death's  dominion,  O  Rama ! 
From  now  on  we  shall  not  enjoy  the  least  felicity  since  the  empire 
of  the  magnanimous  Ikshvakus  no  longer  has  a  support.  With 
Rama  as  its  protector,  the  death  of  children  is  certain.  People 
perish  under  the  unrighteous  rule  of  an  impious  monarch.  The 
579 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

evil  conduct  of  a  king  brings  about  the  premature  death  of  his 
subjects.  When,  in  the  cities  and  country,  crimes  are  committed 
and  no  supervision  is  exercised,  then  death  is  to  be  feared ! 
Undoubtedly  the  king  will  be  held  to  be  at  fault  in  city  and 
country,  hence  the  death  of  this  child." 

Such  were  the  countless  recriminations  that  the  unfortunate 
father  addressed  to  the  king  whilst  he  clasped  his  son  to  his 
breast. 


CHAPTER     74 

Narada's  Discourse 

The  piteous  lamentations  of  that  unfortunate  brahmin  reached 
the  ears  of  the  king  and  he,  in  the  profound  distress  he  experi- 
enced, called  together  his  ministers,  Vasishtha  and  Vamadeva, 
with  his  brothers  and  the  elders  of  the  city  also. 

Then  eight  brahmins  were  ushered  into  the  king's  presence 
by  Vasishtha,  who  resembled  a  God,  and  they  said  : — 

"  May  prosperity  attend  thee  !  " 

Thereafter  those  foremost  of  the  Twice-born,  Markandeya, 
MaudgaJya,  Vamadeva,  Kashyapa,  Katyayana,  Javali,  Gautama 
and  Narada  took  their  seats,  and  those  Rishis  being  assembled, 
Rama  paid  obeisance  to  them  with  joined  palms.  Then  the 
ministers  and  citizens  received  a  cordial  welcome,  as  was  fitting, 
and  all  those  highly  effulgent  persons  being  seated  near  him, 
Raghava  informed  them  of  the  reproaches  of  that  Twice-born 
One. 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  prince,  who  was  filled  with  distress, 
Narada  himself  made  this  memorable  reply  in  the  assembly  of 
the  Sages : — 

"  Learn,  O  King,  what  has  caused  the  untimely  death  of  this 
child !  When  thou  art  conversant  therewith,  do  what  thou 
considerest  to  be  thy  duty  ! 

"  O  Prince,  Joy  of  the  Raghus,  formerly  in  the  Krita  Yuga, 

the  brahmins  alone  practised  asceticism ;  he  who  was  not  a 

brahmin  in  no  wise  undertook  it.    At  the  close  of  that  age,  all 

was  consumed  and  absorbed  into  Brahman.    Thereafter  the 

580 


UTTARA    KANDA 

brahmins  were  re-born  enlightened  and  endowed  with  the  gift 
of  immortality.  In  that  age,  none  died  prematurely  and  all 
were  wise. 

"  The  Treta  Yuga  followed  when  the  sons  of  Manu  were 
born,1  who  practised  austerities ;  these  noble  men  were  the 
rulers,  and  full  of  power  and  heroism.  In  that  era,  Brahmins  and 
Kshatriyas  were  equal  in  power  nor  could  any  distinction  be 
found  amongst  them ;  it  was  then  that  the  four  castes  were 
established. 

"  When  that  Yuga,  which  had  been  free  from  nescience,  was 
consumed  in  the  Fire,3  unrighteousness  placed  one  foot  on  the 
earth  and,  on  account  of  wrong-doing,  glory  waned  and  the  span 
of  life  was  diminished,  O  Best  of  Monarchs.  Flesh  that  had 
been  formerly  eaten,3  became  impure  food  throughout  the 
whole  world  and,  in  these  conditions,  men  gave  themselves  up 
to  good  deeds,  taking  refuge  in  purity  and  justice  to  rid  them- 
selves of  evil. 

"  In  the  Treta  Yuga,  brahmins  and  warriors  practised 
asceticism  and  the  rest  were  under  the  supreme  obligation  of 
obedience,  proper  to  the  Vaishya  and  Shudra  classes ;  the 
Shudras'  duty  being  to  serve  the  other  three. 

"  O  Great  King,  in  the  Dwapara  Yuga,  untruth  and  evil 
increased,  unrightousness  having  placed  a  second  foot  on  the 
earth,  and  then  the  Vaishyas  began  to  practice  penance,  so  that 
dharma,  in  the  form  of  asceticism,  was  performed  by  the  three 
castes,  but  the  Shudras  were  not  permitted  to  undertake  it  during 
that  time,  O  Foremost  of  Men. 

"  O  Prince,  a  man  of  the  lowest  caste  may  not  give  himself  up 
to  penance  in  the  Dwapara  Yuga  ;  it  is  only  in  the  Kali  Yuga 
that  the  practice  of  asceticism  is  permitted  to  the  Shudra  caste. 
During  the  Dwapara  Yuga  it  is  a  great  crime  for  one  of  Shudra 
birth  to  perform  such  practices. 

"At  this  time,  in  thine  empire,  a  rigid  penance  is  being  under- 
taken by  a  wretched  Shudra,  O  Prince,  and  this  is  the  cause  of 
the  death  of  that  child. 

"  The  practice  of  unrighteousness,  be  it  in  the  city  or  the 

1  The  Kshatriyas  or  Warrior  Class. 

*  The  Fire  of  Dissolution  that  destroys  the  worlds  at  the  end  of  a  Cycle. 

*  Men  lived  on  flesh  by  hunting  before  agriculture  was  known.

country,  brings  about  misfortune  and  the  monarch  who  does 
not  mete  out  an  immediate  punishment,  goes  to  hell,  of  this  there 
is  no  doubt. 

"An  act  of  mortification  that  is  prescribed  is  well  done  and  a 
sixth  of  the  merit  goes  to  the  king  who  rules  with  justice.  But 
how  should  he,  who  does  not  protect  his  people,  enjoy  the  sixth 
portion  ?  O  Lion  among  Men,  thou  shouldst  investigate  the 
happenings  in  thy  kingdom  and  put  down  evil  wherever  it  is 
practised,  so  righteousness  may  flourish,  man's  life  be  prolonged 
and  the  child  be  revived." 


CHAPTER     75 

Rama  makes  a  Tour  of  Inspection  of  his  Kingdom 

Hearing  the  nectar-like  words  of  Narada,  Rama  was  delighted 
and  said  to  Lakshmana  : — 

"  O  Dear  Friend,  thou  who  art  faithful  to  thy  vows,  go  and 
console  that  leading  brahmin  and  cause  the  body  of  the  child  to 
be  placed  in  a  jar  of  oil  with  precious  unguents  and  fragrant 
salves  so  that  it  is  covered  and  does  not  suffer  decomposition. 
Act  in  such  a  way  that  the  body  of  the  child  does  not  dissolve  or 
decay." 

Having  issued  this  command  to  Lakshmana,  who  was  endowed 
with  auspicious  marks,  the  highly  illustrious  Kakutstha  thought 
of  Pushpaka,  and  said  "  Come  hither !  "  Conscious  of  his  inten- 
tion, the  golden  chariot1  appeared  before  him  in  the  same  hour 
and  bowing,  said  to  him : — 

"  Behold,  I  am  here  at  thy  service,  O  Long-armed  Prince  !  " 

Listening  to  the  gracious  words  of  Pushpaka,  Rama  paid 
obeisance  to  the  great  Rishis  and  ascended  the  chariot.  Armed 
with  his  bow,  his  two  quivers  and  his  glittering  sword,  Raghava 
left  the  city  in  the  charge  of  his  two  brothers,  Saumitri  and 
Bharata,  and  thereafter  that  monarch  directed  his  course  to  the 
western  region  which  he  explored  on  every  side ;  then  he  went 
to  the  northern  region  bounded  by  the  Himalayas,  but  found  no 

1  The  golden  chariot  that  is  the  presiding  Deity  of  Pushpaka. 

582 


UTTARA    KANDA 

trace  of  evil-doing  there ;  later  the  eastern  region  was  carefully 
searched  by  him  and  that  long-armed  Prince,  from  on  high  in 
his  chariot,  beheld  people  of  pure  morals  there,  as  stainless  as  a 
mirror.  Then  he,  who  causes  felicity  to  the  great  Rishis,  ranged 
the  southern  region  and,  on  the  side  of  the  Shaivala  Mountain, 
a  vast  lake  appeared  to  him,  on  the  banks  of  which  the  blessed 
Raghava  beheld  an  ascetic  practising  an  extremely  rigorous 
penance,  his  head  hanging  downwards. 

On  this  that  Prince  born  of  Raghu  approached  the  one  who 
had  given  himself  up  to  rigorous  practices  and  said  : — 

"  Blessed  art  thou,  O  Ascetic,  who  art  faithful  to  thy  vows  ! 
From  what  caste  art  thou  sprung,  O  Thou  who  hast  grown  old 
in  mortification  and  who  art  established  in  heroism.  I  am 
interested  in  this  matter,  I,  Rama,  the  son  of  Dasaratha.  What 
purpose  hast  thou  in  view  ?  Is  it  heaven  or  some  other  object  ? 
What  boon  dost  thou  seek  by  means  of  this  hard  penance  ?  I 
wish  to  know  what  thou  desirest  in  performing  these  austerities, 
O  Ascetic.  May  prosperity  attend  thee  !  Art  thou  a  brahmin  ? 
Art  thou  an  invincible  Kshatriya  ?  Art  thou  a  Vaishya,  one  of 
the  third  caste  or  art  thou  a  Shudra  ?   Answer  me  truthfully  !  " 

Then  the  ascetic,  who  was  hanging  head  downwards,  thus 
questioned  by  Rama,  revealed  his  origin  to  that  Prince  born  of 
Dasaratha,  the  foremost  of  kings,  and  the  reason  why  he  was 
practising  penance. 


CHAPTER    76 

Shambuka  is  slain  by  Rama 

Hearing  the  words  of  Rama  of  imperishable  exploits,  that 
ascetic,  his  head  still  hanging  downwards,  answered  : — 

"  O  Rama,  I  was  born  of  a  Shudra  alliance  and  I  am  per- 
forming this  rigorous  penance  in  order  to  acquire  the  status  of  a 
God  in  this  body.  I  am  not  telling  a  lie,  O  Rama,  I  wish  to 
attain  the  Celestial  Region.  Know  that  I  am  a  Shudra  and  my 
name  is  Shambuka." 

As  he  was  yet  speaking,  Raghava,  drawing  his  brilliant  and 
stainless  sword  from  its  scabbard,  cut  off  his  head.  The  Shudra 
583 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

being  slain,  all  the  Gods  and  their  leaders  with  Agni's  followers, 
cried  out,  "  Well  done  !  Well  done!"  overwhelming  Rama  with 
praise,  and  a  rain  of  celestial  flowers  of  divine  fragrance  fell  on 
all  sides,  scattered  by  Vayu.  In  their  supreme  satisfaction,  the 
Gods  said  to  that  hero,  Rama  : — 

"  Thou  hast  protected  the  interests  of  the  Gods,  O  Highly 
Intelligent  Prince,  now  ask  a  boon,  O  Beloved  Offspring  of 
Raghu,  Destroyer  of  Thy  Foes.  By  thy  grace,  this  Shudra  will 
not  be  able  to  attain  heaven  !  ** 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  Gods,  that  hero  of  the  region  of 
truth,  with  joined  palms,  addressed  Purandara  of  a  Thousand 
Eyes,  saying : — 

"  Since  the  Gods  are  gratified  with  me,  let  the  son  of  that 
brahmin  be  resuscitated !  Accord  me  this,  the  greatest  of  all 
favours  !  It  is  on  account  of  my  negligence  that  this  child,  the 
only  son  of  that  brahmin,  has  died  before  his  time.  Give  him 
back  his  life !  May  prosperity  be  yours  !  I  have  promised  that 
I  would  restore  his  son  to  this  Twice-born,  do  not  let  my  words 
prove  false !  " 

Thus  spoke  Raghava  and  the  foremost  of  the  Celestials,  full 
of  joy,  gave  him  this  reply,  enhancing  his  felicity  : — 

"  O  Kakutstha  be  happy !  This  very  day  that  child  has 
received  new  life  and  has  been  restored  to  his  parents.  The  child 
was  resuscitated  at  the  instant  that  the  head  of  the  Shudra  fell. 
Be  happy  !  May  prosperity  attend  thee !  Now  let  us  go,  O 
Raghava,  O  Foremost  of  Monarchs,  we  desire  to  visit  Agastya's 
hermitage.  The  hour  of  consecration  is  at  hand  for  that  great 
Rishi !  O  Illustrious  Prince,  for  twelve  years,  he  has  lived  in  the 
water.  O  Kakutstha,  let  us  go  together  to  offer  felicitations  to 
that  ascetic.  Do  thou  come  and  visit  the  foremost  of  Rishis 
also  and  be  happy." 

"  Be  it  so  !  "  said  the  enhancer  of  the  Raghus'  joy  and  ascended 
the  gold-encrusted  Chariot,  Pushpaka.  Meantime,  the  Gods  had 
left  in  their  vast  chariots  and  Rama  followed  them  without 
delay  to  the  hermitage  of  Kumbhayoni. 

Beholding  those   Gods  come  to  meet  him,  the  virtuous 

Agastya,  that  treasury  of  asceticism,  paid  obeisance  to  all  without 

distinction  and,  having  received  his  homage  and  offered  saluta- 

tations  to  him,  the  Gods  joyfully  returned  to  their  abode  with 

584 


UTTARA    KANDA 

their  attendants.  When  they  had  departed,  Rama  descended  from 
the  Pushpaka  Plane  and  offered  obeisance  to  that  illustrious  Rishi. 

Agastya,  radiant  in  his  own  effulgence,  returned  the  salutation 
of  his  magnanimous  Sovereign,  who,  having  received  supreme 
hospitality,  seated  himself,  whereupon  the  illustrious  Kurab- 
hayoni  of  rigid  penances  said  to  him  : — 

"  O  Foremost  of  Men,  be  thou  welcome  !  O  Raghava,  it  is 
my  good  fortune  that  brings  thee  here !  O  Rama,  thou  art 
worthy  of  the  highest  respect  on  account  of  thine  outstanding 
and  innumerable  attributes,  O  Prince !  Thou  art  a  guest  worthy 
of  honour  and  abidest  in  mine  heart.  The  Gods  tell  me  that 
thou  hast  come  here  after  slaying  the  Shudra  and,  by  this  act  of 
justice  thou  hast  restored  the  son  of  a  brahmin  to  life !  Pass 
the  night  here  with  me,  O  Raghava,  for  thou  art  Narayana,  the 
Blessed  Lord  and  all  is  to  be  found  in  Thee !  Thou  art  the 
divine  Purusha  !  To-morrow  at  dawn  thou  canst  return  to  the 
city  in  the  Pushpaka  Chariot. 

"  O  My  Friend,  here  is  an  ornament  wrought  by  Vishvakarma, 
which  is  of  divine  origin  and  glows  by  its  own  light.  Be  pleased 
to  accept  it,  O  Kakutstha.  To  give  again  what  one  has  received 
is  said  to  be  of  the  greatest  profit.  Thou  art  worthy  of  this 
ornament  and  also  of  the  highest  rewards  since  thou  hast 
protected  the  Gods  and  their  leaders.  I  have  therefore  a  right 
to  offer  this  to  thee,  do  thou  accept  it,  O  Prince." 

note: 

the  following  fourteen  verses  are  considered  to  be 
interpolations. 

Then  that  great  warrior  of  the  Ikshvakus,  pondering  on  the 
duties  of  the  Kshatriyas,  answered  that  magnanimous  ascetic, 
saying: — 

"  O  Illustrious  Rishi,  only  brahmins  may  accept  gifts,  it  is 
censurable  for  a  Kshatriya  to  do  so.  It  is  not  fitting  for  a 
Kshatriya  to  accept  a  gift  from  a  brahmin.  Do  thou  tell  me 
therefore  how  I  may  do  so  ?  " 

On  this,  the  Rishi  Agastya  replied,  saying  : — 

"  O  Rama,  O  Son  of  Dasaratha,  at  the  beginning  of  the  Golden 
Age,  the  human  race  had  no  king,  only  the  Celestials  had  Vasava 
585 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

as  their  ruler.  To  obtain  a  king,  therefore,  men  approached 
Brahma,  the  God  of  Gods  and  said : — 

"  *  O  Lord,  thou  hast  made  Indra  ruler  over  the  Celestials, 
therefore  do  thou  confer  a  sovereign  upon  us  who  shall  be  the 
foremost  of  men  ;  we  cannot  live  without  a  king,  this  is  our  firm 
conviction  •  * 

"  Then  the  Grandsire  of  the  World  sent  for  Indra  and  the 
other  Gods  and  said  : — 

"  '  Do  ye  all  sacrifice  a  portion  of  your  welfare !  *  and  the 
Celestials  surrendered  part  of  their  power  and  a  king  was  born, 
whereupon  Brahma  named  him  Kshupa.1  In  his  person, 
Brahma  placed  an  equal  proportion  of  the  powers  of  the  Gods 
and  appointed  him  as  ruler  of  men.  By  virtue  of  the  portion  of 
Indra's  energy,  the  King  Kshupa  brought  the  earth  under  his 
control ;  by  the  portion  of  Varuna's  energy,  he  fostered  health 
in  his  body  ;  by  the  power  of  Yama,  he  ruled  the  people.  O 
Rama,  by  virtue  of  Indra's  portion,  thou  art  the  Ruler  of  the 
earth,  do  thou  accept  this  jewel  and  confer  thy  grace  on  me." 

Hearing  the  words  of  the  Sage,  Rama  accepted  the  brilliant 
and  celestial  gem  sparkling  like  the  rays  of  the  sun  and,  having 
taken  that  excellent  ornament,  Dasarathi  enquired  of  the  great 
Sage  Kumbhayoni,  saying : — 

"  Whence  hast  thou  obtained  this  divine  ornament  of  celestial 
workmanship  ?  Who  has  given  it  to  thee ,  O  Brahmin,  I  ask 
thee  out  of  curiosity ,    Thou  art  an  ocean  of  marvels  !  " 

Then  Agastya  answered  : — 

"  Hear,  O  Rama,  how  I  obtained  this  ornament  in  the  Treta- 
Yuga."

The  Story  of  Swargin 

"  O  RAMA,  formerly  in  the  Treta-Yuga,  there  was  a  vast  wilder- 
ness some  four  hundred  miles  in  extent  where  there  was  neither 
beast  nor  bird  and  there  I  was  undergoing  a  rigid  penance.  O 
My  Friend,  I  began  to  range  that  uninhabited  solitude !  I 
cannot  describe  its  beauty  with  the  fruits,  roots  of  exquisite 
savour  and  the  trees  of  varying  essences.

**  In  the  centre  was  a  lake  some  four  miles  in  extent,  abounding 
in  swans  and  waterfowl,  Chakravakra  birds  being  its  ornament. 
It  was  covered  with  lotuses  and  water-lilies,  no  weed  or  moss 
grew  there  and  its  waters  were  deep,  tranquil  and  sweet.  Near 
that  wonderful  lake,  I  found  a  spacious  hermitage  which  was  of 
great  antiquity  and  devoid  of  man  or  beast.  It  was  there  I  spent 
a  summer  night,  O  Foremost  of  Men.  At  dawn,  I  rose  to  per- 
form my  morning  devotions  and  directed  my  steps  to  the  lake. 
There  I  beheld  a  dead  body,  plump  and  spotless,  shining  in 
splendour  in  the  water.  This  sight  caused  me  to  reflect  awhile, 
O  Raghava,  and  I  stood  on  the  banks  of  the  lake  asking  myself, 
*  What  can  this  be  ?  ' 

"  O  Lord,  a  moment  later  a  wonderful  celestial  chariot  came 
into  view,  which  was  magnificent,  and  harnessed  to  swans  that 
were  as  swift  as  thought.  In  that  chariot  I  beheld  a  man  of 
extraordinary  beauty,  O  Joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu,  who  was 
surrounded  by  thousands  of  Apsaras  adorned  with  celestial 
ornaments.  Some  were  singing  enchantingly  whilst  others 
played  on  musical  instruments  such  as  Mridangas,  Vinas  and 
Panavas ;  some  were  dancing  and  some,  with  the  aid  of  Chan- 
waras  gleaming  like  the  moon's  rays,  possessing  ornate  handles, 
were  fanning  the  face  of  that  lotus-eyed  youth.  Then  he,  who 
was  as  radiant  as  the  peak  of  Mount  Meru,  leaving  his  seat, 
descended  from  the  chariot  and,  under  my  gaze,  devoured  that 
corpse.  Having  satisfied  his  hunger  with  abundant  flesh,  he 
plunged  into  the  waters  and  after  washing  his  hands  and  rinsing 
his  mouth  according  to  tradition,  he  re-ascended  his  chariot. 

"  Beholding  that  heavenly  being  about  to  depart,  I  spoke  to 
him  thus,  O  Prince : — 

"  *  Who  art  thou  who  resemblest  a  God  ?  Why  hast  thou 
partaken  of  this  forbidden  flesh,  O  My  Friend  ?  Tell  me  how 
does  this  loathsome  nourishment  benefit  thee,  O  Thou  who  art 
the  equal  of  the  Celestials  ?  There  is  some  mystery  in  this,  O 
Friend,  I  wish  to  know  what  it  is ;  I  cannot  believe  a  corpse  to 
be  fitting  food  for  thee.' 

"  Thus,  out  of  curiosity,  in  friendly  accents,  did  I  speak  to 
that  Nakin,1  O  Prince  and  having  listened  to  me,  he  told  me  all."

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     78 

Shveta  tells  his  Story 

"  Having  listened  to  these  auspicious  words,  that  Celestial 
Being,  with  joined  palms  answered  me  in  this  wise,  O  Rama, 
Joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu. 

"  *  Hear,  O  Brahmin,  of  what  happened  to  me  formerly, 
bringing  about  my  felicity  and  also  my  suffering.  Learn  of  the 
inexorable  fate  about  which  thou  hast  questioned  me. 

"  *  In  times  gone  by,  my  illustrious  Sire,  the  mighty  Sudeva 
reigned  over  the  Vidarbhas.  He  had  two  sons  by  his  two  queens, 
O  Brahmin,  I  was  named  Shveta  and  my  younger  brother  Suratha . 
My  father  having  ascended  to  heaven,  I  was  installed  as  king  by 
the  people,  and  accordingly  applied  myself  to  rule  with  equity. 

"  'A  thousand  years  passed  whilst  I  governed  the  empire 
piously  and  protected  my  people  according  to  dharma.  Knowing 
by  certain  indications  that  I  was  ageing,  O  Foremost  of  the 
Twice-born,  I  reflected  on  the  laws  of  time  and  went  to  the 
forest.  There  I  penetrated  into  an  inaccessible  grove,  where 
there  were  neither  beasts  nor  birds,  in  order  to  practise  penance 
on  the  banks  of  this  beautiful  lake,  having  first  placed  my  brother 
Suratha  on  the  throne  as  lord  of  the  empire. 

"  *  Near  this  lake,  I  gave  myself  up  to  severe  mortifications 
and  practised  austerities  for  thousands  of  years  in  the  great  forest. 
This  excessively  rigid  penance  caused  me  to  attain  Brahmaloka, 
which  nothing  transcends.  Having  ascended  to  heaven,  extreme 
hunger  and  thirst  assailed  me,  O  Foremost  of  the  Twice-born, 
whereupon,  my  mind  troubled,  I  approached  the  Lord  of  the 
Three  Worlds,  the  Grandsire,  and  said  to  him  : — 

"  ' "  O  Blessed  One,  in  Brahmaloka  one  should  not  be  subject 
to  hunger  and  thirst  j  from  what  act  of  mine  does  this  desire 
to  eat  and  drink,  spring  ?  What  should  be  my  food,  tell  me,  O 
Divine  Grandsire  ?  " 

M  *  Then  the  Grandsire  answered  me,  saying ; — 

w  * "  O  Son  of  Sudeva,  thine  own  flesh  shall  be  thy  savoury 
nourishment  and  thou  shalt  feed  on  it  daily.  Thou  didst  ever 
nourish  thy  body  well  when  thou  wast  performing  an  excellent 
588 


UTTARA    KANDA 

penance.  That  which  is  sowed  ever  flourishes,  O  Virtuous 
Shveta.  Without  making  any  gifts,  thou  didst  practise  asceti- 
cism ;  it  is  on  this  account  that  thou  art  subject  to  hunger  and 
thirst  in  heaven,  which  thou  hast  attained.  Therefore,  thine 
own  body  that  has  been  well  nourished  shall  be  thy  food  in 
heaven,  and  it  shall  be  converted  into  Amrita,  but  when  the  great 
and  invincible  Rishi  Agastya  comes  to  the  forest,  he  will  deliver 
thee  from  this  bondage,  O  Shveta  !  My  Friend,  he  can  save  the 
hosts  of  the  Gods  themselves,  how  much  more  is  he  able  to  save 
thee  from  the  domination  of  hunger  and  thirst  to  which  thou  art 
subjected,  O  Long-armed  Hero." 

"  '  O  Lord  of  the  Twice-born,  since  the  decree  of  Bhagawat, 
that  Lord  of  Lords,  I  have  been  nourishing  myself  miserably  on 
mine  own  body !  For  innumerable  years  I  nave  fed  upon  it 
without  it  diminishing,  O  Brahmarishi,  and  my  appetite  is 
excessive.  Do  thou  deliver  me  from  this  painful  pass  ;  release 
will  not  come  to  me  from  any  other  than  the  Ascetic  Kumb- 
hayoni !  O  Dear  and  Excellent  Sage,  do  thou  accept  this  gift, 
may  good  betide  thee,  accord  me  this  favour !  I  will  bestow 
gold,  possessions,  raiment,  savoury  food  and  much  else 
besides,  as  also  ornaments  on  thee,  O  Foremost  of  Sages,  I 
offer  thee  all  that  is  desirable  and  all  felicity,  as  the  price  of  my 
deliverance,  O  Grant  me  that  grace ! ' 

"  Hearing  these  words  of  that  unfortunate  Celestial  Being,  I 
accepted  the  rare  jewel  in  order  to  save  him  and,  as  soon  as  I 
received  that  magnificent  gem,  the  mortal  body  of  that  Royal- 
Rishi  melted  away.  His  body  being  thus  dissolved,  that 
Rajarishi  experienced  supreme  satisfaction  and  joyfully  ascended 
to  Swarga.  This  is  why  that  Celestial  Being,  who  resembled 
Shakra,  gave  that  divine  gem,  wonderful  to  look  upon,  to  me,  O 
Kakutstha." 

chapter    79 

The  hundred  Sons  of  Ikshvaku 

Having  heard  Agastya's  marvellous  story,  Raghava,  full  of 
reverence  and  admiration,  began  to  question  him,  saying : — 
"  O  Blessed  One,  why  are  there  no  wild  beasts  or  birds  in  this 
589 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

forest  where  the  King  of  Vidarbha,  Shveta,  used  to  practise  that 
rigid  penance  ?  Why  did  that  prince  enter  this  deserted  and 
uninhabited  wood  in  order  to  give  himself  up  to  the  performance 
of  asceticism ;  I  wish  to  know  all  in  detail  ?  " 

Hearing  this  question  inspired  by  curiosity,  that  foremost  of 
ascetics  began  to  speak  thus  : — 

"  In  ancient  times  in  the  golden  age,  O  Rama,  the  Lord 
Manu  was  the  ruler  of  the  earth.  His  son  was  Ikshvaku,  the 
enhancer  of  the  felicity  of  his  race.  Having  placed  his  eldest 
son,  the  invincible  Ikshvaku  on  the  throne,  Manu  said  : — 

" '  Become  the  founder  of  royal  dynasties  in  the  world  ! ' 

"  O  Rama,  Ikshvaku  promised  to  follow  his  injunctions  and 
Manu,  gready  delighted,  added  : — 

" '  I  am  pleased  with  thee,  O  Noble  One,  undoubtedly  thou 
shalt  found  a  dynasty  but,  whilst  ruling  thy  subjects  with  firm- 
ness, never  punish  any  who  is  without  fault !  A  punishment 
meted  out  to  the  guilty  according  to  the  law  is  instrumental  in 
conducting  a  monarch  to  heaven,  therefore,  O  Long-armed  Hero, 
O  Dear  Child,  exercise  extreme  care  in  wielding  the  sceptre, 
this  is  thy  supreme  duty  on  earth.' 

"  Having  counselled  his  son  repeatedly  in  this  wise,  Manu 
joyfully  repaired  to  the  eternal  abode  of  Brahma. 

"  His  Sire  having  ascended  to  the  Celestial  Region,  Ikshvaku 
of  immeasurable  glory  reflected  anxiously  within  himself  as  to 
how  he  should  create  progeny.  Having  performed  many 
sacrifices  and  charitable  deeds,  he  was  blessed  with  a  hundred 
sons  like  unto  the  offspring  of  the  Gods.  The  youngest  of  all,  O 
Descendant  of  Raghu,  was  stupid  and  ignorant  nor  would  he 
listen  to  the  advice  of  his  elders.  On  account  of  his  lack  of 
virtue,  the  king  named  him  Danda,  thinking  that  the  rod 
(Danda)  would  inevitably  fall  on  him. 

"As  the  monarch  was  unable  to  find  a  province  suitable  for 
his  son,  O  Raghava,  Conqueror  of  Thy  Foes,  he  carved  out  a 
territory  for  him  between  the  Vindhya  and  Shaivala  Mountains. 
Danda  became  king  and  there  built  an  incomparably  beautiful 
city  on  that  charming  site  surrounded  by  mountains.  He  named 
that  city  Madhumanta,  O  Lord,  and  chose  Shukra  Deva  of  pious 
practices  as  his  spiritual  preceptor.  Danda  with  his  Guru  ruled 
over  that  city  inhabited  by  happy  people  as  the  King  of  the  Gods 
59o 


UTTARA    KANDA 

in  heaven.    That  monarch,  the  son  of  the  foremost  of  men,  with 
the  help  of  Shukra  Deva  ruled  as  the  great  and  magnanimous 

Shakra  in  heaven  under  the  guidance  of  Brihaspali." 


CHAPTER     80 

Danda  insults  Aruja 

Having  related  that  story  to  Rama,  the  great  ascetic,  born  from 
a  jar,  continued  : — 

**  Danda,  O  Kakutstha,  fully  self-controlled,  continued  to 
rule  for  innumerable  years,  overcoming  all  obstacles.  One  day, 
in  the  delicious  month  of  Chaitra,  the  king  went  to  the  ravishing 
hermitage  of  Bhargava  and  he  beheld  the  daughter  of  that 
ascetic,  who  was  walking  in  the  woodland  glade,  and  she  was 
unrivalled  in  beauty  on  earth  so  that  he  was  seized  with  desire. 
Pierced  by  the  darts  of  the  God  of  Love,  he  approached  that 
youthful  maiden  and  enquired  of  her,  saying  : — 

"  '  From  whence  art  thou,  O  Lady  of  graceful  hips  ?  Who 
is  thy  father,  O  Beautiful  One  ?  Being  afflicted  with  passion,  I 
make  these  enquiries  of  thee,  O  Fair  Lady  ?  ' 

"  Thus  did  he  speak  in  his  agitation  and  the  daughter  of  the 
ascetic  answered  sweetly : — 

"  '  I  am  the  eldest  daughter  of  Shukracharya  of  imperishable 
deeds,  know  that  my  name  is  Aruja,  O  Foremost  of  Kings,  and 
I  dwell  in  this  hermitage.  Do  not  force  thine  attentions  upon 
me,  O  King,  for  I  am  a  girl  still  under  my  father's  authority.  My 
Sire  is  thy  Guru,  O  Great  Prince,  thou  art  the  disciple  of  that 
magnanimous  ascetic ;  that  great  Sage  will  inflict  a  terrible 
punishment  on  thee  in  his  wrath.  It  is  for  thee  to  act  honestly 
regarding  me,  in  accord  with  the  law  of  dharma,  O  Prince.  Do 
thou  first  approach  my  father  and  ask  for  my  hand  or  fearful 
consequences  will  follow  thine  act.  In  his  wrath,  my  father  will 
consume  the  Three  Worlds  themselves,  O  Thou  of  faultless 
form ;  if,  however,  thou  ask  for  my  hand,  he  will  bestow  it  on  thee.  * 

"  Thus  spoke  Aruja,  but  Danda,  who  had  fallen  under  the 
sway  of  desire,  with  joined  palms,  answered  her  in  his  frenzy, 
saying : — 

59i 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"  '  Grant  me  thy  favours,  O  Charming  One,  do  not  delay, 
on  thine  account  my  breath  is  being  extinguished,  O  Thou  of 
lovely  countenance.  Having  united  myself  with  thee,  what  care 
I  if  death  or  the  most  terrible  retribution  follow  ?  Respond  to 
my  love,  O  Timid  One,  that  love  that  overwhelms  me.' 

"  Speaking  thus,  he  seized  that  youthful  woman  roughly  in 
his  powerful  arms  and  sated  his  lust  on  her.  Having  committed 
this  monstrous  outrage,  Danda  returned  to  the  unrivalled  city  of 
Madhumanta  with  all  speed.  Aruja  however,  sobbing  near  the 
hermitage,  terrified,  awaited  her  father  who  resembled  a  God." 


CHAPTER     8  I 

The  Destruction  of  Danda' s  Kingdom 

"  Having  heard  what  had  taken  place,  the  blessed  and 
illustrious  Rishi,  surrounded  by  his  disciples,  returned  to  the 
hermitage,  tormented  with  hunger.  Like  unto  the  moon  that 
has  been  devoured  by  the  planet  Rahu  at  dawn  and  is  deprived 
of  its  radiance,  he  beheld  the  unfortunate  Aruja  besmeared  with 
dust ;  and  that  brahmin,  being  already  consumed  with  hunger, 
fell  into  a  transport  of  rage,  so  that  it  seemed  he  wished  to  destroy 
the  Three  Worlds.  Thereafter  he  addressed  his  disciples, 
saying : — 

"  '  Witness  the  terrible  calamity  born  of  my  wrath,  like  unto 
fire,  that  will  befall  that  evil-doer,  Danda  !  The  time  has  come 
for  the  destruction  of  that  wretched  monarch  and  his  court,  he, 
who  has  dared  to  place  his  hand  in  the  flame  of  the  sacrificial 
fire,  will  soon  reap  the  fruit  of  bis  evil  act !  In  seven  nights,  he 
will  perish  with  his  children,  infantry  and  cavalry.  Pakashana1 
will  destroy  the  territory  of  that  wretch  with  a  rain  of  dust  for  a 
distance  of  a  hundred  leagues  in  extent.  In  the  kingdom  of 
Danda,  in  seven  days,  all  things  animate  and  inanimate  will 
perish  utterly  and  everything  that  grows  will  vanish  entirely 
under  the  rain  of  ashes  !  * 

"  Having  spoken  thus  to  the  inhabitants  of  the  hermitage,  his 
eyes  red  with  anger,  he  added  : —

UTTARA    KANDA 

"  '  Take  up  your  abode  beyond  the  confines  of  this  region  !  * 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  Shukracharya,  all  those  who  dwelt  in 
the  hermitage,  left  that  place  to  establish  themselves  elsewhere, 
and  Shukracharya,  having  spoken  thus  to  that  company  of 
Sages,  addressed  his  daughter  Aruja  and  said  : — 

"  '  Remain  in  this  hermitage,  O  Foolish  One,  and  give  thyself 
up  to  meditation.  O  Aruja,  awaiting  the  time  of  thy  deliverance, 
enjoy  carefree  this  lake  of  enchanting  aspect  four  miles  in  extent ! 
Those  creatures  that  take  refuge  with  thee  at  that  time  will  in 
no  wise  suffer  from  the  rain  of  dust ! ' 

"At  the  command  of  the  Brahmarishi,  her  Sire,  Aruja,  who 
was  overcome  with  grief,  answered ; '  So  be  it ! ' 

"  Having  spoken  thus,  Shukracharya  found  a  dwelling  else- 
where. 

"  Meantime  the  kingdom  of  that  foremost  of  men  with  his 
servants,  his  army  and  his  chariots  was  reduced  to  ashes  on  the 
seventh  day,  as  predicted  by  that  interpreter  of  the  Veda.  O 
Prince,  that  empire  situated  between  the  Vindhya  and  the 
Shaivala  Mountains,  its  sovereign  having  ceased  to  uphold 
dharma,  thus  cursed  by  the  Brahmarishi,  has  since  been  known 
as  the  Desert  of  Dandaka,  O  Kakutstha,  and  the  place  where  the 
ascetics  dwelt  became  known  as  Janasthana.  I  have  now  replied 
fully  to  all  that  thou  hast  asked,  O  Raghava.  The  hour  for  the 
evening  devotions  is  passing,  O  Hero;  from  all  directions,  the 
great  Rishis  with  their  loshtas  filled,  having  bathed,  O  Prince, 
are  now  worshipping  the  Sun-god.  The  sun  has  withdrawn 
behind  the  Astachala  Mountains  while  these  learned  interpreters 
of  the  Veda  were  reading  the  Brahmanas  together ;  do  thou 
also  perform  thine  ablutions,  O  Rama." 


chapter   82 

Rama  takes  leave  of  Agastya 

Following  the  behest  of  the  Rishi,  Rama,  in  order  to  perform 

his  evening  devotions,  approached  the  sacred  lake  frequented  by 

troops  of  Apsaras.    Having  completed  his  ablutions  and  the 

593 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

evening  rites,  he  returned  to  the  hermitage  of  the  magnanimous 
Kumbhayoni.  Thereupon  Agastya,  for  his  repast,  prepared 
many  kinds  of  fruits  and  roots  with  rice  and  pure  ingredients, 
and  the  foremost  of  men  partook  of  that  food  resembling  Amrita 
and  passed  the  night  there  happily. 

At  dawn,  that  Subduer  of  His  Foes,  the  Prince  of  the  Raghus, 
having  performed  the  morning  rituals,  approached  the  Sage 
before  his  departure  and,  paying  obeisance  to  that  great  ascetic, 
born  from  a  jar,  said  to  him : — 

"  Suffer  me  to  return  to  this  retreat,  I  beg  of  thee  !  Happy 
am  I  to  have  received  the  favour  of  looking  on  such  a  great 
ascetic  whom  I  shall  visit  again  for  my  sanctification  !  " 

Listening  to  the  words  of  Kakutstha,  wonderful  to  hear,  he, 
whose  vision  was  righteousness,  in  great  delight,  answered  : — 

"  O  Rama,  O  Joy  of  the  Raghus,  thy  speech,  brilliantly 
expressed,  is  of  great  eloquence.  Thou  thyself  art  the  sanctity 
of  all  beings  !  O  Rama,  whoever  casts  a  single  glance  of  love  on 
thee  is  purified ;  he  goes  to  paradise  where  he  receives  the 
homage  of  the  Lords  of  the  Third  Heaven ;  but  those  who  look 
on  thee  with  a  malevolent  eye  are  suddenly  struck  down  by  the 
Rod  of  Death  and  fall  into  hell .'  O  Prince,  Issue  of  the  Raghu 
Race,  thou  art  the  salvation  of  all  beings  on  earth  and  those  who 
even  speak  of  thee  acquire  perfection.  Do  thou  go  in  peace ! 
Govern  thine  empire  with  equity ;  thou  art  the  path  of  the 
world ! " 

Thus  did  that  Muni  speak  and  the  virtuous  prince  with  joined 
palms,  paid  obeisance  to  that  ascetic  and,  having  offered  saluta- 
tions to  that  foremost  of  Sages  and  the  other  Munis,  tranquilly 
ascended  the  golden  Pushpaka  Chariot.  As  he  was  leaving,  the 
companies  of  Sages  showered  blessings  of  every  kind  upon  him, 
he  who  was  equal  to  Mahendra,  as  the  Devas  acclaim  that  God 
of  a  Thousand  Eyes. 

Standing  in  space,  Rama,  in  his  golden  Chariot  Pushpaka, 
resembled  the  moon  encircled  with  clouds.  Thereafter,  at  noon, 
Kakutstha  entered  Ayodhya  amidst  continuous  acclamations 
and,  having  reached  the  central  court,  he  dismounted  from  the 
car.  When  the  prince  left  Pushpaka,  that  magnificent  chariot, 
which  coursed  wheresoever  one  willed,  dismissing  it,  he  said : — 
"  Go,  may  good  betide  thee !  "

Thereafter  Rama  issued  this  command  to  the  doorkeeper  who 
was  in  the  courtyard  and  said : — 

"  Go  and  announce  mine  arrival  to  Lakshmana  and  Bharata, 
those  two  swift-footed  heroes,  and  summon  them  here  without 
delay." 


CHAPTER     83 

Bharata  persuades  Rama  not  to  perform  the  Rajasuya  Sacrifice 

At  this  command  from  Rama  of  imperishable  exploits,  the  guard 
summoned  those  two  youthful  princes  and  came  back  to  inform 
his  master.  Then  he,  seeing  Bharata  and  Lakshmana,  embraced 
them  both  and  said  to  them  : — 

"  I  have  faithfully  carried  out  the  task  of  the  excellent  Twice- 
born,  now  I  wish  to  perform  the  Rajasuya  Sacrifice,  which  to 
my  mind  is  indestructible  and  unchangeable,  the  support  of  the 
law  and  the  destroyer  of  all  evil.  Accompanied  by  you  both,  who 
are  parts  of  myself,  I  wish  to  prepare  for  this  sacrifice  based  on 
eternal  dharma,  for  it  is  an  unwritten  duty.  It  was  after  per- 
forming the  Rajasuya  Sacrifice  that  Mitra,  the  Scourge  of  His 
Foes,  obtained  Varuna-hood  by  means  of  this  rich  offering. 
Having  celebrated  that  sacrifice  according  to  the  tradition  which 
was  well-known  to  him,  Soma  acquired  an  imperishable  state 
and  renown  in  the  world.  Do  you  therefore  tell  me  what  is 
now  best,  and  considering  the  matter  with  me,  say  candidly 
what  is  of  the  greatest  profit  for  the  future." 

Thus  spoke  Raghava,  and  Bharata,  a  skilful  debator,  with 
joined  palms  made  answer,  saying  : — 

"  O  Dear  Brother,  in  thee  the  highest  sense  of  duty  is  to  be 
found !  It  is  in  thee  that  the  world  finds  her  support ;  in  thee, 
all  glory  resides,  and  also  immeasurable  valour,  O  Long-armed 
Hero.  All  the  kings  of  the  earth,  and  we  too,  regard  thee  as  the 
protector  of  the  universe,  as  do  the  Gods  and  Prajapati.  Children 
look  on  thee  as  their  father,  O  Valiant  Prince,  thou  hast  become 
the  salvation  of  living  beings  also,  O  Raghava ;  how  shouldst 
thou  perform  a  sacrifice  of  such  a  nature,  O  Lord,  in  which  the 
destruction  of  many  royal  Houses  is  involved  ?  Further  O  King, 
595 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

it  means  the  total  annihilation  of  those  warriors  who  have 
become  the  heroes  of  the  earth,  which  will  prove  a  cause  of 
universal  condemnation.  O  Lion  among  Warriors,  O  Thou 
whose  virtues  render  thee  unequalled  in  power,  do  not  destroy 
the  world  that  is  wholly  subject  to  thee." 

When  Rama  heard  Bharata  speak  thus,  in  words  sweet  as 
nectar,  he  experienced  an  extreme  delight  and  addressed  this 
benign  response  to  the  enhancer  of  Kaikeyi's  joy,  saying : — 

"  I  am  happy  and  delighted  with  what  thou  hast  said,  O 
Irreproachable  Hero,  this  resolute  discourse,  in  accord  with 
righteousness,  that  thou  hast  uttered,  O  Lion  among  Heroes, 
has  preserved  the  earth !  The  resolve  I  made  to  proceed  with 
the  great  Rajasuya  Sacrifice,  I  now  renounce  on  thine  excellent 
counsel,  O  Virtuous  Bharata.  The  wise  should  never  commit 
any  act  detrimental  to  the  world.  Contrariwise  one  should  be 
willing  to  receive  good  advice  even  from  a  child,  O  Thou,  the 
elder  brother  of  Lakshmana ;  I  am  pleased  with  thy  counsel 
which  is  wise  and  considered,  O  Valiant  Prince  !  " 


chapter   84 

The  Story  of  Vritra 

Thus  spoke  Rama  to  the  great-souled  Bharata,  and  thereafter 
Lakshmana  addressed  this  eloquent  discourse  to  the  One  who 
enhanced  the  felicity  of  the  Raghus,  saying : — 

"  The  great  Sacrifice  Ashwamedha  removes  all  sins  and  is  the 
infallible  means  of  purification ;  may  it  please  thee  to  undertake 
it,  O  Joy  of  the  Raghus  ! 

"  It  is  said  in  the  Puranas  that  the  magnanimous  Vasava, 
sullied  by  the  sin  of  brahmanicide,  was  cleansed  by  performing 
the  Horse-sacrifice.  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  in  former  times 
when  Devas  and  Asuras  were  united,  there  lived  a  universally 
honoured  Daitya  named  Vritra.  The  width  of  his  body  was  an 
hundred  leagues  and  he  was  three  times  as  tall.  In  his  loving- 
kindness,  he  cast  his  beneficent  glance  in  all  directions  on  the 
Three  Worlds.  Loyal,  grateful,  highly  intelligent,  he  ruled  his 
fertile  territory  with  care  and  integrity  and,  under  his  dominion, 
596 


UTTARA    KANDA 

the  earth  produced  all  that  could  be  desired — flowers,  roots  and 
delicious  fruits.  Without  being  cultivated  the  earth  was  abun- 
dantly fruitful  and  for  many  years  that  magnanimous  prince 
enjoyed  a  rich  empire  marvellous  to  behold.  Then  the  thought 
came  to  him :  *  I  shall  perform  a  rigid  penance ;  in  truth, 
asceticism  is  a  great  joy,  all  other  happiness  is  a  mere  illusion.' 

"  Having  established  his  eldest  son  over  his  people  as  King  of 
Madhura,  he  gave  himself  up  to  a  rigid  penance  that  caused 
terror  among  the  Gods.  As  Vritra  was  mortifying  himself  thus, 
Vasava,  in  his  extreme  affliction,  sought  out  Vishnu  and  spoke 
to  him  as  follows  : — 

"  '  On  account  of  his  asceticism  that  long-armed  hero,  Vritra, 
has  conquered  the  worlds ;  he  is  powerful  and  virtuous ;  I  shall 
not  be  able  to  overcome  him.  If  he  continues  with  these 
austerities,  O  Chief  of  the  Gods,  we  shall  be  subject  to  him  as 
long  as  the  worlds  endure.  Thou  hast  overlooked  the  extremely 
illustrious  Vritra  or  he  would  not  live  an  instant  in  the  face  of 
thy  wrath,  O  Lord  of  the  Gods.  From  the  moment  he  succeeded 
in  propitiating  thee,  O  Vishnu,  he  has  taken  over  the  direction 
of  the  worlds.  It  is  for  thee  in  thy  great  solicitude  to  befriend 
the  universe,  then  by  thy  favour,  the  worlds  will  live  in  peace, 
free  from  affliction.  All  the  inhabitants  of  the  celestial  region 
have  fixed  their  gaze  on  thee,  O  Vishnu.  Slay  Vritra  and  by  this 
great  feat  deliver  them !  Thou  hast  ever  lent  support  to  the 
magnanimous  Gods  which  cannot  be  withstood  by  their 
adversaries ;  be  the  refuge  of  those  who  have  no  other  refuge !  * " 


CHAPTER     85 

The  Death  of  Vritra 

Hearing  Lakshmana  speak  thus,  Rama,  the  Slayer  of  His  Foes, 
said  to  him : — "  O  Thou  faithful  to  thy  duty,  do  thou  relate  the 
rest  of  the  history  of  Vritra's  destruction  !  " 

At  these  words  of  Raghava's,  the  virtuous  Lakshmana, 
increaser  of  Sumitra's  delight,  continued  his  exalted  theme, 
saying : — 

"  Such  was  the  entreaty  addressed  by  all  the  inhabitants  of 

aft  597 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

heaven  led  by  that  Lord  of  a  Thousand  Eyes,  to  Vishnu,  who 
answered  all  those  Gods  with  Indra  at  their  head,  saying  : — 

"  'An  ancient  tie  binds  me  to  the  magnanimous  Vritra,  there- 
fore I  am  unable  to  favour  you  by  slaying  that  great  Asura  ;  it 
is  not  possible  for  me  to  grant  you  that  supreme  felicity  but  I 
will  indicate  the  means  whereby  the  Thousand-eyed  God  may 
destroy  him.  I  shall  divide  my  natural  essence  into  three  parts, 
O  Foremost  of  the  Gods,  and  by  these  means,  that  God  of  a 
Thousand  Eyes  can  undoubtedly  slay  Vritra.  A  third  of  my 
being  will  enter  Vasava,  a  second  part  into  the  thunderbolt  and  a 
third  will  enter  the  bosom  of  the  earth,  thus  Vritra  will  perish  ! ' 
"  Thus  spoke  the  Lord  of  the  Gods,  and  the  Deities  answered 
him  saying : — 

"  '  O  Slayer  of  Daityas,  assuredly  what  Thou  hast  uttered  will 
come  to  pass !  May  victory  be  Thine,  we  shall  now  take  our 
leave  infused  by  Thy  power  in  order  to  slay  the  Asura  Vritra,  O 
Lord ! ' 

**  Then  all  the  magnanimous  Gods  with  Sahasraksha  at  their 
head  went  to  the  great  Asura  Vritra's  retreat.  There  they  beheld 
the  most  powerful  of  Asuras,  effulgent  in  his  own  radiance 
that  seemed  to  consume  die  worlds  and  space  itself.  Beholding 
the  foremost  of  the  Asuras,  the  Gods  were  seized  with  terror  and 
reflected, '  How  shall  we  kill  him  ? ' '  How  may  we  avoid  defeat ! ' 
"As  they  were  thinking  thus,  Sahasraksha,  the  Destroyer  of 
Cities,  taking  the  thunderbolt  in  his  hands,  hurled  it  at  Vritra, 
striking  his  head.  Like  unto  the  Fire  of  Time,  formidable, 
blazing  with  its  wreath  of  flame,  that  thunderbolt  tailing  on 
Vritra's  head  caused  terror  to  all  the  worlds. 

"  Then  the  extremely  illustrious  King  of  the  Gods,  reflecting 
on  the  iniquity  he  had  perpetrated  in  slaying  his  enemy,  fled  in 
all  haste  to  the  ends  of  the  world ;  and  the  sin  of  brahmanicide 
pursued  him  in  his  flight  and  entered  into  him,  so  that  Indra  was 
subject  to  great  affliction. 

"  The  enemy  destroyed,  but  deprived  of  their  leader,  the 
Gods  with  Agni  at  their  head,  lavished  homage  on  Vishnu,  Lord 
of  the  Three  Worlds,  saying : — 

"  *  Thou  art  the  way,  O  Supreme  Master,  the  First-born, 
Father  of  the  Universe !    For  the  protection  of  the  world  thou 
hast  assumed  the  form  of  Vishnu.    By  thy  favour,  Vritra  is 
598 


UTTARA    KANDA 

slain,  but  the  sin  of  brahmanicide  holds  Vasava  in  bondage,  do 
thou  liberate  him  ! ' 

"  Then  Vishnu  answered  the  Gods  who  had  spoken  thus  and 
said: — 

" '  Let  Shakra,  he  who  bears  the  thunderbolt,  perform  a 
sacrifice  in  mine  honour  and  I  will  cleanse  him  of  his  sin.  Let 
him  who  destroyed  Paka,  offer  up  the  sacred  Horse-sacrifice  and 
he  will  become  King  of  the  Gods  once  more,  without  having 
anything  to  fear.' 

"  Having  thus  addressed  the  Gods  in  these  words  like  unto 
Amrita,  Vishnu,  the  Lord  of  the  Celestials,  while  they  were  yet 
acclaiming  him,  returned  to  Trivishtapa." 


chapter   86 

Indra  is  liberated  by  means  of  the  Ashwamedha  Sacrifice 

Having  thus  described  the  slaying  of  Vritra  at  length,  Laksh- 
mana,  the  foremost  of  men,  continued  : — 

"  The  extremely  valiant  Vritra,  who  inspired  terror  in  the 
Gods,  being  destroyed,  Shakra,  his  slayer,  filled  with  the  guilt  of 
brahmanicide,  failed  to  return  to  his  senses  and,  having  taken 
refuge  at  the  end  of  the  worlds,  his  mind  confused,  distracted, 
he  remained  there  for  some  time,  resembling  a  serpent  that  is 
casting  its  slough.  And  the  Thousand-eyed  God,  having 
disappeared,  the  whole  world  was  agitated  and  the  earth  seemed 
to  be  lost,  bereft  of  its  humidity,  its  forests  dried  up.1  There 
were  no  running  waters  to  feed  the  lakes  and  rivers  and  a  great 
desolation  seized  all  beings  on  account  of  the  lack  of  rain. 

"  Then  the  Gods  seeing  the  decay  of  the  world,  which  filled 
them  with  distress,  began  to  prepare  for  the  sacrifice  according 
to  the  words  Vishnu  had  formerly  uttered,  and  all  the  Hosts 
of  the  Gods  accompanied  by  their  spiritual  preceptors  and  the 
Rishis  sought  out  the  terror-stricken  Indra  in  his  retreat. 

"  Beholding  Sahasraksha  assailed  by  the  guilt  of  brahmanicide, 
O  Foremost  of  Men,  and  having  paid  homage  to  the  Chief  of 
the  Gods,  they  performed  the  Ashwamedha.    O  Foremost  of 

1  He  being  the  sender  of  rain. 

599 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Men,  thereafter  the  great  Horse-sacrifice  took  place,  which  was 
offered  by  the  magnanimous  Mahendra  in  order  to  cleanse 
himself  of  the  sin  of  brahmanicide,  and  the  ceremony  being 
completed,  the  spirit  of  brahmanicide  issued  out  of  Indra's  body 
and  approaching  the  Gods  enquired  of  them  saying : — '  Tell  me, 
where  shall  be  my  abode  ? '  and  the  Gods  in  delight,  answered : — 
'  Divide  thyself  into  four  parts,  O  Evil  One  ! ' 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  the  mighty  Gods,  the  spirit  of  brah- 
manicide did  so,  varying  his  habitation,  he  with  whom  co- 
habitation is  a  disaster,  and  said  : — 

"  'Restraining  egoity  and  following  mine  own  whim  with  a 
quarter  of  myself  I  shall  inhabit  the  rivers  in  flood  in  the  rainy 
season.  With  another  quarter  undoubtedly  I  shall  dwell  perpetu- 
ally in  the  earth  as  Ushara.1  I  speak  the  truth  !  For  the  third 
portion  I  shall  live  for  three  nights  each  month  with  radiantly 
youthful  women,  whose  pride  I  shall  humble ;  with  my  fourth 
portion  I  shall  live  in  those  who  by  false  report  cause  the  death 
of  innocent  brahmins,  O  Mighty  Deities.' 

"  Then  the  Gods  answered,  saying : — *  O  Thou,  to  live  with 
whom  is  a  calamity,  do  as  thou  sayest,  accomplish  thy  design  ! ' 

"  Full  of  joy,  the  Gods  then  paid  homage  to  Vasava  of  a 
Thousand  Eyes,  who  was  cleansed  of  his  sin  and  delivered  from 
his  affliction.  And  Sahasraksha,  having  been  installed  on  the 
throne,  peace  came  to  the  whole  world  and  Indra  paid  homage 
to  that  wonderful  sacrifice. 

"  Such  is  the  pre-eminence  of  the  Ashwamedha  Ceremony,  O 
Joy  of  the  Raghus  !  Do  thou  perform  the  Horse-sacrifice  !  " 
Hearing  these  exalting  words  ofLakshmana,  whose  charm  touched 
his  heart,  that  magnanimous  sovereign,  the  equal  of  Indra  in 
strength  and  prowess,  experienced  supreme  satisfaction.

The  Story  of  Ila 

Having  listened  to  Lakshmana,  the  eloquent  and  powerful 
Raghava  answered  with  a  smile : — 
"  O  Best  of  Men,  Lakshmana,  that  which  thou  hast  related 

*  Ushara — Saline  soil.

UTTARA    KANDA 

regarding  the  slaying  of  Vritra  and  the  fruits  of  the  Horse- 
sacrifice  are  wholly  true,  O  Gentle  One.  It  is  said  that  formerly 
Kardama,  the  son  of  Prajapati,  the  extremely  virtuous  and 
blessed  Ila,  reigned  over  the  province  of  Bahlika.  That  highly 
illustrious  monarch,  O  Lion  of  Men,  having  made  the  entire 
earth  subject  to  him,  reigned  over  his  subjects  as  his  own  sons. 

"  The  magnanimous  Gods,  the  wealthy  Daityas,  the  Nagas, 
Rakshasas,  Gandharvas  and  Yakshas,  inspired  by  fear,  constantly 
worshipped  him,  O  Dear  Friend,  O  Joy  of  the  Raghus,  and  the 
Three  Worlds  trembled  before  that  irascible  potentate.  Such 
was  that  prince,  the  illustrious  Sovereign  of  the  Bahlikas,  full  of 
energy,  highly  intelligent  and  fixed  in  his  duty. 

"  During  the  lovely  month  of  Chaitra,  that  long-armed 
warrior  went  hunting  in  the  enchanting  forest  with  his  attendants, 
infantry  and  cavalry,  and  that  magnanimous  prince,  in  that  wood, 
slew  wild  beasts  in  their  hundreds  and  thousands,  yet  was  not 
sated.  Countless  animals  of  all  kinds  had  already  perished  when 
he  reached  the  country  where  Karttikeya  had  been  born.  There 
the  foremost  of  the  Gods,  the  invincible  Hara,  was  sporting  with 
the  daughter  of  the  King  of  the  Mountains,  and,  having  trans- 
formed himself  into  a  woman,  the  Lord  of  Uma,  whose  emblem 
is  the  bull,  sought  to  entertain  the  Goddess  in  the  midst  of  the 
waterfalls.  Wherever  there  were  male  beings  or  trees  in  the 
forest,  whatsoever  there  was,  assumed  a  female  form.  King  Ila, 
the  son  of  Kardama  penetrated  into  that  place  slaying  innumer- 
able beasts  and  he  observed  that  they  were  all  female,  thereafter 
he  became  aware  that  he  too  was  changed  into  a  woman,  as  also 
his  followers.  His  distress  was  great  on  this  metamorphosis  and 
he  recognized  it  to  be  the  work  of  Uma*s  consort  and  was  seized 
with  terror.  Thereupon  that  monarch,  with  his  attendants,  his 
army  and  his  chariots,  took  refuge  with  that  mighty  blue-throated 
God,  Kapardin,  and  the  magnanimous  Maheshwara,  laughing 
with  that  Goddess,  the  bestower  of  grace,  said  to  the  son  of 
Prajapati : — 

"  *  Rise,  rise,  O  Royal  Rishi,  O  Valiant  son  of  Kardama,  except 
manhood,  ask  what  thou  wilt ! '  The  king  was  sorely  disappoin- 
ted by  this  reply  of  the  magnanimous  Shiva.  Transformed  into 
a  woman,  he  did  not  wish  to  accept  any  other  boon  from  the 
foremost  of  the  Gods  and,  in  his  profound  distress,  that  prince, 
601 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

falling  at  the  feet  of  the  daughter  of  the  King  of  the  Mountains, 
Uma,  with  his  whole  heart  entreated  her,  saying : — 

"  '  O  Thou  who  distributes!  thy  favours  in  all  the  worlds,  O 
Lovely  Goddess,  whose  sight  is  never  fruitless,  cast  thy  merciful 
glance  upon  me !  * 

"  Knowing  what  was  passing  in  the  heart  of  the  Rajarishi,  that 
Goddess,  who  stood  before  Hara,  she,  the  consort  of  Rudra, 
made  this  reply  : — 

" '  Half  the  boon,  that  thou  dost  beg  of  us  both,  shall  be 
granted  by  Mahadeva  and  the  other  half  by  me,  therefore 
receive  this  half  from  man  and  woman  according  to  thy  desire  ! ' 

"  Hearing  that  remarkable  and  unparalleled  boon  bestowed  by 
that  Goddess,  the  king,  overcome  with  joy,  said  : — 

"  *  If  I  have  found  favour  with  thee,  O  Goddess,  whose  beauty 
is  unrivalled  on  earth,  may  I  be  a  woman  during  one  month  and, 
in  the  second  month,  assume  the  form  of  a  man  !  * 

"  Then  that  Goddess  of  gracious  mien,  understanding  his 
desire,  answered  amicably : — 

"  '  It  shall  be  so,  O  King,  and  when  thou  art  a  man,  thou  shalt 
not  remember  thou  wast  ever  a  woman  and,  in  the  succeeding 
month,  having  become  a  woman,  thou  shalt  forget  thou  wast 
ever  a  man  ! ' 

"  That  is  how  that  king,  born  of  Kardama,  being  a  man  for  one 
month  became  a  woman  the  following  month  under  the  name  of 
Ila,  the  most  lovely  female  in  the  Three  Worlds." 


chapter    88 

Budha  encounters  Ila 

The  story  of  Ila,  related  by  Rama,  greatly  astonished  Lakshmana 
and  Bharata,  and  both,  with  joined  palms,  requested  him  to 
recount  further  details  of  that  magnanimous  King  and  his 
transformations,  saying : — 

"  What  did  that  wretched  king  do  when  he  was  transformed 
into  a  woman  and  how  did  he  conduct  himself  when  he  became  a 
man  once  more  ?  " 

602 


UTTARA    KANDA 

Hearing  these  words  inspired  by  curiosity,  Kakutstha  told 
them  what  had  happened  to  that  monarch,  saying : — 

"  Having  been  transformed  into  a  woman,  he  passed  the  first 
month  amidst  his  female  attendants,  his  former  courtiers,  and 
that  lady,  the  most  beautiful  on  earth,  whose  eyes  resembled 
lotus  petals,  entering  a  deep  forest,  wandering  on  foot  amongst 
the  copses,  bushes  and  creepers,  having  given  up  all  conveyances, 
sported  in  the  winding  vale.  Now  in  that  wooded  region,  not 
far  from  the  mountain,  lay  a  charming  lake  frequented  by  birds 
of  every  kind  ;  there  Ila  beheld  Budha,1  the  son  of  the  Moon, 
who  was  as  radiant  as  that  orb  on  rising. 

"  Budha,  who  remained  inaccessible  in  the  waters,  had  given 
himself  up  to  a  rigid  penance,  and  that  illustrious  Sage  was 
benevolent  and  extremely  compassionate.  In  her  astonishment, 
Ila  agitated  the  waters  with  her  companions,  and  beholding  her, 
Budha  fell  under  the  sway  of  the  God  of  Love  with  his  shafts 
and,  no  longer  self-controlled,  became  restless,  as  he  stood  in  the 
lake.  Seeing  Ila,  whose  beauty  was  unsurpassed  in  the  Three 
Worlds,  he  reflected  : — '  Who  is  this  lady,  more  lovely  than  the 
Celestials  ?  I  have  never  before  beheld  such  radiance  amongst 
the  wives  of  Devas,  Nagas,  Asuras  or  Apsaras.  If  she  is  not 
already  wedded  to  another,  she  is  worthy  of  me ! ' 

"As  he  delayed,  thinking  thus,  the  company  left  the  water  and 
Budha,  pondering,  emerged  therefrom.  Thereafter  those 
women  having  been  summoned  by  him  went  to  his  retreat  and 
they  paid  obeisance  to  him,  whereupon  that  virtuous  ascetic 
enquired  of  them,  saying : — 

" c  To  whom  does  this  lady,  the  most  lovely  in  all  the  world, 
belong?  Why  has  she  come  here?  Tell  me  all  without  hesitation.' 

"  Hearing  these  fair  words  spoken  in  gentle  tones,  all  those 
women  answered  with  sweet  voices,  saying : — 

" ( That  lady  is  our  mistress,  she  has  no  husband  and  wanders 
in  the  woods  in  our  company.* 

"  Hearing  the  reply  of  those  women,  that  Twice-born  called 
to  mind  the  science  by  which  all  may  be  perceived,8  whereupon 
he  became  conversant  with  all  that  had  passed  regarding  King 
Ha,  and  that  foremost  of  Sages  said  to  those  women  : —

feed  on  roots,  leaves  and  fruits  and  shall  have  Kimpurushas  as 
your  consorts ! ' 

"At  this  command  of  the  son  of  Soma,  those  women,  who  were 
men,  having  been  transformed  into  Kimpurushis,  took  up  their 
abode  on  the  slopes  of  the  mountain." 


chapter   89 

The  Birth  of  Pururavas 

Hearing  of  the  origin  of  the  Kimpurushis,  Lakshmana  and 
Bharata  both  said  to  Rama,  that  Lord  of  Men,  "  How  wonder- 
ful!  " 

Thereafter  the  illustrious  and  virtuous  Rama  continued  the 
story  of  Ila,  the  son  of  Prajapati,  saying : — 

"  When  he  saw  that  all  those  troops  of  Kinnaris  had  departed, 
the  foremost  of  the  Rishis  said  to  the  beautiful  Ila  with  a  smile : — 

"'lam  the  beloved  son  of  Soma,  O  Lady  of  gracious  mien, 
do  thou  look  on  me  with  favour  ! ' 

"  Thus  did  he  speak  in  that  lonely  forest  deserted  by  the 
others,  and  that  gracious  and  beautiful  solitary  One  answered 
him,  saying : — 

"  *  O  Dear  Son  of  Soma,  I  range  where  I  will,  I  am  at  thy 
service,  do  whatsoever  pleaseth  thee  ! ' 

"  Hearing  this  charming  reply,  the  son  of  the  moon  was 
overjoyed  and  united  himself  with  her  in  love.  Thereafter  the 
enamoured  Budha  passed  the  month  of  Madhu,2  that  vanished 
like  a  moment,  in  dalliance  with  Ila,  and,  the  month  having 
expired,  that  moon-faced  one  awoke  from  her  couch  and  beheld 
the  son  of  Soma  given  over  to  the  practice  of  penance  in  the 
waters,  supportless,  his  arms  upstretched,  and  said  to  him ; — 

"  '  O  Blessed  One,  I  came  to  this  inaccessible  mountain  with 

1  Kimpurushis — The  females  of  the  Kimpurushas,   beings  who  are  half 
human,  sometimes  identified  with  the  Kinneras. 
1  Madhu — The  month  that  is  part  of  February  and  March.

my  train  of  attendants,  I  do  not  see  them  anywhere,  where  have 
they  gone  ?  * 

"  Hearing  the  words  of  the  Rajarishi,  who  had  lost  all 
knowledge  of  the  past,  Budha,  in  order  to  re-assure  him,  said  in 
friendly  tones  : — 

"  *A  great  hailstorm  overwhelmed  thy  attendants  whilst  thou 
wast  asleep,  having  taken  refuge  in  the  hermitage  in  fear  of  the 
wind  and  rain.  Be  happy,  banish  all  anxiety  and  calm  thyself! 
O  Hero,  live  here  in  peace,  nourishing  thyself  on  fruit  and  roots.' 

"  The  King,  comforted  by  these  words,  then  made  this  noble 
reply,  in  the  distress  that  the  loss  of  his  people  caused  him  : — 

" '  I  cannot  abandon  my  kingdom,  though  deprived  of  my 
servants ;  I  must  not  delay  an  instant,  O  Illustrious  Ascetic, 
permit  me  to  depart.  I  have  an  elder  son  fixed  in  his  duty  and 
extremely  illustrious,  O  Brahmin,  his  name  is  Shashabindu ; 
he  shall  succeed  me.  Kay,  I  cannot  abandon  my  consorts  and 
my  good  servants,  O  Illustrious  Ascetic,  do  not  reproach  me.' 

"  Thus  spoke  that  Indra  among  monarchs  and  Budha,  who 
first  consoled  him,  then  addressed  these  astonishing  words  to 
him,  saying : — 

" '  Be  pleased  to  remain  here ;  do  not  grieve,  O  Mighty 
Kardameya  ;  at  the  end  of  the  year  I  will  grant  thee  a  boon.' 

"  Hearing  these  words  of  Budha  of  imperishable  deeds,  who 
was  conversant  with  the  Veda,  Ila  resolved  to  remain  there.  The 
following  month,  becoming  a  woman,  he  spent  in  dalliance  with 
Budha  and,  thereafter,  becoming  a  man  once  more,  he  passed 
the  time  in  the  exercise  of  duty.  In  the  ninth  month  the  lovely 
Ila  gave  birth  to  a  son,  the  mighty  Pururavas  and,  after  he  was 
born,  she  gave  the  child  into  the  paternal  hands  of  Budha,  whom 
he  resembled." 

CHAPTER    90 

Ila  regains  her  natural  State  through  the  Performance 
of  the  Ashwamedha  Sacrifice 

Rama  having  related  the  story  of  the  marvellous  birth  of 
Pururavas,  the  illustrious  Lakshmana  and  Bharata  enquired  of 
him  once  more,  saying : — 

605 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

"After  Ila  had  passed  a  year  with  the  son  of  the  Moon-god, 
what  did  she  do  ?   O  Lord  of  the  Earth,  tell  us  all !  " 

Thus  questioned  by  his  two  brothers  in  affectionate  tones, 
Rama  continued  to  relate  the  story  of  Ila,  the  son  of  Prajapati, 
and  said  : — 

"  That  hero,  having  recovered  his  manhood,  the  extremely 
intelligent  and  illustrious  Budha  called  together  the  Sages,  the 
extremely  noble  Samvarta,  Chyavana  the  son  of  Bhrigu,  the 
Ascetic  Arishtanemi,  Pramodana,  Modakara  and  the  Hermit 
Durvasa.  When  they  were  all  assembled,  the  eloquent  Budha, 
able  to  discern  the  truth,  said  to  those  Sages,  his  friends,  who 
were  endowed  with  great  power : — 

" *  Learn  what  has  happened  to  that  long-armed  king,  the  son 
of  Kardama,  so  that  his  happiness  may  be  re-established  !' 

"  While  those  Twice-born  were  conversing  thus,  Kardama 
came  to  that  forest  accompanied  by  Poulastya,  Kratu,  Vashat- 
kara,  and  Omkara  of  great  effulgence.  All  those  ascetics,  happy 
to  find  themselves  together  and  wishing  to  be  of  service  to  the 
Lord  of  Bahli,  each  voiced  their  views  about  him ;  Kardama, 
however,  expressed  himself  with  extreme  wisdom  for  the  good 
of  his  son,  and  said : — 

" '  O  Twice-born  Ones,  hear  what  I  have  to  say  for  the 
happiness  of  the  prince.  I  see  no  remedy  apart  from  the  God 
who  has  the  bull  as  bis  emblem.  There  is  no  sacrifice  greater 
than  the  Ashwamedha,  which  is  dear  to  the  heart  of  the  mighty 
Rudra.    Let  us  therefore  perform  this  mighty  sacrifice.' 

"  Thus  spoke  Kardama  and  all  the  foremost  of  Sages  approved 
these  means  of  propitiating  Rudra. 

"  Thereafter  a  Rajarishi,  the  disciple  of  Samvarta,  the 
Conqueror  of  Hostile  Citadels,  whose  name  was  Marutta, 
performed  that  great  sacrifice  which  took  place  near  Budha*s 
hermitage,  whereupon  the  glorious  Rudra  was  extremely 
gratified  and,  the  ceremony  being  accomplished,  the  consort  of 
Uma,  in  an  excess  of  joy,  addressed  all  those  Sages,  in  Ila's 
presence,  saying : — 

"  i  am  pleased  with  your  devotion  in  the  Ashwamedha 

Sacrifice,    O  Illustrious  Brahmins,  what  shall  I  do  for  this  King 

of  the  Bahlis  ?  *   Thus  did  the  Lord  of  the  Gods  speak,  and  the 

Sages,  in  deep  recollection,  caused  the  Lord  of  the  Gods  to 

606 


UTTARA    KANDA 

look  upon  them  with  favour  so  that  Ha  might  regain  his  manhood. 
Then  Mahadeva,  gratified,  gave  him  back  his  virility  and  having 
conferred  that  favour  on  Ua,  the  mighty  God  disappeared. 

"  The  Horse-sacrifice  being  complete  and  Hara  having  ren- 
dered himself  invisible,  all  those  Twice-born,  of  penetrating 
gaze,  returned  whence  they  had  come.  The  king,  however, 
renouncing  his  capital,  founded  the  city  of  Pratishthana  in  the 
central  region,  which  was  unsurpassed  in  splendour,  whilst 
Shashabindu,  that  Rajarishi,  Conqueror  of  Hostile  Cities,  dwelt 
in  Bahli.  From  that  time  Pratishthana  became  the  residence  of 
King  Ila,  the  valiant  son  of  Prajapati,  and,  his  time  having  come, 
he  went  to  Brahma's  abode. 

"  The  son  of  Ila,  the  King  Pururavas  succeeded  him  in 
Pratishthana.  Such  is  the  merit  of  the  Ashwamedha  Sacrifice, 
O  Bull  among  Men.  Ila,  who  was  formerly  a  woman,  became  a 
man  again,  which  would  have  been  impossible  by  any  other 
means." 


CHAPTER     91 

Rama  gives  the  command  for  the  Ashwamedha  Sacrifice 
to  be  performed 

Having  related  this  history  to  his  two  brothers,  Kakutstha  of 
immeasurable  glory,  addressed  these  pious  words  to  Lakshmana, 
saying : — 

"Assemble  for  counsel,  Vasishtha,  Vamadeva,  Javali,  Kashyapa 
and  all  the  brahmins  learned  in  the  Ashwamedha  Sacrifice.  O 
Lakshmana,  I  shall  loose  the  caparisoned  steed  in  accord  with 
tradition !  " 

On  this  command  being  communicated  to  him,  Lakshmana, 
of  swift  step,  assembled  all  those  Sages  and  ushered  them  into 
Rama's  presence.  When  they  beheld  Rama,  who  resembled  a 
God,  paying  obeisance  to  their  feet,  they  showered  blessings 
upon  him.  Having  performed  the  Pranjali,1  Raghava  addressed 
those  Sages  on  the  Ashwamedha  Sacrifice,  in  a  speech  inspired 
by  dharma.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Hearing  the  words  of  Rama  and  having  offered  homage  to  the 
God,  whose  emblem  is  the  Bull,  all  those  Twice-born  praised 
the  Ashwamedha  highly,  and  that  eulogy  greatly  delighted 
Kakutstha,  who  seeing  them  ready  to  perform  the  ceremony, 
said  to  Lakshmana  : — 

"  O  Long-armed  Hero,  make  known  to  the  magnanimous 
Sugriva  that  he  should  come  here  with  his  great  monkeys  and  the 
innumerable  dwellers  in  the  woods  in  order  to  enjoy  this  great 
festival  and  be  happy.  Let  Bibishana,  he  who  has  no  rival  in 
valour,  come  surrounded  by  bis  host  of  Rakshasas,  moving 
where  they  will,  in  order  to  assist  me  in  the  great  Ashwamedha 
Sacrifice.  Let  wealthy  monarchs,  who  wish  to  render  me  a 
service,  come  in  all  haste  with  their  retinues  to  see  the  place  of 
sacrifice  and  all  the  virtuous  Twice-born,  who  have  gone  to 
foreign  lands,  summon  them  all  to  the  Ashwamedha  Sacrifice,  O 
Lakshmana.  Invite  all  the  Rishis,  those  long-armed  warriors, 
mines  of  asceticism,  who  live  in  distant  parts  with  their  wives, 
as  also  the  players  on  the  cymbals,  jugglers  and  dancers. 

"  Let  a  vast  structure  be  set  up  near  the  Gaumati  River  in  the 
Kaimisha  Wood,  O  Long-armed  Warrior,  it  is  pre-eminently  a 
sacred  spot.  Let  propitiatory  rites  be  performed  everywhere 
and  hundreds  of  brahmins,  conversant  with  the  law,  assist  in 
the  Naimisha  Wood  at  this  great  sacrifice,  the  highest  of  all  and 
which  is  unsurpassed,  O  Joy  of  the  Raghus.  Assemble  all  the 
people  speedily,  O  Virtuous  Prince,  and  do  not  let  them  depart 
ill-contented,  unsatisfied  or  without  having  been  loaded  with 
favours  according  to  tradition.  O  Hero,  send  out  in  advance  a 
hundred  thousand  loads  of  rice  in  good  condition  and  an 
ayuta  of  sesamum  seed  and  beans  as  well  as  chick-peas, 
lentils,  quantities  of  salt,  oil  of  good  quality  and  innumerable 
perfumes. 

"  Let  Bharata  first  carefully  furnish  a  hundred  kotis  of  gold 
and  as  much  silver,  and  go  before.  In  the  centre,  the  merchants, 
all  the  jugglers,  dancers,  cooks  and  women  should  be  ranged,  let 
them  be  numerous  and  young  in  heart ;  the  troops,  however, 
should  go  in  advance  with  Bharata.  Shopkeepers,  children,  the 
aged,  the  Twice-born  in  profound  meditation,  the  masons, 
carpenters,  agents  and  also  the  mothers  and  women  of  the 
Princes  apartments  with  the  golden  statue  of  my  consort  for

UTTARA    KANDA 

consecration,  as  also  skilled  sacrificers,  should  be  first  assembled 
by  the  illustrious  Bharata,  who  will  precede  them. 

"  O  Prince,  he  will  cause  pavilions  to  be  set  up  worthy  of  the 
mighty  kings  and  their  suites.  Food,  drink  and  raiment  should 
be  supplied  for  those  brilliant  escorts." 

Thereafter  Bharata  went  away  followed  by  Shatrughna  and 
the  magnanimous  monkeys  who  surrounded  Sugriva,  accom- 
panied by  the  leading  priests.  Bibishana,  at  the  head  of  the 
Rakshasas  and  women  in  great  numbers,  provided  an  escort  for 
the  Rishis  of  rigid  penance. 


chapter   92 

Description  of  the  Ashwamedha  Sacrifice 

Having  arranged  everything  in  detail  with  dispatch,  the  elder 
brother  of  Bharata  loosed  the  horse  marked  with  black  spots, 
adorned  with  bis  own  insignia.  Placing  Lakshmana,  assisted  by 
the  priests,  in  charge  of  the  steed,  he  himself  went  to  the 
Naimisha  Wood  with  his  army. 

That  long-armed  prince,  beholding  the  vast  and  beautiful 
sacrificial  spot,  was  greatly  delighted  and  exclaimed,  "How 
wonderful !  "  During  his  sojourn  in  the  Naimisha  Wood,  the 
kings  brought  all  their  gifts  to  Rama  and  he,  in  his  turn,  provided 
for  them  abundantly  with  food,  drink  and  provisions  of  every 
kind.  Bharata  and  Shatrughna  were  in  the  service  of  the  king ; 
the  magnanimous  monkeys,  who  accompanied  Sugriva,  attended 
on  the  priests  with  humility  ;  Bibishana  with  his  innumerable 
titans  became  the  most  diligent  servitors  of  those  Rishis  of  rigid 
penance.  Sumptuous  pavilions  set  up  for  the  powerful  monarchs 
and  their  retinues  were  under  the  orders  of  that  most  valiant  prince. 
Such  were  the  excellent  arrangements  devised  for  the  Ashwa- 
medha Sacrifice. 

Meantime  Lakshmana  carefully  watched  over  the  comings  and 
goings  of  the  horse.  Thus  did  that  magnanimous  Lion  among 
monarchs  proceed  with  the  utmost  punctiliousness  in  this 
foremost  of  sacrifices,  during  which  nothing  was  heard  but 
'  Give  lavishly  of  all  that  is  sought,'  and,  in  the  Ashwamedha 
609 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Sacrifice,  that  liberal  Prince  furnished  all  that  everyone  required 
till  they  were  fully  satisfied.  Sweet  dishes  of  every  kind, 
confections,  till  they  were  no  longer  in  demand,  were  distributed 
by  monkeys  and  titans,  and  no-one  was  seen  in  rags  or  afflicted 
or  hungry,  but,  in  that  splendid  royal  feast,  only  those  who  were 
happy  and  satisfied  could  be  observed.  Amongst  the  venerable 
Sages  present,  the  oldest  could  not  remember  a  sacrifice  where 
such  prodigious  liberality  had  taken  place. 

Those  who  desired  gold  received  gold,  those  who  preferred 
possessions  received  them,  those  who  coveted  jewels  had  jewels 
bestowed  upon  them ;  and  one  beheld  silver,  gold,  gems  and 
raiment  being  distributed  continually  in  great  quantities. 

*  Neither  Shakra,  nor  Soma,  nor  Yama,  nor  Varuna  have 
ever  achieved  anything  of  such  magnitude '  proclaimed  the 
ascetics ;  and,  on  every  side,  monkeys  and  titans  stood  distributing 
raiment,  silver  and  rice  in  profusion  to  those  who  sought  them. 

This  sacrifice  of  that  foremost  of  monarchs  was  carried  out  in 
accord  with  every  tradition  and,  at  the  end  of  a  whole  year,  it 
still  had  not  come  to  a  close,  nor  was  the  treasury  exhausted. 


chapter   93 

Valmiki  commands  Kusha  and  Lava  to  recite  the  Ramayana 

As  this  most  wonderful  sacrifice  was  proceeding,  the  disciples  of 
Valmiki,  that  blessed  Sage,  suddenly  came  there  and,  having 
witnessed  the  divine  festival,  admirable  to  behold,  that  company 
of  Rishis  constructed  some  comfortable  huts  a  tittle  way  off. 
Innumerable  bullock  carts  full  of  provisions,  with  excellent 
fruit  and  roots  were  heaped  in  Valmiki's  charming  grove,  and 
thereafter  that  Sage  said  to  his  disciples,  Kusha  and  Lava  : — 

"  Go,  and  with  great  enthusiasm  sing  the  Epic  Ramayana, 
cheerfully  and  carefully,  in  the  sacred  enclosures  of  the  Rishis, 
the  dwellings  of  the  brahmins,  along  the  roads  and  highways  and 
in  the  residence  of  princes,  and  especially  it  should  be  sung  at  the 
gate  of  Rama's  pavilion,  where  the  sacrifice  is  taking  place  and 
also  before  the  priests. 

"  Here  are  savoury  fruits  of  every  kind  that  grow  in  the 
610 


UTTARA    KANDA 

mountainous  regions,  eat  and  then  sing.  You  will  not  experience 
any  fatigue,  O  Dear  Ones,  on  account  of  these  roots  and  succu- 
lent fruits  that  will  preserve  the  purity  of  your  voices.  If  Rama, 
the  Lord  of  the  Earth,  indicates  that  you  should  be  heard  by  the 
assembled  Sages,  act  accordingly.  Each  time  you  will  have 
twenty  Sargas1  to  sing,  which  you  have  previously  learnt  from 
me.  Above  all,  do  not  entertain  the  least  desire  for  reward  !  Of 
what  use  is  gold  to  ascetics  who  live  on  fruit  and  roots  ?  If 
Kakutstha  questions  you,  saying  '  Who  is  your  Master  ?  * 
answer  the  king  in  this  wise,  *  We  are  both  the  disciples  of  the 
great  Sage  Valmiki ! '  Sing  without  fear  to  the  accompaniment 
of  these  stringed  instruments  of  a  tone  unknown  heretofore,  that 
you  have  tuned  sweetly.  Sing  the  poem  from  the  beginning 
without  showing  any  lack  of  respect  to  the  king,  who  is  the 
Father  of  all  beings  according  to  the  law. 

"  To-morrow  therefore,  at  dawn,  with  a  cheerful  heart  and 
taking  care  to  sing  with  sweet  voices,  accompany  yourselves  on 
these  stringed  instruments  of  harmonized  intervals." 

Having  repeatedly  issued  these  instructions,  that  ascetic  born 
of  Pracetas,2  of  noble  birth,  the  illustrious  Sage  Valmiki,  became 
silent. 

On  receiving  the  commands  of  that  Sage,  the  two  sons  of 
Maithili  humbly  answered  "  We  will  act  in  accord  with  thy 
behests !  "  and  those  Conquerors  of  Hostile  Cities  then  took 
their  leave. 

Those  youthful  boys  allowed  the  excellent  counsels  of  the 
Rishi  to  enter  their  hearts,  as  the  Ashwins  receive  the  teachings 
of  Bhargava  and,  eager  to  put  them  into  practice,  they  whiled 
away  that  auspicious  night.

When  the  dawn  appeared,  those  two  youthful  ascetics,  having 

bathed  and  ignited  the  sacred  fire,  began  to  sing,  as  the  Rishi 
had  previously  instructed  them  to  do.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Kakutstha  listened  to  that  poem,  composed  by  the  aged 
Valmiki,  unheard  till  then,  set  to  music  in  multiple  cadences, 
accompanied  by  stringed  instruments,  in  measured  rhythm, 
and,  hearing  those  youthful  musicians,  Raghava  was  greatly 
mystified. 

During  an  interval  in  the  sacrifice,  that  foremost  of  monarchs 
called  together  the  great  Sages,  Kings,  Pundits,  Naigamas,*  aged 
Grammarians,  venerable  brahmins  and  those  versed  in  music, 
the  Twice-born,  those  learned  in  omens  and  the  citizens  specially 
instructed  in  aesthetics,  those  who  had  knowledge  of  metres, 
words  and  accents,  those  who  knew  the  different  rhythms  and 
measures,  those  versed  in  astronomy,  those  skilled  in  the  science 
of  sacrifices  and  rituals  and  experienced  liturgists,  those  versed 
in  discerning  cause  and  effect,  philosophers,  scholars,  teachers  of 
hymns  and  legends  and  the  Veda,  those  conversant  with  the 
Vrittas  and  Sutras,  and  also  singers  and  dancers. 

Thereafter,  having  assembled  them  all,  Rama  ushered  in  the 
two  singers  to  that  vast  and  murmuring  throng  of  listeners  for  his 
own  great  pleasure.  The  two  youthful  disciples  of  the  Sage 
began  that  recitation  that  unrolled  melodiously,  like  unto  the 
singing  of  the  Gandharvas,  nor  could  the  company  be  sated  with 
listening  to  so  beautiful  a  song.  In  their  delight,  ascetics  and 
great  potentates,  seemed  to  consume  those  musicians  with  their 
gaze,  whom  they  looked  upon  again  and  again,  and  the  whole 
assembly  having  centred  its  attention  upon  them,  each  said  to 
his  neighbour : — '  Both  resemble  Rama,  like  twin  representa- 
tions of  the  same  planet.  If  they  did  not  wear  matted  locks  and 
bark  robes,  we  should  see  no  difference  between  the  singers  and 
Raghava ! * 

As  the  people  of  town  and  country  spoke  thus,  Kusha  and 
Lava,  having  introduced  the  first  part  according  to  Narada's 
instructions,  continued  up  to  the  twentieth  Sargaa  during  the 
afternoon,  then  Raghava,  having  heard  the  twenty  Sargas,  said 
to  his  beloved  brother,  "  Give  these  two  musicians  eighteen 
thousand  gold  pieces  immediately  with  aught  else  that  they  may 
desire,  O  Kakutstha  !  "3   Thereupon  Saumitri  instantly  offered

this  to  those  youthful  boys,  one  after  the  other,  but  the  great- 
souled  Kusha  and  Lava  would  not  accept  the  gold  that  was 
presented  to  them,  enquiring  in  astonishment,  "  What  good  is 
this  ?  Grain,  fruit  and  roots  suffice  ascetics  like  ourselves,  what 
should  we  do  with  gold  or  silver  in  die  forest  ?  " 

These  words  amazed  all  Rama's  assistants  extremely  and, 
desiring  to  know  the  origin  of  the  poem,  that  illustrious  prince 
enquired  of  those  two  disciples  of  the  ascetic,  saying : — 

"  What  is  this  poetical  composition  ?  Where  is  the  residence 
of  the  sublime  author  of  this  great  epic  ?  Where  is  this  bull 
among  the  ascetics  ?  " 

On  this  enquiry  from  Raghava,  the  two  disciples  of  the  Sage 
answered,  saying : — 

"  The  blessed  Valmiki,  who  is  attending  the  sacrifice,  is  the 
author  of  the  poem  in  which  thine  whole  life  is  told.  Twenty- 
four  thousand  verses  and  a  hundred  Upakhyanas1  have  been 
used  by  that  ascetic,  the  son  of  Bhrigu.*  Five  hundred  Sargas 
divided  into  six  Kandas,  together  with  the  Uttarakanda,  O  King, 
are  the  work  of  that  magnanimous  Rishi,  our  Gum.  Thy 
conduct,  thy  circumstances,  thine  entire  life  is  unrolled  with  its 
vicissitudes.  If  thou  desirest  it,  O  King,  thou  mayest  hear  it 
from  us  in  the  intervals  of  the  sacrifice,  in  thy  moments  of  leisure. 

Thereafter  Rama,  accompanied  by  the  Sages  and  magnanimous 
monarchs,  having  heard  that  melodious  chant,  returned  to  the 
sacrificial  pavilion. 

That  recitation  accompanied  by  Talas  and  Layas,3  divided  into 
Sargas  in  harmonious  notes  and  tones,  in  which  the  scansion  was 
stressed  by  the  stringed  instruments,  was  heard  by  the  King 
from  the  lips  of  Kusha  and  Lava. 


CHAPTER   95 

Rama  sends  for  Sita 

Surrounded  by  the  ascetics,  kings  and  monkeys,  Rama  listened 
during  many  days  to  the  sublime  and  wonderful  epic,  and  while

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

the  two  sons  of  Sita,  Kusha  and  Lava,  were  singing,  he  recog- 
nized them.  Having  reflected  deeply,  he  summoned  messengers 
of  virtuous  conduct  and  in  the  assembly  spoke  to  them  of  that 
princess,  saying: — 
"  Go  and  repeat  my  words  to  that  Blessed  One  and  say : — 
" '  If  she  be  irreproachable  in  her  conduct  and  without  sin, 
then,  should  she  so  desire  it  and  has  the  approval  of  the  Rishi, 
let  her  prove  her  good  faith !  *  Do  you  then  return  and  inform 
me  concerning  this  matter.  To-morrow  at  dawn,  let  Maithili, 
the  daughter  of  Janaka  attest  her  purity  on  oath  in  my  presence, 
before  the  assembly  !  " 

At  this  extremely  significant  command  from  Raghava,  the 
messengers  straightway  went  to  seek  out  the  foremost  of  the 
ascetics  and,  bowing  to  that  Sage,  who  shone  with  infinite 
effulgence,  they,  with  humility,  communicated  Rama's  words  to 
him. 

Hearing  them,  the  extremely  illustrious  ascetic,  learning  of 
Rama's  wish,  said  "  Be  it  so  !    May  prosperity  attend  you  !  " 

Thereafter  those  royal  messengers  returned  with  the  Muni's 
answer  and  repeated  it  faithfully  to  Raghava  and  he,  being 
informed  of  the  decision  of  that  magnanimous  Sage,  full  of  joy, 
addressed  the  Rishis  and  the  assembled  kings,  saying : — 

"  O  Blessed  Ones,  with  your  disciples,  the  kings  and  their 
attendants  and  whosoever  may  wish  to  do  so,  bear  witness  to  the 
vow  that  Sita  will  make  !  " 

These  words  of  the  magnanimous  Raghava  were  praised  by  all 
the  leading  Rishis  and  those  mighty  kings  who  addressed  the 
monarch  saying : — 

"  Such  conduct  is  only  possible  in  Thee  and  is  found  nowhere 
else  in  the  world,  O  Prince !  " 

Having  resolved  thus,  Raghava,  the  Scourge  of  his  Foes, 
said : — 

"  To-morrow  this  shall  take  place,"  whereupon  he  dismissed 
the  assembly. 

The  trial  by  oath  being  fixed  for  the  following  day,  the 
magnanimous  and  illustrious  Rama  gave  leave  to  all  the  great 
Sages  and  Kings  to  depart.

CHAPTER     96 

Valndki  leads  Sita  before  Rama 

When  the  night  had  passed,  the  great  descendant  of  Raghu  went 
to  the  place  of  sacrifice  to  which  he  had  summoned  all  the  Rishis  : 
Vasishtha,  Vamadeva,  Javali,  Kashyapa,  Vishvamitra,  Dirghat- 
mas  and  Durvasa  of  rigid  penances,  also  Poulastya  and  Shakti, 
Bhargava,  Vamana,  Markandeya,  Dhirghayus  and  the  highly 
renowned  Maudgalya,  Garga,  Chyavana,  the  virtuous  Shatan- 
anda,  the  far-famed  Bharadwaja,  the  illustrious  Agniputra, 
Narada,  Parvata  and  Gautama  of  great  glory,  all  these  ascetics 
and  others  of  austere  observances,  in  great  numbers. 

Inspired  by  curiosity,  they  all  assembled,  as  also  the  intrepid 
titans  ;  and  the  valiant  monkeys  and  kings,  intrigued,  gathered 
there  in  like  manner,  with  the  warriors,  merchants  and  thousands 
of  the  lower  caste.  Brahmins  of  rigid  penances  arrived  from 
every  region  and  all  met  together  to  be  present  at  the  taking  of 
the  oath  by  Sita  ;  and  that  immense  multitude  stood  absolutely 
motionless,  as  if  turned  to  stone. 

Knowing  that  all  were  come,  the  foremost  of  Sages  immediately 
approached  with  Sita  following  him,  her  head  bowed,  her  palms 
joined,  choked  with  sobs,  her  mind  absorbed  in  Rama. 

Beholding  Sita  walking  behind  Valmiki,  like  unto  the  holy 
Shruti  following  in  Brahma's  footsteps,  there  arose  a  great 
clamour  with  cries  of  "  Halahala !  "  from  all  those  who  were 
oppressed  with  profound  sorrow  on  account  of  the  unfortunate 
princess.  And  some  cried  "  Hail,  O  Rama  !  "  and  some  "  Hail, 
O  Sita  !  "  while  the  rest  acclaimed  both.  Thereafter,  advancing 
amidst  that  multitude,  the  foremost  of  the  ascetics,  accompanied 
by  Sita,  addressed  Raghava,  saying  : — 

"  I  am  Valmiki,  and  here,  O  Dasarathi,  is  Sita  of  virtuous  ways 
and  conduct,  who,  on  account  of  calumny,  was  abandoned  near 
mine  hermitage,  the  censure  of  the  people  having  inspired  thee 
with  fear,  O  Virtuous  One !  Sita  will  prove  her  innocence ;  it 
is  for  thee  to  issue  the  command.  These  two  sons  of  Janata, 
twin  brothers,  invincible  heroes,  are  thy  sons  also ;  I  speak  the 
615 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

truth  to  thee !  I  am  the  tenth  son  of  Pracetas,  O  Joy  of  the 
Raghus,  I  do  not  recollect  ever  having  uttered  a  he ;  truly  these 
are  thy  two  children.  During  countless  years  I  have  practised 
asceticism,  may  I  never  reap  the  fruits  thereof  if  Maithili  be 
guilty !  I  have  nothing  wherewith  to  reproach  myself  regarding 
thought,  word  or  deed ;  if  Maithili  be  guilty,  may  I  never  gather 
the  fruits  thereof!  With  my  five  senses  and  the  mind  as  the 
sixth,  meditating  amidst  the  forest  waterfalls,  Sita's  innocence 
was  revealed  to  me.  That  lady  of  irreproachable  and  pure 
conduct,  to  whom  her  lord  is  a  God,  will  give  proof  of  her  good 
faith,  O  Thou  who  didst  fear  public  condemnation  !  O  Foremost 
of  Men,  here  is  that  lady  whom  I  proclaim  to  be  essentially 
chaste,  I  whose  vision  is  divinely  illumined  and  who,  though  she 
was  supremely  dear  to  thee  and  her  innocence  well  known,  thou 
didst  repudiate  when  thy  spirit  was  troubled  by  the  censure  of 
the  people !  '* 


chapter    97 

Sita  descends  into  the  Earth 

Thus  spoke  Valmiki,  and  Raghava,  on  seeing  that  fair-com- 
plexioned  princess,  with  joined  palms,  answered  in  the  presence 
of  the  assembly  : — 

"  O  Fortunate  and  virtuous  Brahmin,  may  it  be  so  !  I  fully 
concur  in  thine  irreproachable  words.  This  assurance  was 
formerly  given  to  me  by  Vaidehi  in  the  presence  of  the  Gods 
and,  believing  in  that  oath,  I  reinstated  her  in  my  house,  but 
great  indeed  was  the  public  condemnation,  therefore  I  sent 
Maithili  away.  O  Brahmin,  though  wholly  convinced  of  her 
innocence,  it  was  from  fear  of  the  people  that  I  cast  off  Sita,  do 
thou  pardon  me  !  I  acknowledge  these  twins,  Kusha  and  Lava, 
to  be  my  sons !  I  desire  to  make  my  peace  with  the  chaste 
Maithili  amidst  the  assembly." 

Hearing  of  his  intention,  the  foremost  of  the  Gods,  led  by 

Brahma,  all  assembled  there  to  witness  Sita's  defence,  and 

Adityas,  Vasus,  Rudras,  Vishvadevas,  the  hosts  of  the  Maruts 

and  all  the  great  Rishis,  Nagas,  Sadhyas,  Suparnas  and  Siddhas 

616 


UTTARA    KANDA 

gathered  with  delight.  Beholding  the  Gods  and  the  Sages,  the 
foremost  of  men,  Raghava,  once  more  affirmed :  "  I  am  in 
agreement  with  the  irreproachable  words  of  the  Rishi  Valmiki ! 
I  wish  to  be  reconciled  with  the  chaste  Vaidehi  in  the  presence  of 
this  assembly." 

The  defence  of  Sita  filled  all  who  witnessed  it  with  emotion 
and,  at  that  moment,  Vayu,  the  foremost  of  the  Gods,  sent  forth 
a  pure  and  fragrant  breeze  to  the  great  delight  of  the  assembly, 
as  formerly  in  the  Golden  Age,  and,  it  appeared  marvellous  to  all 
those  people  from  many  lands  who  experienced  it ! 

Beholding  that  assembly,  Sita,  attired  in  a  yellow  robe,  with 
joined  palms,  her  head  bowed,  her  eyes  lowered,  said  : — 

"  If,  in  thought,  I  have  never  dwelt  on  any  but  Rama,  may  the 
Goddess  Madhavi1  receive  me  !  " 

As  Vaidehi  was  still  speaking,  a  miracle  took  place  and,  from 
the  earth  rose  a  marvellous  celestial  throne  supported  on  the 
heads  of  Nagas  of  immeasurable  power,  their  bodies  adorned 
with  divine  gems.  The  Goddess  Dharani,  bidding  her  welcome, 
took  Maithili  in  her  arms,  causing  her  to  be  seated  on  that 
celestial  seat  and,  while  she  occupied  the  throne,  a  shower  of 
blossoms  fell  without  ceasing  from  the  sky.  Then  the  Gods 
burst  into  loud  acclamations,  crying  "  Excellent !  Excellent ! 
O  Sita,  thy  virtue  is  supreme  !  " 

From  the  heavens,  the  Gods,  with  delighted  hearts,  beholding 
Sita  descend  into  the  earth,  praised  her  again  and  again,  and  at 
the  place  of  sacrifice,  where  all  were  assembled,  Sages,  kings  and 
the  foremost  of  men  were  unable  to  recover  from  their  astonish- 
ment. In  the  sky,  on  earth  and  in  the  nether  regions,  all  beings, 
animate  and  inanimate,  Danavas  of  vast  stature  and  the  foremost 
of  the  Pannagas  cried  out  in  delight,  whilst  others  remained 
absorbed  in  their  thoughts  or  gazed  on  Rama  and  on  Sita  in 
ecstasy.  The  entire  assembly  witnessed  Sita's  descent  into  the 
earth  and,  at  that  moment,  a  great  tremor  passed  through  the 
whole  world.

THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

CHAPTER     98 

Rama's  Anger  and  Grief,  Brahma  appeases  him 

When  Vaidchi  had  descended  into  the  earth,  all  the  monkeys 
and  Sages  cried  out  in  Rama's  presence, "  Excellent !  Excellent" 
but  Rama,  deeply  distressed,  supporting  himself  on  a  staff 
employed  in  the  sacrifice,  his  eyes  veiled  with  tears,  his  head 
bowed,  was  overcome  with  grief.  Sighing  again  and  again, 
letting  fall  many  tears,  a  prey  to  pain  and  wrath,  he  said  : — 

"  Beholding  Sita,  the  personification  of  Shri,  vanish  in  my 
presence,  my  soul  experiences  an  agony  hitherto  unknown. 
Formerly,  when  she  was  in  Lanka,  on  the  further  side  of  the 
vast  ocean,  I  brought  her  back,  how  much  more  easily  shall  I 
be  able  to  wrest  her  from  the  bosom  of  the  earth  !  O  Goddess 
Vasuda,  give  me  back  my  Sita,  whom  thou  retainest,  or  thou 
shalt  witness  my  wrath !  Thou  shouldst  know  me  since  thou 
art  assuredly  my  mother-in-law  and  Maithili  rose  from  thee 
when  Janaka  was  following  the  plough.  Therefore  let  Sita  go  or 
open  thyself  to  me  that  I  may  dwell  with  her  in  Patala  or  else  in 
Nakaprishtha  !  Bring  back  Maithili  on  whose  account  I  am 
distraught !  If  thou  failest  to  return  Sita  to  me  in  her  original 
form,  I  shall  plough  thee  up  with  thy  mountains  and  forests  and 
shall  destroy  thee  so  that  nothing  but  water  remains  !  " 

Thus  spoke  Kakutstha,  full  of  wrath  and  grief,  and  Brahma, 
accompanied  by  the  Hosts  of  the  Gods,  addressed  the  son  of 
Raghu,  saying : — 

"  O  Rama,  virtuous  Rama,  do  not  be  incensed,  recollect  thy 
divine  origin  and  nature,  O  Scourge  of  Thy  Foes  !  Assuredly, 
O  Prince,  I  do  not  need  to  remind  thee  that  no-one  is  superior 
to  thee !  Now  recall  that  thou  art  Vishnu,  O  Invincible  Hero ! 
The  chaste  and  virtuous  Sita,  who  was  wholly  absorbed  in  thee 
formerly,  has  happily  reached  the  region  of  the  Nagas,  by  virtue 
of  her  ascetic  practices.  Thou  wilt  undoubtedly  be  re-united 
with  her  in  the  Celestial  Realm.  O  Rama,  hear,  in  the  assembly, 
what  I  relate  in  this  poem,  the  most  beautiful  of  epics,  recited  in 
thine  honour,  I  will  make  all  known  to  thee  in  detail,  do  not 
6x8 


UTTARA    KANDA 

doubt  it.  In  this  poem  of  Valmiki  all  is  included  from  the  time 
of  thy  birth,  O  Hero,  the  good  and  evil  that  has  visited  thee  and 
what  will  happen  in  the  future.  That  great  poet,  O  Rama,  is 
wholly  devoted  to  thee,  none  other  is  worthy  of  the  honour 
bestowed  by  poets  save  Raghava.  Formerly,  in  company  with 
the  Gods,  I  heard  the  entire  classic ;  it  is  divine,  marvellously 
beautiful,  true,  and  the  remover  of  nescience.  O  Foremost  of 
Men,  O  Supremely  Virtuous  Kakutstha,  listen  to  the  conclusion 
of  the  Ramayana  and  what  concerns  the  future.  Listen  now  with 
the  Rishis,  O  Doughty  and  Illustrious  Prince,  to  the  end  of  this 
sublime  poem  entitled  'Uttara'.  Assuredly,  O  Kakutstha,  this 
excellent  epilogue  may  not  be  heard  by  any  other  save  thee,  who 
art  the  supreme  Sage,  O  Hero,  O  Joy  of  the  House  of  Raghu." 

Having  spoken  thus,  Brahma,  the  Lord  of  the  Three  Worlds, 
returned  to  his  abode  with  his  followers,  the  Gods. 

Meantime  the  magnanimous  and  high-souled  Rishis,  whose 
abode  was  Brahmaloka,  at  Brahma's  command,  remained, 
desirous  of  hearing  *  Uttara  kanda '  and  what  should  happen  to 
Raghava. 

Having  listened  to  the  significant  words  of  that  God  of  Gods, 
the  illustrious  Rama  said  to  Valmiki : — 

"  O  Blessed  One,  the  Rishis  of  Brahmaloka  desire  to  listen  to 
*  Uttara  kanda '  and  all  that  shall  happen  to  me ;  to-morrow  let  it 
be  narrated  by  thee !  " 

Having  resolved  thus,  Rama  sought  out  Kusha  and  Lava  and, 
dismissing  the  company,  returned  with  them  to  the  leaf-thatched 
hut  of  the  Rishi  Valmiki,  where  he  passed  the  night  lamenting 
for  Sita. 


CHAPTER     99 

The  Death  of  the  Queens 

When  night  had  given  way  to  dawn,  Rama  called  together  the 
great  ascetics  and  said  to  his  two  sons  : — 

M  Now  sing  without  anxiety,"  and  when  those  great  and 
magnanimous  Sages  were  seated,  Kusha  and  Lava  sang  the 
epilogue  to  the  'Ramayana.' 

619 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Sita,  having  re-entered  the  earth,  thus  proving  her  fidelity,  and 
the  sacrifice  being  completed,  Rama,  in  the  extremity  of  grief, 
not  beholding  Vaidehi,  regarded  the  world  as  a  desert,  and  he 
dismissed  the  kings,  bears,  monkeys  and  titans  and  the  host  of 
leading  brahmins,  having  loaded  them  with  treasure. 

Taking  leave  of  them,  the  lotus-eyed  Rama,  who  was  ever 
absorbed  in  the  thought  of  Sita,  returned  to  Ayodhya.  The  Joy 
of  the  House  of  Raghu  never  sought  another  consort  but,  in 
every  sacrifice,  he  set  up  a  golden  image  of  Janaki  in  her  stead. 
For  ten  thousand  years,  Rama  performed  the  Vajamedha 
Sacrifice  and  the  Vajapeya,  ten  times  more,  distributing  quantities 
of  gold,  and  that  fortunate  One  also  performed  the  Agnisthoma, 
Atiratra  and  Gosava  Sacrifices,  giving  away  abundant  charity. 
For  a  long  time,  the  magnanimous  Raghava  occupied  the 
throne,  his  heart  fixed  in  his  duty ;  bears,  monkeys  and  titans 
were  subject  to  his  rule  and  monarchs  came  daily  to  pay  him 
homage.  Parjanya  sent  rains  in  the  proper  season  and  it  was 
abundant,  the  skies  were  clear,  the  regions  sinless,  the  city  and 
country  abounding  in  cheerful  and  satisfied  people.  None  died 
prematurely  nor  was  there  any  disease,  and  in  Rama's  reign, 
none  were  destitute. 

After  many  years  however,  Rama's  aged  mother,  surrounded 
by  her  sons  and  grandsons,  passed  away  and  she  was  followed 
by  Sumitra  and  the  renowned  Kaikeyi,  who  having  performed 
many  righteous  acts  went  to  the  celestial  region,  where  those 
happy  Ones  were  re-united  with  Dasaratha  and  received  the 
fruit  of  their  merit  in  heaven. 

From  time  to  time,  in  memory  of  his  mother,  Raghava 
distributed  gifts  to  the  brahmins  vowed  to  asceticism,  and  the 
virtuous  Rama  offered  up  obsequies  accompanied  by  gifts  of 
gems  to  the  Sages  and  performed  incomparable  austerities  in 
honour  of  his  ancestors. 

Thus  thousands  of  years  passed  happily  during  which,  with 
the  aid  of  sacrifices,  that  prince  promoted  the  execution  of  duty 
in  all  its  aspects. 


UTTARA     KANDA 

CHAPTER     100 

Rama  sends  Bkarata  to  conquer  the  Gandharvas 

One  day,  Yudhajita,  the  King  of  Kaikaya,  sent  his  spiritual 
Preceptor,  Gargya,  the  son  of  Angiras,  a  Brahmarishi  of  im- 
measurable glory,  to  the  magnanimous  Raghava,  with  ten 
thousand  horses  as  a  token  of  his  unsurpassed  affection,  and  also 
carpets,  gems,  diverse  splendid  stuffs  and  brilliant  ornaments ; 
such  were  the  gifts  bestowed  on  Rama  by  that  monarch. 

Hearing  of  the  arrival  of  that  great  Rishi  Gargya  with  those 
magnificent  presents  from  Ashwapati,  his  maternal  uncle,  the 
virtuous  Raghava  went  out  with  his  suite  to  meet  him  to  the 
distance  of  a  mile,  and  he  offered  homage  to  him,  as  Shakra  pays 
obeisance  to  Brihaspati. 

Having  paid  salutations  to  the  Rishi  and  accepted  the  gifts,  he 
enquired  of  him  fully  regarding  the  welfare  of  his  mother's 
brother  and  family.  Ushering  the  blessed  Rishi  into  his  palace, 
Rama  began  to  question  him,  saying : — 

"  What  message  has  my  uncle  confided  to  thee  in  sending 
thee  hither  ?  " 

Having  come  there,  that  great  Rishi,  hearing  Rama's  words, 
unfolded  his  mission  in  eloquent  terms,  saying  : — 

"This,  O  Long-armed  Hero,  is  what  thy  maternal  uncle, 
Yudhajita,  in  his  affection  for  thee,  requests  thee  to  hear.  There 
is  a  country  of  the  Gandharvas,  rich  in  fruit  and  roots,  situated 
on  the  banks  of  the  Sindhu  River ;  that  country  is  extremely 
fertile.  The  Gandharvas,  armed  and  skilful  warriors,  defend  it. 
When  thou  hast  conquered  them,  O  Virtuous  Kakutstha  and 
destroyed  their  magnificent  citadels,  take  possession  of  their 
cities,  which  are  well  constructed.  None  other  can  achieve  this  ; 
the  country  is  extremely  beautiful ;  do  thou  follow  my  counsel, 
it  is  to  thine  advantage." 

This  speech  of  his  uncle's,  conveyed  by  the  great  Rishi, 
pleased  Raghava  who  replied  "  So  be  it ! "  and  he  glanced  at 
Bharata ;  thereafter,  delighted,  Raghava,  with  joined  palms, 
spoke  again  to  that  Twice-born,  saying : — 

"  These  two  youthful  princes  will  explore  the  country,  O 
621 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Brahmarishi !  Bharata  is  the  father  of  these  valiant  youths, 
Taksha  and  Pushkala.  Under  the  protection  of  my  uncle,  they 
will  show  themselves  to  be  devoted  in  the  discharge  of  their 
duty.  With  Bharata  at  their  head,  those  two  youthful  princes, 
accompanied  by  their  troops,  will  slay  the  sons  of  the  Gand- 
harvas  and  take  possession  of  the  two  cities.  Having  subdued 
those  two  great  capitals  and  installed  his  two  sons,  my  very 
virtuous  brother  will  return  once  more." 

Thus  did  Rama  speak  to  that  Brahmarishi,  and  thereafter 
issued  orders  to  Bharata  to  start  out  with  his  army,  having  first 
installed  those  youthful  princes. 

Under  the  constellation  Saumya,1  preceded  by  the  son  of 
Angiras,  Bharata  set  out  with  his  troops  and  his  two  sons,  and  it 
seemed  as  if  that  army,  leaving  Ayodhya,  followed  to  a  great 
distance  by  Raghava,  could  not  have  been  approached  even  by 
the  Gods  themselves.  Then  those  beings  who  live  on  flesh,  and 
titans  of  colossal  stature,  followed  in  Bharata's  train,  thirsting 
for  blood,  and  the  redoubtable  Bhutagramas,  in  their  desire  to 
devour  the  corpses  of  the  Gandharvas,  came  in  hundreds  and 
thousands,  and  lions,  tigers,  boars  and  birds  in  countless  numbers 
preceded  the  troops.  In  a  month  and  a  half,  that  army  composed 
of  cheerful  and  healthy  warriors  reached  the  Kingdom  of  Kaikeya. 


CHAPTER     101 

The  slaying  of  the  Gandharvas  and  the  conquest  of  their  Country 

Hearing  of  the  arrival  of  Bharata  at  the  head  of  a  vast  army 
accompanied  by  Gargya,  the  King  of  the  Kaikeyas,  Yudhajita, 
experienced  supreme  joy  and  set  out  in  all  haste  with  a  great 
company  against  the  Gandharvas. 

Bharata  and  Yudhajita,  having  joined  forces,  approached  the 
City  of  the  Gandharvas  with  their  swift  troops  and  followers, 
whereupon,  learning  of  the  invasion,  the  Gandharvas  assembled, 
eager  for  combat,  full  of  vigour  and  shouting  on  every  side. 

Then  a  terrible  battle  of  appalling  violence  ensued,  lasting 
seven  days,  without  victory  being  decisive  for  either  army.

Rivers  of  blood,  floating  with  corpses,  streamed  on  every  side, 
scimitars  and  spears  being  the  crocodiles.  Thereafter  Bharata, 
the  younger  brother  of  Rama,  enraged,  loosed  a  terrible  shaft 
propelled  by  mantras,  named  Samvarta,1  on  the  Gandharvas. 
Caught  in  the  noose  of  destruction,  three  hundred  thousand 
Gandharvas  were  slain  in  an  instant,  cut  to  pieces  by  that  hero. 
The  inhabitants  of  the  Celestial  Region  were  unable  to  remember 
such  a  fearful  conflict  in  which,  in  the  twinkling  of  an  eye,  so 
vast  a  number  of  warriors  perished. 

The  Gandharvas  all  being  slain,  Bharata,  the  son  of  Kaikeyi 
entered  those  two  opulent  and  magnificent  cities,  and  there, 
Bharata  established  Taksha  in  Takshashila  and  Pushkala  in 
Pushkalavata,  in  the  country  of  the  Gandharvas,  in  the  ravishing 
region  of  Gandhara.  Overflowing  with  treasure  and  precious 
gems,  adorned  with  groves,  they  seemed  to  vie  with  each  other 
in  magnificence. 

For  five  years  the  long-armed  Bharata,  son  of  Kaikeyi, 
occupied  those  capitals  of  supreme  beauty,  whose  inhabitants 
were  of  irreproachable  conduct,  and  thereafter  he  returned  to 
Ayodhya.  Those  cities  with  their  innumerable  parks,  filled  with 
vehicles  and  well-stocked  markets,  enchanting  beyond  imagining, 
were  embellished  by  fabulous  buildings  and  countless  palaces, 
resplendent  with  a  multitude  of  magnificent  temples  and  adorned 
with  Tala,  Tamala,  Tilaka,  and  Bakula  Trees. 

Then  the  fortunate  Bharata  paid  obeisance  to  the  magnani- 
mous Raghava,  who  was  Dharma  personified,  as  Vasava  offers 
salutations  to  Brahma,  and  Raghava  listened  with  satisfaction 
when  Bharata  told  him  of  the  total  extermination  of  the  Gand- 
harvas which  had  taken  place  and  of  the  occupation  of  their 
territory. 

CHAPTER     X02 

Rama  bestows  Kingdoms  on  Lakshmana's  Sons 

Hearing  those  tidings,  Rama  with  his  brothers  rejoiced  and  he 
uttered  these  memorable  words  in  their  presence : — 
"Thy  two  youthful  sons,  Angada  and  Chandraketu,  are 

1  Samvarta — A  weapon  with  which  Kala  or  Time  destroys  the  worlds. 

623 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

worthy  to  reign,  O  Saumitri,  for  they  are  strong  and  energetic ; 
I  shall  install  them  both  as  Icings  !  Come,  find  these  two  valiant 
Ones  a  pleasant  region  which  is  not  confined,  where  there  is  no 
danger  of  treachery  from  hostile  monarchs,  where  they  may  live 
at  ease  and  where  the  ascetics'  retreats  are  not  despoiled !  O 
Friend,  seek  out  such  a  country  without  causing  injury  to  any  !  " 

Thus  spoke  Rama,  and  Bharata  answered  : — 

"  There  is  a  charming  and  healthy  region  named  Karupatta  ; 
let  two  cities  that  are  salubrious  and  beautiful  be  established 
there  for  the  magnanimous  Angada  and  Chandraketu  which 
shall  be  called  Angadiya  and  Chandrakanta." 

These  words  of  Bharata  were  approved  by  Raghava,  and  he 
brought  that  country  under  his  rule  and  established  Angada 
therein.  The  City  of  Angadiya  was  built  for  Angada  by  Rama  of 
imperishable  deeds  and  it  was  splendid  and  well  fortified.  As 
for  Chandraketu,  who  was  a  giant,  his  uncle  built  Chandrakanta 
for  him  in  the  country  of  the  Mallas,1  and  that  capital  was 
celestial  and  equal  to  Amaravati. 

Thereafter,  greatly  delighted,  Rama,  Lakshmana  and  Bharata, 
those  invincible  warriors,  attended  the  installation  of  those  two 
youthful  princes  who,  having  received  the  divine  unction,  fixed 
in  their  duty,  divided  the  territory,  and  Angada  had  the  western 
and  Chandraketu  the  northern  region.  Angada  was  accompanied 
by  Sumitra's  son,8  whilst  Lakshmana  and  Bharata  followed  in 
Chandraketu's  train. 

His  sons  being  firmly  established  on  the  throne,  Lakshmana 
took  the  road  back  to  Ayodhya,  having  sojourned  in  Angadiya 
for  a  year.  On  his  side,  Bharata  remained  with  Chandraketu 
one  year  more,  thereafter  returning  to  Ayodhya  to  take  up  his 
place  again  at  Rama's  feet. 

Both  Saumitri  and  Bharata,  in  their  love  for  him  and  their 
extreme  piety,  forgot  that  rime  was  passing  and  thus  ten  thousand 
years  went  by  while  they  devoted  themselves  to  affairs  of  state. 
Employing  their  days  in  this  wise,  their  hearts  satisfied,  sur- 
rounded with  splendour,  dwelling  together  in  that  righteous 
city,  they  resembled  the  Three  Fires  whose  flames  are  fed  with 
abundant  libations  amidst  great  solemnity.

CHAPTER     103 

Death  is  sent  to  seek  out  Rama 


After  a  long  time,  Death,  in  the  form  of  an  ascetic,  presented 
himself  at  the  gates  of  the  great  and  virtuous  Rama  and  said : — 

"  I  am  a  messenger  from  an  all-powerful  Maharishi  and  have 
come  to  see  Rama  on  a  matter  of  great  importance." 

Hearing  these  words,  Saumitri  hastened  to  announce  the 
arrival  of  the  ascetic  to  Rama,  saying : — 

"  Mayest  thou  extend  thy  dominion  over  both  worlds,  O 
Illustrious  Prince  !  A  Messenger  has  come  to  see  thee,  who,  by 
virtue  of  his  penances,  is  as  radiant  as  the  sun." 

Hearing  Lakshmana's  words,  Rama  said  : — 

"  Bring  in  that  ascetic  of  great  effulgence,  who  carries  a 
message  from  his  master,  O  Dear  Brother  !  " 

Then  Saumitri  answered  :  "  Be  it  so  !  "  and  ushered  in  that 
Sage,  flaming  in  splendour,  surrounded  as  it  were  with  burning 
rays.  Approaching  the  foremost  of  the  Raghus,  who  shone  in 
his  own  effulgence,  the  Rishi,  in  an  harmonious  voice,  addressed 
Raghava,  saying : — "  May  felicity  be  thine !  " 

Then  the  supremely  illustrious  Rama,  having  paid  him  the 
traditional  homage  and  offered  him  the  Arghya,  enquired  of  him 
concerning  his  state.  Having  informed  Rama  of  his  well- 
being,  the  most  skilled  of  orators,  that  illustrious  ascetic  seated 
himself  on  a  golden  throne  and  thereafter  Rama  said  to  him : — 

"  Be  thou  welcome,  O  Great  Sage,  what  message  hast  thou 
for  me,  since  thou  dost  come  as  an  ambassador  ?  " 

On  this  enquiry  from  that  Lion  among  Men,  the  Sage  said 
to  him: — 

"  If  thou  dost  revere  the  wishes  of  the  Gods,  this  meeting  must 
take  place  between  us  alone ;  whoever  shall  overhear  us  should 
be  put  to  death  by  thee ;  the  words  of  the  Lord  of  the  Ascetics 
are  secret  and  should  be  revered  by  Thee." 

"  Be  it  so  !  "  replied  Rama,  and  having  given  this  assurance, 
he  issued  the  following  command  to  Lakshmana  : — 

"  Do  thou  stand  at  the  door,  O  Long-armed  Warrior  and 
625 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

dismiss  the  door-keeper.  It  is  for  me  to  slay  whoever  hears  the 
converse  between  this  Muni  and  myself,  for  it  must  take  place 
between  us  alone." 

Having  sent  Lakshmana  to  guard  the  door,  Kakutstha,  born 
of  Raghu,  said  : — 

"  O  Ascetic,  thou  canst  now  disclose  that  with  which  thou  hast 
been  charged,  speak  without  fear,  I  shall  treasure  it  in  my  heart !"" 


CHAPTER     104 

Death  delivers  his  Message 

"  Learn,  O  Magnanimous  Sovereign,  that  this  is  the  purpose  of 
my  coming !  It  is  the  blessed  Grandsire  who  has  sent  me,  O 
Mighty  Prince.  I  was  his  son  in  a  former  existence,  O  Con- 
queror of  Hostile  Citadels  !  Born  of  Maya,  O  Hero,  I  am  Death 
who  destroys  all !  The  Grandsire,  Lord  of  the  Worlds,  speaks 
thus  to  thee : — 

"  '  Thy  task  is  accomplished,  O  Friend,  O  Protector  of  the 
Worlds !  Having  formerly  destroyed  all  beings  by  the  aid  of 
Maya,  lying  amidst  the  waters  of  the  vast  ocean,  thou  didst  give 
me  birth.  Thou  hadst  already  created  the  Serpent  of  large  coils, 
Ananta,  as  also  two  mighty  Beings,  Madhu  and  Kaitabha,  whose 
crushed  bones  covered  the  earth  which  appeared  at  that  time 
with  its  chain  of  mountains.  From  a  celestial  lotus,  bright  as  the 
sun,  that  issued  from  thy  navel,  thou  didst  produce  me  and  give 
me  the  task  of  creating  the  world.  Since  thou  hast  charged  me 
with  this  burden,  I  lean  on  thee  for  support,  O  Lord  of  the 
Earth !  Do  thou  watch  over  all  beings,  for  it  is  thou  who  art  my 
strength.  By  virtue  of  thine  invincible  and  eternal  nature,  thou 
shouldst  afford  protection  to  all  creation,  for  thou  hast  assumed 
the  form  of  Vishnu  !  O  Mighty  Son  of  Adit i,  thou  didst  enhance 
the  power  of  thy  brothers  and  when  they  sought  to  accomplish 
their  tasks,  thou  didst  come  to  their  aid.  When,  O  Prince,  all 
creatures  were  being  exterminated  by  Ravana,  thou,  desiring  to 
slay  him,  bethought  thyself  of  men.  Then  thou  didst  resolve 
to  dwell  among  them  in  person  for  eleven  thousand  years  and 
626 


UTTARA    KANDA 

thereafter  return  to  us.  Thou,  who  art  mind-born,  hast  com- 
pleted thy  stay  among  mortals;  it  is  the  hour,  O  Foremost  of 
Men,  to  return  to  us  ;  if  it  is  thy  desire  to  prolong  thy  sojourn 
among  creatures,  O  Great  King,  do  so  and  be  happy  !  * 

"  Such  are  the  words  of  the  Grandsire : — *  If  thou  preferest 
to  enter  into  possession  of  the  world  of  the  Gods  once  more,  O 
Raghava,  they  with  their  leaders  will  be  freed  from  all  anxiety, 
since  Vishnu  will  be  amongst  them.'  " 

Having  heard  the  words  of  the  Grandsire,  which  Death 
communicated  to  him,  Raghava,  smiling,  answered  the  Destroyer 
of  the  Worlds,  saying : — 

"  These  wholly  admirable  words  of  that  God  of  Gods  assuredly 
causes  me  supreme  delight,  as  also  thy  coming  hither.  I  came 
for  the  good  of  the  worlds,  this  is  the  purpose  of  my  being ; 
mayest  thou  be  happy !  Thine  advent  here  has  moved  my 
heart ;  I  shall  leave  without  delay.  The  Grandsire  has  uttered 
what  is  true,  I  must  attend  to  all  that  concerns  the  Gods  under 
my  dominion,  O  Destroyer  of  the  Universe !  " 


chapter    105 

The  Sage  Durvasa  comes  to  visit  Rama 

As  the  two  were  conversing  thus,  Durvasa,  that  blessed  Sage, 
who  wished  to  see  Rama,  came  to  the  gate  of  the  palace  and, 
approaching  Saumitri,  that  illustrious  ascetic  said  : — 

"  Bring  me  straightway  into  Rama's  presence,  the  affair  is 
urgent ! " 

So  spoke  the  magnanimous  Sage,  and  Lakshmana,  the  Slayer 
of  His  Foes,  bowing  low,  said  to  him : — 

"  What  is  this  matter  ?  Explain  thyself,  O  Blessed  Sage! 
What  can  I  do  for  thee  ?  Raghava  is  occupied,  O  Brahmin,  have 
patience  awhile ! " 

Hearing  this  reply  from  that  lion  among  men,  the  great  Rishi, 
highly  incensed,  said  to  Lakshmana,  whom  he  seemed  to  consume 
with  his  glance : — 

"Announce  my  presence  here  to  Rama  immediately,  O 
627 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Saumitri,  or 1  shall  pronounce  a  curse  on  the  kingdom,  on  thee, 
the  city,  on  Raghava,  Bharata  and  on  thy  House !  O  Saumitri, 
I  can  no  longer  contain  mine  indignation  !  " 

Having  heard  the  mighty  ascetic's  alarming  words,  Lakshmana 
pondered  awhile  within  himself  concerning  their  significance, 
and  reflected : — 

"It  were  better  that  I  should  perish  than  all  others  be 
destroyed ! " 

On  this,  he  made  the  arrival  of  the  ascetic  known  to  Raghava 
and,  Rama  hearing  the  tidings,  took  leave  of  Death  and,  in  all 
haste,  sought  out  the  son  of  Atri.  Having  paid  obeisance  with 
joined  palms  to  that  great  Sage  flaming  in  effulgence,  he 
enquired  of  him,  saying : — 

"  What  may  I  do  for  thee  ?  " 

On  this  enquiry  from  that  King  of  Ascetics,  the  Sage  Durvasa 
answered : — 

"  O  Virtuous  Rama,  hear  me,  this  day  I  have  concluded  a  fast 
of  a  thousand  years.  O  Irreproachable  Raghava,  now  give  me 
what  thou  hast  ready  to  eat !  " 

At  these  words,  the  King  Raghava,  with  a  delighted  heart, 
offered  the  foremost  of  Sages  dishes,  that  had  been  made  ready, 
and  that  ascetic,  having  partaken  of  that  food  like  unto  Amrita, 
addressed  Rama,  saying : — 

"  It  is  well !  "  and  returned  to  his  hermitage. 

Thereafter  Rama  called  to  mind  the  words  of  Death  at  that 
portentous  meeting  and,  with  bowed  head,  his  heart  wrung  with 
anguish,  he  was  unable  to  speak.  Reflecting  again  and  again 
within  himself,  the  illustrious  Raghava  thought,  "All  is  lost !  " 
and  fell  silent. 


chapter    i 06 

Rama  banishes  Lakshmana 

Seeing  Rama,  his  head  bowed,  afflicted  and  like  unto  the  moon 
in  eclipse,  Lakshmana  spoke  to  him  in  cheerful  and  affectionate 
tones,  saying  : — 
"  Thou  shouldst  not  grieve  on  mine  account,  O  Long-armed 
628 


UTTARA    KANDA 

Warrior ;  thus  was  it  already  ordained  and  has  its  roots  in  a  past 
cause !  Slay  me  without  hesitation,  be  faithful  to  thy  vow ! 
Those  who  do  not  honour  their  promise,  go  to  hell !  If  thou  hast 
any  affection  for  me,  O  Great  King,  and  dost  find  any  merit  in 
me,  then  3lay  me  and  fulfil  the  law,  O  Raghava  !  " 

Thus  spoke  Lakshmana,  and  Rama,  his  mind  troubled,  called 
his  ministers  and  priests  together  and  told  them  what  had  taken 
place,  of  the  arrival  of  Durvasa  and  the  vow  he  had  made  to  the 
Ascetic.  When  they  had  heard  these  things,  the  ministers  and 
brahmins  became  silent,  nevertheless  the  illustrious  Vasishtha 
spoke  thus : — 

"  O  Long-armed  Prince,  I  perceive  that  the  separation  from 
Lakshmana  is  for  thee  a  calamity,  causing  thy  hair  to  stand  on 
end.  O  Illustrious  Rama,  do  thou  abandon  him ;  death  is 
powerful,  let  not  thy  words  prove  false.  When  a  promise  is  not 
honoured  and  virtue  is  destroyed,  undoubtedly  the  Three  Worlds 
with  all  animate  and  inanimate  beings,  with  the  hosts  of  the 
Gods  and  Rishis,  perish  !  Therefore,  O  Lion  among  Men,  in 
order  to  save  the  Three  Worlds  and  assure  the  continuance  of  the 
universe,  banish  Lakshmana !  " 

Hearing  these  words,  which  were  in  accord  with  duty  and 
righteousness,  approved  by  all,  Rama,  in  the  midst  of  the  assem- 
bly, said  to  Lakshmana : — 

"  Lest  righteousness  should  perish,  I  banish  thee,  O  Saumitri, 
a  sentence  of  banishment  or  death  is  the  same  to  men  of  honour  !" 

At  this  decree  of  Rama's,  Lakshmana,  weeping,  his  mind 
distracted,  departed  in  all  haste  without  returning  to  his  home. 

Having  reached  the  banks  of  the  Sarayu  River,  he  performed 
his  ablutions  and,  with  joined  palms,  closing  the  doors  of  the 
senses,  he  began  to  meditate.  As  he  was  thus  restraining  his 
senses,  he  did  not  release  his  breath  while  given  up  to  contem- 
plation, and  the  Gods  with  their  leaders,  the  troops  of  Apsaras 
and  companies  of  Rishis  covered  him  with  a  rain  of  flowers. 
Becoming  invisible  to  men,  the  mighty  Lakshmana  was  borne 
away  in  the  body  by  Shakra,  who  carried  him  to  the  Celestial 
Region.  Beholding  the  fourth  pact  of  Vishnu  entering  heaven, 
the  foremost  of  the  Gods,  delighted,  joyfully  and  unitedly 
offered  homage  to  that  descendant  of  Raghu.

CHAPTER     107 

Rama  installs  Kusha  and  Lava  on  the  Throne 

Having  banished  Lakshmana,  Rama,  a  prey  to  grief  and  deso- 
lation, said  to  his  priests,  ministers  and  citizens  : — 

"  To-day  I  shall  give  the  royal  annointing  to  the  valiant 
Bharata,  who  is  faithful  to  his  duty,  and  make  him  Lord  of 
Ayodhya  ;  thereafter  I  shall  go  to  the  forest.  Make  all  prepara- 
tions, lose  no  time,  for  to-day  I  too  shall  follow  the  path  that 
Lakshmana  has  taken  !  " 

Thus  spoke  Raghava  and  his  subjects  bowed  low  as  if  deprived 
of  all  strength.  On  his  side,  Bharata,  beside  himself  on  hearing 
his  brother's  speech,  refused  the  crown  and  expressed  himself 
thus:— 

"  I  swear  in  truth,  O  King,  without  thee  I  do  not  wish  to 
reign,  even  in  Svarga,  O  Thou,  the  Joy  of  the  Raghus !  Estab- 
lish thy  two  sons,  the  valiant  Kusha  and  Lava  in  the  Southern 
Koshalas  and  the  Northern  Regions;  send  swift  messengers  to 
Shatrughna  to  announce  our  departure,  let  there  be  no  delay ! " 

Hearing  these  words  of  Bharata  and  also  beholding  the 
citizens  who,  their  heads  bowed,  were  overwhelmed  with  grief, 
Vasishtha  spoke : — 

"  O  Beloved  Rama,  see  how  these  people  are  prostrating 
themselves,  having  learnt  what  they  desire,  fulfill  it,  do  not 
grieve  them !  ** 

Thus  spoke  Vasishtha  and  Kakutstha,  having  caused  them  to 
rise,  said  to  the  people,  "  What  is  asked  of  me  ?  "  and  they  all 
said  to  him  : — 

"  If  thou  art  leaving  us,  let  us  accompany  thee  wheresoever 
thou  goest,  O  Rama ;  if  thou  dost  love  thy  subjects  and  that 
affection  is  unsurpassed,  let  us,  with  our  sons  and  wives,  follow 
the  righteous  path  with  thee ;  whether  it  be  to  an  inaccessible 
retreat,  river  or  ocean,  thou  shouldst  not  abandon  us ;  lead  us  all 
wherever  thou  wilt,  O  Thou  our  Master  !  This  is  our  supreme 
desire,  our  most  cherished  wish ;  it  will  always  be  the  delight  of 
our  hearts  to  accompany  thee,  O  Prince  1  " 
630 


UTTARA    KANDA 

Recognizing  his  people's  profound  attachment,  Rama 
answered, "  So  be  it !  "  and  occupied  himself  in  carrying  through 
what  he  had  undertaken  that  day. 

He  gave  over  the  Southern  Koshalas  to  the  valiant  Kusha  and 
those  of  the  north  to  Lava ;  thereafter,  placing  those  two  princes 
on  his  lap,  he  enthroned  them  in  Ayodhya  and  bestowed  upon 
them  thousands  of  chariots  and  numberless  elephants  with  ten 
thousand  horses.  Having  furnished  them  with  jewels  and 
treasure  in  abundance  and  given  them  cheerful  and  healthy 
people  to  attend  upon  them,  he  sent  the  two  brothers,  Kusha 
and  Lava,  each  to  his  own  capital. 

Those  two  heroes  being  installed  in  their  respective  cities, 
Rama  sent  out  an  emissary  to  the  magnanimous  Shatrughna.

Rama  issues  his  last  Commands 

The  messengers,  urged  on  by  Rama's  command,  swiftly  and 
promptly  went  to  Madhura  without  halting  on  the  way.  After 
three  nights  they  reached  that  city  where  they  all  informed 
Shatrughna  what  had  happened  ;  the  banishing  of  Lakshmana, 
Raghava's  vow,  the  installation  of  his  two  sons  and  the  resolution 
of  his  subjects  to  follow  him  ;  how  an  enchanting  city  had  been 
built  for  Kusha  under  the  name  of  Kushavati  on  the  high  ridge 
of  the  Vindhya  Mountains  by  the  virtuous  Rama,  and  that 
Shravasti  was  the  name  of  the  ravishing  and  famous  capital  of 
Lava  ;  they  told  him  also  of  the  preparations  made  by  Raghava 
and  Bharata  to  take  all  the  people  from  Ayodhya  and  enter 
Svarga. 

Having  related  all  these  things  to  the  magnanimous  Shatrugh- 
na, the  messengers  became  silent  and  thereafter  added,  "  Make 
all  haste,  O  King  !  " 

Hearing  these  fearful  tidings  regarding  the  imminent  destruc- 
tion of  his  entire  House,  Shatrughna,  the  Joy  of  Raghu,  called 
his  people  together  and  summoned  his  family  priest,  Kanchana, 
in  order  to  impart  the  truth  to  them  of  his  immediate  departure 
with  his  brothers. 

631 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

Thereafter,  that  valiant  prince  installed  his  two  sons,  having 
distributed  abundant  wealth  equally  amongst  them,  and  Subahu 
was  established  in  Madhura  and  Shatrughatin  in  Vaidisha. 
This  being  accomplished,  that  descendant  of  Raghu  left  for 
Ayodhya  in  a  single  chariot. 

There  he  beheld  the  magnanimous  Rama  like  unto  a  flaming 
brazier,  clothed  in  a  robe  of  fine  wool,  in  the  midst  of  the  im- 
perishable Sages.  Paying  obeisance  to  them  with  joined  palms, 
his  senses  under  control,  he  addressed  his  virtuous  brother, 
whose  thought  too  was  ever  fixed  on  his  duty,  and  said  : — 

"  I  have  enthroned  my  two  sons,  O  King,  and  have  come 
hither ;  know  well  that  I  am  resolved  to  follow  thee !  Do  not 
oppose  me,  O  Valiant  One,  for  I  would  not  that  thy  will  should 
be  disregarded  by  one  like  me." 

Seeing  his  resolve  was  fixed,  Rama  said  to  Shatrughna,  "  So 
be  it." 

Having  ceased  from  speaking,  the  monkeys,  who  were  able  to 
change  their  form  at  will,  with  the  companies  of  bears  and  titans 
came  there  from  all  directions  with  Sugriva  at  their  head,  all 
being  united  in  their  desire  to  behold  Rama,  who  stood  with  his 
face  turned  towards  the  sky. 

Devas,  Rishis  and  Gandharvas  with  their  offspring,  hearing  of 
Rama's  intended  departure,  had  all  assembled,  saying : — 

"  We  have  come  here  to  follow  thee,  O  Prince !  To  leave  with- 
out us,  O  Rama  is  to  strike  us  down  with  the  Rod  of  Death." 

At  that  instant,  the  supremely  powerful  Sugriva,  bowing 
before  that  hero  in  accord  with  tradition,  addressed  him  with 
humility  and  said  : — 

"  Having  installed  the  virtuous  Angada,  O  Prince,  know  that 
I  have  come  hither  with  the  intention  of  accompanying  thee  !  " 

At  these  words,  the  illustrious  Kakutstha  smiling,  answered  : — 

"  So  be  it !  "  Thereafter  he  said  to  Bibishana,  the  King  of 
the  Rakshasas : — 

"As  long  as  people  exist,  O  Mighty  Lord  of  the  Rakshasas,  do 
thou  remain  in  Lanka.  As  long  as  the  moon  and  sun  continue 
to  shine  on  the  earth,  as  long  as  they  speak  of  me  in  the  world,  so 
long  shall  thine  empire  endure ;  this  is  the  will  of  thy  friend,  do 
thou  obey !  Govern  thy  people  according  to  justice  and  do 
not  question  this  further.  One  thing  more  I  wish  to  say  to  thee, 
632 


UTTARA    KANDA 

O  Mighty  Monarch  of  the  Rakshasas,  do  thou  worship  the 
Divinity  of  the  House  of  Ikshvaku,  the  Guide  of  the  Universe, 
Shri  Jagannath,  whom  the  Devas  themselves  with  their  leaders 
perpetually  adore." 

"  So  shall  it  be,"  answered  Bibishana,  and  Kakutstha  thereafter 
addressed  Hanuman,  saying  : — 

"  Resign  thyself  to  continuing  to  live,  do  not  render  my  will 
void.  As  long  as  my  story  is  told  in  the  world,  O  Foremost  of 
Monkeys,  so  long  mayest  thou  be  happy  and  remember  my 
words !  " 

Thereupon  Hanuman,  acquiescing  in  Rama's  utterance,  in 
his  delight,  said  : — 

"As  long  as  thy  purifying  history  is  circulated  in  the  world, 
so  long  O  Rama,  shall  I  remain  on  earth  submissive  to  thy  will !  " 

Then  Raghava  issued  the  same  command  to  Jambavan  and 
said : — 

"  Till  the  Kali  Yuga  begins,  continue  to  dwell  on  earth  !  " 

Thereafter,  addressing  all  the  other  bears  and  monkeys,  he 
said: — 

"  If  it  be  your  desire,  then  follow  me !  " 


chapter    109 

Rama's  Departure  for  the  Makaprasthana 

When  the  dawn  broke,  the  broad-chested  and  illustrious  Rama, 
whose  eyes  were  as  large  as  lotus  petals,  said  to  his  spiritual 
Preceptor : — 

"  Let  the  Agnihotra  burning  brighdy  with  the  Twice-born 
and  also  the  sacrificial  canopy  be  borne  in  advance  and  thou,  My 
Lord,  precede  them  on  this  great  journey." 

Thereupon  Vasishtha,  full  of  majesty,  performed  the  pres- 
cribed rituals  related  to  the  Mahaprasthana  without  omitting 
anything.  Then  Rama,  clothed  in  fine  silk,  invoking  Brahma 
and  reciting  the  Vedic  Mantras,  taking  Kusha  Grass  in  both  his 
hands,  set  out  for  the  Sarayu  River,  halting  from  time  to  time, 
silently  making  his  way  along  the  rough  path.    Radiant  as  the 

633 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

sun,  he  issued  from  his  palace  barefooted  and,  on  his  right, 
walked  Shri  Lakshrai  with  her  lotus,  on  his  left,  was  the  great 
Goddess  Vyavasaya1  and,  assuming  human  form,  his  innumerable 
arrows,  marvellous  bow  and  all  the  other  weapons  accompanied 
him.  The  Vedas,  in  the  persons  of  brahmins,  the  Holy  Gayatri, 
Protector  of  the  World,  the  sacred  syllable  "  aum  "  and  the 
invocation  "  Vashat "  followed  in  Rama's  train  as  also  the  great- 
souled  Rishis,  and  all  the  Deities  of  the  Earth  accompanied  that 
hero  to  the  open  gates  of  heaven. 

In  his  steps  trod  the  women  of  the  inner  apartments  with  the 
aged,  the  children,  servants,  eunuchs  and  personal  attendants. 
The  faithful  Bharata  with  his  wives  accompanied  by  Shatrughna 
followed  in  Rama's  train,  attended  by  the  sacrificial  fire.  All 
the  magnanimous  Sages  with  the  ritualistic  articles,  having 
assembled  there  with  their  sons  and  wives,  joined  the  procession 
of  the  virtuous  Kakutstha.  Ministers,  groups  of  servants  with 
their  offspring,  their  kinsmen  and  their  flocks  joyfully  followed 
in  the  footsteps  of  their  master.  All  the  citizens,  happy  and 
healthy  people,  distinguished  by  their  good  qualities,  joined 
Raghava's  departure  and  all  the  men  and  women  with  their 
birds,  beasts  and  friends,  purified  of  their  sins,  went  forward 
cheerfully.  Devoted  to  Rama,  the  Monkeys,  having  bathed, 
delighted  and  satisfied,  cried  out  exultantly  with  all  their 
strength,  "  Kilakila  !  " 

In  that  multitude,  none  was  sad,  downcast  or  unhappy,  but  a 
universal  felicity  filled  all  to  the  highest  degree.  In  their  desire 
to  behold  Rama  taking  his  departure,  the  people  of  the  country, 
through  which  he  passed,  on  seeing  him,  took  their  places  in  his 
train.  Bears,  monkeys,  titans,  citizens,  with  deep  devotion, 
followed  him  in  the  utmost  serenity.  Even  the  invisible 
Beings  of  the  city  joined  Raghava's  procession  when  he  went  to 
heaven.  Beholding  him,  all  creatures,  animate  and  inanimate, 
lovingly  accompanied  him  on  that  journey.  Not  a  single  being, 
not  even  the  least  of  them,  was  to  be  seen  in  Ayodhya  ;  even 
those  born  of  animals  followed  in  Rama's  wake.

UTTARA    KANDA 

CHAPTER     I  10 

Rama  ascends  to  Heaven  with  the  other  Beings 

When  he  had  proceeded  about  six  miles,  the  Pride  of  the  Raghus 
beheld  the  sacred  waters  of  the  Sarayu  flowing  westwards, 
eddying  and  rippling  in  their  course,  and  he  went  on  further  to  the 
Goprataraka  Ghata,1  his  subjects  thronging  round  him  on  all  sides. 

At  that  moment,  as  Kakutstha  was  preparing  to  ascend  to 
heaven,  Brahma,  the  Grandsire  of  the  World,  surrounded  by  the 
Gods  and  the  illustrious  Rishis  adorned  with  jewels,  appeared 
seated  in  their  aerial  chariots,  and  the  whole  firmament  glowed 
with  a  transcendent  splendour,  a  marvellous  radiance  emanating 
from  the  lustre  of  those  heavenly  beings  of  virtuous  deeds. 
Pure,  balmy  and  fragrant  breezes  blew,  whilst  shower  upon 
shower  of  blossom  was  scattered  by  the  Gods.  Thereafter  to 
the  sound  of  a  myriad  instruments  and  the  singing  of  the 
Gandharvas  and  Apsaras,  Rama  stepped  into  the  waters,  where- 
upon the  Grandsire,  from  on  high,  uttered  these  words  :— 

"  Hail  O  Vishnu  !  Hail  O  Raghava  !  With  thy  God-like 
brothers,  now  enter  thine  eternal  abode !  Return  to  thine  own 
body  if  thou  so  dcsirest,  O  Long-armed  Warrior !  Occupy  the 
realm  of  Vishnu  or  the  shining  ether,  O  Mighty  God  !  Thou 
art  the  support  of  the  world,  though  there  are  some  who  do  not 
recognize  Thee  without  the  large-eyed  Maya,  thine  ancient 
Consort !  Thou  art  the  Inconceivable  One,  the  Great  Being, 
the  Indestructible,  the  Ageless  One.  Enter  into  thy  real  body 
if  Thou  so  desirest." 

Hearing  these  words  of  the  Grandsire,  the  supremely  virtuous 
Rama  formed  his  resolution  and  entered  Vishnu's  abode  in  his 
body  with  his  younger  brothers. 

Thereupon  Immortals  began  to  worship  that  God  who  had 
returned  to  His  form  as  Vishnu,  and  the  Sadhyas,  the  hosts  of 
Maruts  with  Indra  and  Agni  at  their  head,  the  celestial  companies 
of  Rishis,  the  Gandharvas  and  Apsaras,  Suparnas,  Nagas, 
Yakshas,  Daityas,  Dahavas  and  Rakshasas  and  all  the  dwellers 

1  Cattle  ford. 

«35 


THE    RAMAYANA    OF    VALMIKI 

in  heaven  felt  a  supreme  delight,  their  desires  fulfilled,  their  sins 
washed  away,  and  they  cried  out  "  Hail !  All  Hail !  " 

Then  the  all-resplendent  Vishnu  said  to  the  Grandsire : — 

"  Grant  to  each  of  these  my  subjects  a  suitable  abode.  They 
are  my  devotees  and  truly  deserving,  having  sacrificed  their 
lives  for  me !  " 

Thus  spoke  Vishnu,  and  the  God  Brahma,  Guru  of  the  Worlds, 
answered  saying : — 

"All  those  who  have  assembled  here  shall  go  to  the  region 
called  Santanakas  !  Yea,  even  the  beasts  who  die  meditating  on 
Thy  holy  Feet  shall  live  in  the  vicinity  of  Brahmaloka  where  I 
have  united  all  pleasurable  things.  The  monkeys  and  the  bears, 
the  manifestations  of  various  Deities  have  already  returned  to 
the  worlds  of  the  Gods,  from  whence  they  came  forth,  and 
Sugriva  has  entered  the  disc  of  the  sun  !  " 

Even  as  the  great  God  was  speaking,  the  monkeys  and  the 
bears,  having  assumed  their  pristine  forms,  came  to  Goprataraka 
Ghata  before  the  eyes  of  the  assembled  Gods.  At  that  time, 
whosoever  entered  the  waters  of  the  Sarayu  River,  yielded  up 
their  lives  gladly,  their  eyes  suffused  with  tears  of  ecstasy,  and, 
having  abandoned  their  bodies,  took  their  places  in  a  celestial 
chariot.  As  for  those  in  animal  form,  who  entered  the  waters  of 
the  Sarayu  in  hundreds,  they  ascended  to  the  Third  Heaven  in 
divinely  resplendent  bodies  and  they  appeared  as  effulgent  as  the 
Gods  in  their  celestial  lineaments.  AU  beings,  whether  animate 
or  inanimate,  who  entered  those  waters  attained  to  the  region  of 
the  Gods,  and,  in  their  turn,  the  bears,  monkeys  and  titans, 
abandoning  their  bodies  in  the  river,  also  attained  heaven. 

Having  granted  them  all  a  place  in  paradise,  the  Grandsire  of 
the  World  accompanied  by  the  Gods,  in  the  height  of  felicity, 
returned  to  the  Third  Heaven,  his  supreme  abode. 


CHAPTER    III 

The  supreme  Virtue  of  the  Ramayana 

This  then  is  the  whole  of  the  great  epic  and  its  sequel  called  the 
Ramayana,  which  was  composed  by  Valmiki  and  is  revered  by 
Brahma  Himself. 

636 


UTTARA    KANDA 

The  Lord  Vishnu  returned  to  Svargaloka  as  erstwhile,  He  Who 
pervades  the  Three  Worlds  and  all  they  contain,  both  the 
moving  and  the  fixed.  Gods,  Gandharvas,  Siddhas  and  great 
Rishis  in  heaven,  ever  listen  with  delight  tothepoem'Ramayana'. 
This  epic,  which  promotes  long  life,  grants  good  fortune  and 
destroys  sin,  is  equal  to  the  Veda  and  should  be  recited  by  the 
wise  to  men  of  faith. 

On  hearing  it,  he  who  has  no  son  will  obtain  a  son,  he  who  has 
no  fortune  will  become  wealthy ;  to  read  but  a  foot  of  this  poem 
will  absolve  him  from  all  sin.  He  who  commits  sins  daily  will 
be  wholly  purified  by  reciting  a  single  sloka. 

The  reciter  of  this  narrative  should  be  rewarded  with  raiment, 
cows  and  gold,  for,  if  he  is  satisfied,  all  the  Gods  are  satisfied. 
He  who  recites  this  epic  'Ramayana'  that  prolongs  life,  will  be 
blessed  with  bis  sons  and  grandsons  in  this  world  and  after  his 
death,  in  the  other  world.  He  who,  with  devotion,  recites  the 
'Ramayana'  at  the  hour  when  the  cows  are  loosed  or  at  noon  or  at 
dusk,  will  never  suffer  adversity. 

The  enchanting  City  of  Ayodhya,  having  remained  deserted 
for  countless  years,  will  be  re-peopled  by  a  Prince  named 
Rishabha. 

This  narrative,  that  grants  longevity,  with  the  'Bhavishya'  and 
'Uttara',  whose  author  is  the  son  of  Pracetas,  has  the  approval  of 
Brahma  Himself.
